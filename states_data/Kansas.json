Latham had come to Fort Hood from Fort Carson, Colorado, where he had undergone basic training between May and July 1959. In May 1961 York and Latham (aged 18 and 19 at the time, respectively) went AWOL and decided to travel to York's hometown of Jacksonville, Florida. On May 26, they encountered Edward J. Guidroz in Mix, Louisiana. York and Latham badly beat him and stole his truck. On May 29, they met Althea Ottavio and Patricia Hewett, visitors from Georgia, in Jacksonville, where they had spent the day, shopping. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, York and Latham strangled both women with their own stockings, stole their money, and dumped the car they had been driving in a ditch.[2]\n"

As a procedure for resolving the issue, Congress accepted the proposal of Senator Stephen A. Douglas, that the question be settled by popular sovereignty: the residents of the territory would decide the question by vote. This did not work, because there was no accepted definition of who was a resident of the territory and could therefore vote. Hoping to make Kansas a slave state, thousands of \"Border Ruffians\" from the neighboring slave state of Missouri poured into Kansas, some with the intent to live in Kansas, but more planning to return to Missouri as soon as they had voted. The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society and similar groups sponsored free-state farmers who would move to Kansas. The most famous of these was John Brown, who told the free-state Kansans that violence was unfortunately necessary if Kansas were to be a free state. He put this into practice himself at the Pottawatomie massacre of 1856. As it was put later by his son John Brown, Jr., \"only force and fire-arms kept slavery out of Kansas\".[1]\n"

From October 23 to November 11, 1855, the Topeka Constitutional Convention met in the building and produced the antislavery Topeka Constitution.\nThe proposed Topeka Constitution would have brought Kansas into the Union as a free state. The United States House of Representatives approved this constitution in July 1856, but the Southern-dominated Senate failed to fully consider the document. Parts of the Topeka Constitution were incorporated in the Constitution of Kansas (the Wyandotte Constitution) drafted in 1859.[1][2][3]\n"

It first sat along the eastern border of Fort Riley, but today is within the boundaries of the base. A 2.8-acre (1.1\u00a0ha) site on which the building stands was provided to the Kansas Historical Society through a revocable license from the War Department in 1928.[2] It is separated from the river by a grove of trees, and Union Pacific Railroad lines run parallel to the building close to its north side.\n"

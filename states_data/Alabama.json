The next day, the miners brought Meadows, a new arrival to the area, and after a brief investigation, determined him to be guilty.[2] The woman begged the mob not to lynch Meadows, as she was unsure if he was the criminal, but the mob went forward with the lynching and killed him near the Pratt mines.

From 1886 to 1890, he and his gang robbed express trains in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, the Indian Territory and Texas while pursued by hundreds of lawmen throughout the southern half of the United States, including the Pinkerton National Detective Agency.\nBorn in Lamar County, Alabama on December 11, 1855, Rube Burrow worked on the family farm in Alabama until the age of 18 when he moved to Stephenville, Texas to work on his uncle's ranch. By all accounts, Burrow fully intended to become a rancher by saving up enough money to buy a farm, marry and start a family.[1] He attempted farming but his wife, Virginia Catherine Alverson Burrow, died of yellow fever in 1881, leaving him to care for two small children. He remarried in 1884 and moved to Alexander, Texas, but when his crops failed he turned to robbing trains with his brother Jim in 1886.[2]\nHis unexpected turn to crime occurred on December 11, 1886 when he and his brother Jim teamed with W.L Brock, Leonard Brock, Henderson Brumley, and Nep Thornton[2] to rob the Denver & Fort Worth Express while returning from a trip to the Indian Territory. Burrow and the other men waited at the train depot at Bellevue, Texas until the train arrived. Drawing their guns at the crew, in full view of the passengers, they entered the train, but were only able to collect $300 (the Fort Worth Daily Gazette reported the loss of $100 and ten to fifteen watches[3]) as the passengers were able to hide most of their valuables by the time the outlaws passed through. In one of the cars, a U.S. Army sergeant of 24th Infantry Regiment (United States)[3] and two privates were escorting two deserters in shackles. The passengers were able to persuade the sergeant not to fire at the outlaws, however he was later censured for cowardice by his superiors following.

The following year, he was convicted and sentenced to 99 years imprisonment, with a chance of parole after serving several years.\n",

While participating in the Selma to Montgomery marches actions in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, he was murdered by white segregationists, dying of head injuries in the hospital two days after being severely beaten. Three men were tried for Reeb's murder but were acquitted by an all-white jury. His murder remains officially unsolved.\nReeb was born on January 1, 1927, in Wichita, Kansas, to Mae (Fox) and Harry Reeb.[1][2] He was raised in Kansas and Casper, Wyoming.[3]  He attended Natrona County High School and graduated in 1945, after which he joined the Army despite the fact that his commitment to the ministry made him exempt from service. After basic training, he was sent to Anchorage, Alaska, as a clerk typist for the headquarters of Special Troops. He was honorably discharged eighteen months later in December 1946 as Technical Sergeant, Third Class.[4] After his time in the Army, Reeb continued his schooling. Initially, he attended classes in his home town at Casper Junior College, before moving on to St. Olaf College, in 1947, where he received his A.B. cum laude in 1950.[5] He then entered Princeton Theological Seminary in Princeton, New Jersey,[6] where he earned his B.D. in 1953.[4] Three days later, Reeb was ordained a Presbyterian minister at the First Presbyterian Church of Casper.[7] After this he accepted a position at the Philadelphia General Hospital as Chaplain to Hospitals for the Philadelphia Presbyter. To become a more effective counselor, he went back to school, enrolling at Conwell School of Theology, where he earned an S.T.M. in Pastoral Counseling in 1955.[4]\nAs a scholar of theology, Reeb grew away from traditionalist Presbyterian teachings and was drawn to the Unitarian Universalist church.[7] In March 1957, he resigned his Presbyterian Chaplaincy and contacted the American Unitarian Association about transferring his fellowship from Presbyterian to Unitarian. Reeb appreciated the church's emphasis on social action,[8] and he became active in the civil rights movement during the 1960s.[3]\n",

While on death row, Hamm developed lymphatic cancer, which made it difficult to impossible to achieve the venous access necessary to administer the drugs used in lethal injections. Despite months of warning by Hamm's attorney and human rights observers and a decades' long legal battle, the Alabama Department of Corrections attempted to execute Hamm on February 22, 2018. The unsuccessful execution attempt lasted nearly three hours and drew international attention. In March 2018, Hamm and the state of Alabama reached a confidential settlement, the terms of which precluded a second execution attempt, giving Hamm a de facto sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, although his sentence was not formally commuted. Hamm remained in prison until his death from cancer-related complications in 2021.\nHamm was born on February 14, 1957,[1] and grew up in northwest Alabama and was the tenth of twelve children.[2] While he was growing up, Hamm's father and each of his six older brothers spent time in jail.[2] In an interview, one of Hamm's sisters described their childhood home as \u201cconstant hell all the time\u201d and recalled that her father told his children that \u201cIf you don\u2019t go out and steal, then you\u2019re not a Hamm.\u201d[2] From an early age, Hamm struggled in school.

Hamm entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to five years in prison.[2] Years later, the alleged victim confessed that no robbery had ever taken place and Hamm's court-appointed attorney admitted that he had been \u201ctoo busy and overworked to give this case the time and attention it needed.\u201d[2] Hamm was arrested other times for burglary, assault, and grand larceny.\n",

In 1997, at the age of 19, Jackson was arrested for the murder of Lefrick Moore that occurred during the commission of a robbery in Montgomery, Alabama.[2]  During the investigation, Jackson initially told detectives that he did not know the three other co-defendants, and was not present at the time of the murder. Montgomery Police Detective Andrew Signore, having learned from the other defendants that just before the murder, Jackson had purchased a soft drink from a local drive-thru, informed him that his fingerprints were found on a Dairy Queen cup located inside the victim's stolen vehicle.  At the time, Detective Signore did not know if any latent fingerprints had been discovered on the cup but advanced this deception to encourage Jackson to admit to knowing the other defendants and being present with them at some point during the night of the murder.  Jackson then admitted that he knew the other defendants and had been with them earlier in the day before the murder.  He then asked to amend his statement a third time to admit he was present at the time of the murder and was armed with a .380 handgun.[3] Following a jury trial, he was found guilty of capital murder. In sentencing Jackson, the presiding judge, William Gordon, overrode the jury's unanimous recommendation of a life sentence and instead imposed the death sentence. Judicial override of a jury's sentencing recommendation is permitted under Alabama law. Later, in a sworn deposition, juror Jan Burkes expressed uncertainty that Jackson, one of four defendants charged with this crime, fired the shot that killed Moore.[4][5]\n\nThis United States biographical article related to crime is a stub.

In addition, if the defendant cannot afford a lawyer, the court must appoint one sufficiently far in advance of trial to permit the lawyer to prepare adequately for the trial.\nPowell was the first time the Court had reversed a state criminal conviction for a violation of a criminal procedural provision of the United States Bill of Rights.[1] In effect, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause included at least part of the right to counsel referred to in the Sixth Amendment, making that much of the Bill of Rights binding on the states. Before Powell, the Court had reversed state criminal convictions only for racial discrimination in jury selection \u2014 a practice that violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[1]\nIn March 1931, nine black men\u2014Charlie Weems, Ozie Powell, Clarence Norris, Olen Montgomery, Willie Roberson, Haywood Patterson, Andrew (Andy) Wright, Leroy (Roy) Wright and Eugene Williams, later known as the Scottsboro Boys\u2014were accused of raping two young white women, Ruby Bates and Victoria Price.\n",

Many believe that he was wrongfully convicted and sentenced for the 1977 murder of a young white woman in Monroe County of that state. The only evidence against Baldwin in the murder was his own confession, which he later retracted. He said that it was coerced by the local police in Wilcox County, Alabama, where he was arrested; they beat and tortured him under interrogation.[2] A 1985 letter by his co-defendant Edward Dean Horsley surfaced in 1996, after Horsley had been executed for first-degree murder in the case. He wrote that he had acted alone in the rape and murder of Naomi Rolon, and that Baldwin had not known of her death.\nDeath penalty opponents regard this case as one in which racial bias contributed to the wrongful conviction by an all-white jury of an 18-year-old black man, in a county that was 46% black in population. Further, they believe he was executed despite evidence that he did not commit Rolon's murder.[3] The appeals process was marked by conflicts of interest, as the presiding judge at Baldwin's trial also ruled on the appeals, against common practice. Before Baldwin's execution in 1999, leading political and religious figures petitioned Governor Don Siegelman for clemency on his behalf. Siegelman refused, saying that although he was \"deeply troubled by some of the matters raised,\" he wrote \"this matter does not rise to a level that warrants clemency.\"[4]\nBrian Keith Baldwin was born in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1958.[1][5] As a teenager, he got into trouble with the law.

While locally-told stories of his life usually say that he was hanged on trumped-up charges of desertion from the Confederate Army, other sources show that he was killed for allegedly aiding pro-Union renegades in the area.  Whatever the reason for his murder, a shallow hole dug beneath Sketoe's feet during the hanging (to accommodate his large frame) ultimately led to stories about \"the hole that won't stay filled.\"  According to witnesses, this hole never disappeared\u2014even after being filled numerous times\u2014retaining its original dimensions for the next 125 years.\nSketoe's tale became a staple of Southern folklore, and was later immortalized by Alabama author Kathryn Tucker Windham in her 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey.  His hanging site remained a local tourist attraction for decades, and continues to attract visitors even though the hole itself recently disappeared due to flooding in the area.  Today the site of Sketoe's lynching lies beneath the Alabama Highway 134 bridge over the Choctawhatchee River, and a monument to Sketoe has been erected nearby.\nWhile much of Bill Sketoe's story is difficult to reconstruct with certainty, he is known to have resided in Newton, Alabama prior to the Civil War,[1] and to have been lynched there on December 3, 1864.[2]    The main source for his tale is Kathryn Tucker Windham's 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey, which tells the legend of Sketoe's life and death as it has been related for generations in and around Newton.  However, certain details of this story\u2014such as Sketoe's alleged Confederate war service and the precise reason for his lynching\u2014are subject to controversy based upon other available records.  While the legend attributes his death to an ultimately romantic cause (Sketoe's desire to care for his desperately ill spouse), other accounts hint at far more sinister reasons behind his demise, involving Sketoe's alleged (but never proven) collaboration with Unionist local guerrillas.\n",

Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine race riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 blacks and 5 whites were killed. Other major events of Red Summer were the Chicago race riot and Washington D.C. Race Riot, which caused 38 and 39 deaths, respectively. Both riots had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.[1]\nIn December of 1920, the wife of a white farmer in Hurtsboro was allegedly assaulted by a Black man.[2] Her husband alerted by her screams ran to her aid but was knocked out by the assailant.

Years later it was found that the FBI had accumulated evidence against the named suspects that had not been revealed to the prosecutors by order of J. Edgar Hoover.

A group of white teenage boys saw 18-year-old Haywood Patterson on the train and attempted to push him off, claiming that it was \"a white man's train\".[1] A group of whites gathered rocks and attempted to force all of the black men from the train. Patterson and the other black passengers were able to ward off the group. The humiliated white teenagers jumped or were forced off the train and reported to the city's sheriff that they had been attacked by a group of black teenagers.

Johnson at the White House to discuss policies and legislation for the Great Society and War on Poverty.[17] The Republican Party was wary of Reuther, leading presidential candidate Richard Nixon to say about John F. Kennedy during the 1960 election, \"I can think of nothing so detrimental to this nation than for any President to owe his election to, and therefore be a captive of, a political boss like Walter Reuther.\"[18] Conservative politician Barry Goldwater declared that Reuther \"was more dangerous to our country than Sputnik or anything Soviet Russia might do.\"[19]\n",

He is considered the top sports writer in Alabama newspaper history. He became sports editor of The Birmingham News in 1959, replacing Zip Newman, and won numerous state and national awards. His son, Phillip Marshall, was a sports writer for The Huntsville News, The Birmingham Post-Herald, The Huntsville Times and sports editor of The Montgomery Advertiser.[2] Three other children - David, Ellen and Matt - are no longer living. Marshall died on September 25, 1969, from a self-inflicted gunshot. He was 49.\nBenny Marshall wrote a sports column for The Birmingham News. Amongst the variety of his writing styles, one particular style stood out from the rest. He could tell a story in his column in a way that touched people. Fifty years later, there are still some who can remember a Benny Marshall story bringing tears their [then] young eyes. Marshall covered the top football games played by the state's two major universities. He was a dutiful reporter of the facts and the big plays, an entirely different style than he used in many of his columns. Sometimes he would simply report independent factoids that were disconnected. The title on those columns was, \"Noted in passing...\". Other times, Marshall might have identified a sports story that had heart. When he was inspired, he could make that story come alive with the brief touching tapestry he weaved with his well chosen words. Marshall's talent for capturing the depth and character of humanity as played out in a sports story endeared him to sports lovers throughout the state.\n\n",

As the museum describes in its mission statement, it recognizes other people, events, and actions which furthered America's Right to Vote since \"the Founding Fathers first planted the seeds of democracy in 1776.\"[1][2][3] The museum was founded by Faya Ora Rose Tour\u00e9 and Marie Foster.[4]\nIt is located near the Edmund Pettus Bridge. On this bridge on March 7, 1965, voting rights marchers who left the city for a planned walk to Montgomery were beaten and clubbed by Dallas County posse and Alabama State Troopers, in what became known as \"Bloody Sunday\". They had passed into the county on a planned walk of 54 miles to Montgomery, Alabama's state capital. This treatment was nationally televised and covered by major media, arousing national outrage. After gaining federal protection from President Lyndon B. Johnson and a federal court order protecting their right to march, thousands of people left Selma on March 21, reaching Montgomery several days later. By then, they had been joined by thousands more, black and white, and 25,000 marchers entered the state capital to press for protection of constitutional voting rights. Later that summer the Voting Rights Act of 1965, introduced by the Johnson administration, was passed by Congress and signed by the president. \nThe museum's several rooms and exhibit areas include the \"Footprints to Freedom\" room, which features molded cast-footprints of some of the activists who participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches; a \"Women's Suffrage Room\", honoring the contributions of African-American and other women who secured women's voting rights in the U.S.; the \"Selma Room\", also known as the \"Marie Foster\" room, where voting records, clothes worn by people beaten during the march, and other artifacts of these social movements are displayed; and a room where people who participated in the 1960s marches can leave personal messages and chronicle their memories.[1] The museum also features a large blow-up of a portion of an iconic photograph taken on the Selma to Montgomery march by Look magazine photographer James Karales.\n",

One perpetrator, Henry Hays, was executed by electric chair in 1997, while another, James Knowles, was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty and testifying against Hays. A third man was convicted as an accomplice and also sentenced to life in prison, and a fourth was indicted but died before his trial could be completed.\nHays's execution was the first in Alabama since 1913 for a white-on-black crime. It was the only execution of a KKK member during the 20th century for the murder of an African American.[3] Donald's mother, Beulah Mae Donald, brought a civil suit for wrongful death against the United Klans of America (UKA), to which the attackers belonged. In 1987 a jury awarded her damages of $7 million, which bankrupted the organization. This set a precedent for civil legal action for damages against other racist hate groups.\n",

Tillman marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and was among the SCLC Field Staff to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge  in Selma, Alabama in the Selma to Montgomery marches on 7 March 1965.\nTillman had her first involvement in Chicago politics later in 1965 when King sent her there to campaign for better housing, education and employment conditions for blacks. This campaign marked the start of King's effort to improve socio-economic conditions for blacks. Tillman was involved in organizing King's move into a Chicago tenement in early 1966 and the launch of his campaign in July 1966. By 1967, Tillman and her husband, Jimmy, moved to San Francisco shortly after their marriage and became involved in a successful campaign to improve public transport services to their neighborhood.\n",

He teaches her and her friend Rachel (Stephanie Zandra Peyton) that when asked, \"Children, what do you want?\" their answer should be \"Freedom.\" He also teaches her that everyone deserves to be treated with fairness, regardless of the color of their skin, and that children also have a battle to fight. Sheyann wants to get involved and skips school to sneak into the meetings. One night a friend of Sheyann's named Jimmie Lee Jackson is killed. To draw attention to the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson, it is decided that a 54-mile march to the state capital of Alabama will take place. Marchers will present a petition to Governor Wallace to protest that Negroes are not being treated fairly.

Evans was born in Beaumont, Texas, and was executed at the Holman Correctional Facility near Atmore, Alabama, at the age of 33.\nAfter his 1976 parole from an Indiana prison, Evans and fellow convict Wayne Ritter (January 30, 1954 \u2013 August 28, 1987) embarked on a two-month-long crime spree involving, by Evans's own admission, over thirty armed robberies, nine kidnappings, and two extortion schemes across seven states. On January 5, 1977, he and Ritter robbed and killed Edward Nassar, a pawn shop owner in Mobile, Alabama, while his two young daughters were in the store. The perpetrators fled but were captured on March 7 by FBI agents in Little Rock, Arkansas. The evidence recovered was the gun used to shoot Nassar in the back and another gun stolen from the pawn shop.\nAlthough he gave a detailed confession, prosecutors refused to accept his plea of guilty because they wanted Evans sentenced to death, and under Alabama law, this is only allowed following a conviction by a jury. Evans was tried in State Circuit Court in Mobile, Alabama on April 26, 1977, for first-degree murder committed during the commission of a robbery. During the trial, Evans again admitted to his crime and stated that he did not feel remorse and that under the same circumstances, he would kill again. Furthermore, he threatened that if the jury did not sentence him to death, he would escape and murder each of them. Despite his testimony, the jury was instructed to consider all the evidence and return a guilty verdict only if the prosecutors had left no reasonable doubt. After less than fifteen minutes of deliberation, the jury convicted Evans of the capital offense charged, thus imposing the death penalty.\n",

Ray received a stay from the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals the day before his execution, but Alabama moved for the Supreme Court to vacate the stay of execution. The Supreme Court vacated the stay and Ray was executed on his scheduled date.[1][2] He was one of 22 people executed in the United States in 2019.\nThe ruling was criticized by many commentators.[3]\nOn March 28, 2019, less than two months after Ray's execution, the Supreme Court stayed the execution of Patrick Murphy in Texas over concerns that not allowing him to have a Buddhist spiritual advisor instead of the Christian chaplain or Muslim imams, only two religions' spiritual advisors permitted by Texas to be present in the execution chamber, would violate his Constitutional rights. The ruling on Murphy renewed attention to Ray's case due to the similarity and proximity of the cases.[4][5] and the lack of explanation from justices Alito, Kavanaugh and Roberts for their latest positions.[6]\n",

Collier unlocked it to allow fellow employees Nathaniel Baker and Bryant Archer to take out the trash. Upon entry, Melson and Peraita ordered Archer, Baker, Collier, and another employee, Tamika Collins, into the restaurant's office and demanded that they empty the safe. They complied, after which Melson ordered the group to get inside the restaurant's freezer. Shortly after locking them in the freezer, Melson unlocked the door and opened fire. Baker, Collier and Collins all died of their wounds before paramedics arrived. Archer was shot four times, but he survived and was able to crawl to the restaurant's office to call 911.[3][4]\nMelson was convicted of his role in the crime, sentenced to death on May 17, 1996, and placed on death row under Alabama Department of Corrections ID 0000Z601.[1] Peraita was sentenced to life without parole. He killed a fellow inmate on December 11, 1999, and was given a death sentence in October 2001. Melson had two execution dates set in 2010, both of which were stayed. On April 5, 2017, Melson had an execution date set for June 8, 2017.[5] He received a temporary stay from an appellate court on June 2, but the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the stay on June 6 without comment. At 5:45 p.m. on the night of the execution, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a temporary stay so Justice Clarence Thomas could review Melson's appeals. The stay was later lifted and the execution began at 9:55 p.m. Melson was pronounced dead at 10:27 p.m.[6]\n",

Despite her progressive stance on prison reform, Tutwiler also pandered to a segregationist approach to the prison system, advocating the separation of prison inmates by race as it is \"important for public welfare to separate them in all other relations- in schools, in travel, and in social life, it would be better for both races if this could be done here also.\"[3]\n",

Lee.[1] His uncle was Thomas ap Catesby Jones, a naval officer during the War of 1812 and Mexican\u2013American War. Jones was appointed a midshipman in the United States Navy in 1836, and served extensively at sea, receiving promotion to the rank of lieutenant in 1849.

Mrs. Ables, a widowed mother of three, was found unconscious but alive three days earlier with severe head injuries and indications that she had been raped. No eyewitnesses were reported and it is not clear why suspicion rested immediately upon Easley. Accounts emphasize that he confessed, though one account claims he admitted only the beating and denied the rape. He was arrested and taken to the jail in Jacksonville about 14 miles from where the crime occurred. At 1\u00a0pm a mob of between one hundred and fifty and three hundred persons took Easley from the jail by force and lynched him within the city limits during the daytime. Mrs. Ables died five weeks after the lynching took place.\nNewspaper reports suggest that the crime was committed on Thursday, January 16, just 4 days before the lynching. Mrs. Moses Ables was reportedly found the following day unconscious, suffering from multiple skull fractures and apparently raped.[1] She was presumed to be near death though she survived several weeks following the assault and subsequent lynching.[2]\nIn the press the victim is represented only as Mrs. Ables, Mrs. Moses Ables,[3][4] or the daughter of James Beard.[5] From the 1860[6] and 1870[7] federal censuses it appears that her given name may have been Sophrony or Safrona.\n",

From 1962, with the support of the Voter Education Project, SNCC committed to the registration and mobilization of black voters in the Deep South. Affiliates such as the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and the Lowndes County Freedom Organization in Alabama also worked to increase the pressure on federal and state government to enforce constitutional protections.\nBy the mid-1960s the measured nature of the gains made, and the violence with which they were resisted, were generating dissent from the group's principles of nonviolence, of white participation in the movement, and of field-driven, as opposed to national-office, leadership and direction. At the same time some original organizers were now working with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and others were being lost to a de-segregating Democratic Party and to federally-funded anti-poverty programs. Following an aborted merger with the Black Panther Party in 1968, SNCC effectively dissolved.\nBecause of the successes of its early years, SNCC is credited with breaking down barriers, both institutional and psychological, to the empowerment of African-American communities.\n",

In the 1988 trial, under a controversial Alabama doctrine called \"judicial override\", the judge imposed the death penalty, although the jury had voted for a sentence of life imprisonment.\nFrom 1990 to 1993, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals turned down four appeals. In 1993, after McMillian had served six years on Alabama's death row, the Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the lower court decision and ruled that he had been wrongfully convicted.\nThe controversial case received national attention beginning in the fall of 1992. Bryan Stevenson, McMillian's defense attorney, raised awareness on the CBS News program 60 Minutes. Journalist Pete Earley covered it in his book Circumstantial Evidence: Death, Life, and Justice in a Southern Town (1995).[2] Stevenson featured this early case of his career in a TED talk and in his memoir Just Mercy (2014).

After being arrested for the October 1976 murder of Cheryl Payton, Whisenhant confessed to killing three other women. He was sentenced to death in Alabama in September 1977, and was executed in May 2010 at Holman Correctional Facility via lethal injection. At the time of his execution, Whisenhant was Alabama's longest serving death row inmate, spending thirty-two years, eight months, and twenty days on death row.[2]\nThomas Warren Whisenhant was born on January 29, 1947, in Prichard, Alabama, the last of four children born to Willie and Emma Whisenhant.[3] He came from a low-income family, which was ruled by his mother, a domineering woman who would constantly argue with and frequently attack her physically weak and alcoholic husband and who also encouraged her children to do the same. Such altercations often occurred when Whisenhant's father would get drunk on moonshine and try to seduce his wife, who would always reject him. She reserved her anger and abuse only for her husband and instead spoiled Whisenhant, of whom she was overprotective. Whisenhant was made to share a bed with his mother until the age of 7 and continued to share the same bedroom with her until the age of 16, by which time he had, according to his sister, become moody and violent.[4] Also by his teenage years, Whisenhant was constantly accompanied by his mother, who never let him out of her sight. According to a psychologist, Whisenhant resented her.[4]\nOn May 6, 1963, 72-year-old widow Lexie Haynes was fatally shot in Prichard. Police arrived at the scene and found the murder weapon in an empty lot next to Whisenhant's family home. Whisenhant, who was 16 at the time, was immediately suspected, as he had recently been charged with robbing a blind woman. According to a retired Prichard police captain, the robbery charge against Whisenhant was later thrown out of court due to a technicality. Police questioned Whisenhant about the murder; however, his family provided him with an alibi and claimed he had been at home when the shooting occurred.[4] Before the shooting occurred, Whisenhant and his friends had been playing with a stolen handgun. A witness later said Whisenhant had taken a bullet from the revolver, held it up, and stated it would soon kill somebody.[5] Police later revealed that Haynes had spoken with Whisenhant about this behavior, which was why they suspected he killed her. However, for unknown reasons, Whisenhant was never brought to trial for the murder of Haynes.[6][7]\n",

His family grew up poor, so Bernard started working odd jobs to gain more income by the age of 11.[2] His jobs included cashiering, meat cutting, delivering produce, and collecting change at a coffee shop.[2] When reminiscing on his childhood, Bernard says: \"I had to grow up rapidly. In other words, I didn't have a childhood.\"[3]\nDespite being black in the south, Bernard says he went to school in an integrated elementary school, and eventually began to go to schools that were still segregated. While he was at the integrated school he says that \"even though it wasn't segregated, I could still see the contrast between the two worlds.\"[3]  Bernard has clear recollections of some of the racism that he experienced at a young age. When Bernard was seven years old, he was heading downtown with his grandmother, Ma Foster, so they decided to catch a cable car. One of the segregation laws regarding cable cars was that black people would pay at the front door, and then enter through the back door. When His grandmother paid the cable car driver, the driver started driving before either of them could board, pocketing their money and leaving them stranded.[4] He says this is one of the first instances where he realized he wanted to do something about how his people were being treated.\n",

In March 1965, Liuzzo heeded the call of Martin Luther King Jr. and traveled from Detroit, Michigan, to Selma, Alabama, in the wake of the Bloody Sunday attempt at marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Liuzzo participated in the successful Selma to Montgomery marches and helped with coordination and logistics. At the age of 39, while driving back from a trip shuttling fellow activists to the Montgomery airport, she was fatally hit by shots fired from a pursuing car containing Ku Klux Klan members Collie Wilkins, William Eaton, Eugene Thomas, and Gary Thomas Rowe, the last of whom was actually an undercover informant working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).[1][2] Although the State of Alabama was unable to secure a murder conviction, Wilkins, Eaton, and Thomas were charged in federal court with conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act, a Reconstruction civil rights statute. On December 3, the trio was found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in Southern legal history.\nRowe testified that Wilkins had fired two shots into Liuzzo on the order of Thomas,[citation needed] and was placed in the witness protection program by the FBI.[3] In an effort to deflect attention from having employed Rowe as an informant, the FBI produced disinformation[4][5] for politicians and the press, stating that Liuzzo was a member of the Communist Party, heroin addict,[6] and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African-Americans involved in the Civil Rights Movement.[7] Liuzzo's involvement in the civil rights movement was scrutinized and she was condemned by various racist organizations. In 1983, the Liuzzo family filed a lawsuit against the FBI after learning about the FBI's activities, but the suit was dismissed.\nIn addition to other honors, Liuzzo's name is today inscribed on the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama, created by Maya Lin.\n",

Although there was a price on his head for some years, he evaded capture through ingenuity and exceptional athletic abilities. He was eventually shot dead in an ambush at a store he was known to visit. Slater is celebrated in the folk-ballad Railroad Bill, which has been recorded by numerous artists, including Lonnie Donegan, Taj Mahal, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Roger McGuinn, Doc Watson, and Dave Alvin. \nLittle is known about the personal life of the individual who became notorious as Railroad Bill.[1] His true name, location of his birth, and details of his family have been debated since his criminal career ended in 1896.[2] What is known is that he once traveled with a circus and learned showmanship and the skills of a performer.[3] He joined a turpentine company in South Carolina and continued with the firm when it moved to Baldwin County, Alabama, and Bluff Springs, Florida.[4] In the turpentine camps he was known as Morris Slater\u2014a profoundly athletic, \"top notch\" laborer and affable individual.[3][5]\nSlater became an antagonist of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad after a brakeman found him stealing a ride to Mobile, Alabama, and threw him off the moving train. In turn, the turpentine worker fired his rifle at the brakeman.[6] That altercation led Slater into a personal vendetta against the company, in which he would wound several trainmen, commandeer a train and force it out of the station, and threaten the life of James I. McKinnie, Superintendent of L&N's Mobile and Montgomery Division.[7][8][9] The company responded by dispatching detectives to investigate the offender and offering a $350 reward for his capture.[10] Not knowing Slater's name, detectives simply called him Railroad Bill, which was the alias of another L&N antagonist who lived in Mobile.[11] Slater embraced the moniker, and it became the name reporters typically used in writing hundreds of newspaper articles about his criminal activities.\n",

John Lewis, who was injured in the Selma to Montgomery marches, President Obama discussed the Selma to Montgomery marches in the context of historic events: \"There are places, and moments in America where this nation's destiny has been decided, ...

Lackey became the first person executed by the state of Alabama since October 20, 2011; executions had been partly slowed because of a legal dispute over the drugs being used.[1] No further executions would occur in Alabama until the January 2016 execution of Christopher Brooks.\nLackey broke into Newman's Limestone County home on Halloween night in 2005. Lackey had been told by Newman's grandson that there was a vault in the home containing gold bars and cash. Newman made a call to 911 on the night of the murder, in which he could be heard saying, \u201cDon\u2019t do that,\u201d \u201dLeave me alone\u201d and \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Lackey could be heard repeatedly asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s the vault?\u201d according to court records.[2] It is believed that Newman grabbed his gun and shot Lackey, who then stabbed Newman with a knife about seventy times. Lackey also shot Newman in the chest with his own gun. Police arrived at the residence five minutes after the call was made, where they found Newman's body.\nLackey drove to a convenience store, where he called an ambulance. He was taken to Huntsville Hospital and treated for the gunshot wound. Police received a phone call indicating that Lackey was at the hospital. He was taken into custody after being released from treatment.[3]\n",

Freedmen comprised a majority of the population and had been electing Republican candidates to office. Members of an Alabama chapter of the White League, a paramilitary group supporting the Democratic Party's drive to regain political power in the county and state, used firearms to ambush black Republicans at the polls.[1]\nIn Eufaula, members of the White League killed an estimated 15-40 black voters and wounded 70, while driving away more than 1,000 unarmed black people at the polls. In attacking the polling place in Spring Hill, the League effectively hijacked the elections. They turned all Republicans out of office and Democratic candidates took a majority of offices up for election.\nThe White League had formed in 1874 as an insurgent, white Democratic paramilitary group in Grant Parish and nearby parishes[2] on the Red River of the South in Louisiana. The League was founded by members of the white militia who had committed the Colfax Massacre in Louisiana in 1873, killing numerous black people in order to turn out Republicans from parish offices as part of the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election. Historians such as George Rabe consider groups such as the White League and Red Shirts as a \"military arm\" of the Democratic Party. Their members worked openly to disrupt Republican meetings, and attacked and intimidated voters to suppress black voting. They courted press attention rather than operating secretly, as had the Ku Klux Klan.\n",

He is buried at New Pleasant Valley Cemetery in Letohatchee, Alabama.\nOn the night of January 22, 1957, a small group of Klansmen gathered, armed with pistols and a rifle. They got into a car to look for Willie Edwards, an African American, who had recently been hired as a driver for Winn-Dixie. They thought that he was sleeping with a white woman. Willie had come home from work and an hour later got a call from his boss asking to come back in because one of the other workers had called in sick.  Edwards left to go to work on the afternoon of January 23, never to return home. It is thought he was abducted and beaten  by the Klansmen as they drove him around Montgomery. Then they stopped at the Tyler-Goodwin Bridge, along the Alabama River near Montgomery, and pointed a gun at Edwards, before commanding him to jump off the bridge. He fell 125 feet (38.1 m) to his death. Three months passed before his body was discovered washed up on the shores of the river.  Officials stated that decomposition made it impossible to determine the cause of his death.\nIn 1976, then State Attorney General Bill Baxley re-opened the Edwards case.\nFour people were arrested and charged with Edwards's murder: Sonny Kyle Livingston Jr. (38), Henry Alexander (46), James York (73), and Raymond Britt Jr.  Britt broke the long silence with his affidavit (in exchange for immunity), dated February 20, 1976. In the statement to Attorney General Bill Baxley, Britt described how on the night of January 23, 1957, he along with three other men beat and forced Edwards to jump off the Tyler-Goodwin Bridge into the Alabama River. Alabama Judge Frank Embry, however, dismissed the charges, even with Britt's sworn testimony, because no cause of death was ever established. He concluded that \"merely forcing a person to jump from a bridge does not naturally and probably lead to the death of such person.\"[1]\n",

Beck was tried for capital murder. Under the Code of Alabama, Section 13-11-2 (1975), the requisite intent to kill could not be supplied by the felony murder doctrine. Felony murder was thus a lesser-included offense of the capital crime of robbery with an intentional killing. Under the statute, the judge was specifically prohibited from giving the jury the option of convicting for the lesser-included offense. Absent the statutory ban on such an instruction, Beck's testimony would have entitled him to an instruction on felony murder\nIn the lower courts, Beck attacked the ban on the grounds that the Alabama statute was the same as the mandatory death penalty statutes that the Court had been striking down in recent holdings.\n",

Her efforts included the first successful civil rights campaign to integrate lunch counters (Nashville);[1] the Freedom Riders, who desegregated interstate travel;[2] co-founding the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC); and co-initiating the Alabama Voting Rights Project and working on the Selma Voting Rights Movement. This helped gain Congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which authorized the federal government to oversee and enforce state practices to ensure that African Americans and other minorities were not prevented from registering and voting.\nIn July 2022, Nash was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden.[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nLynn Marie Messer (June 4, 1962 \u2013 July 8, 2014) was an American woman who was last seen alive during the early hours of July 8, 2014, in the Bloomsdale, Missouri, farmhouse she shared with her husband. Her disappearance generated national news coverage. On November 1, 2016, her remains were found on the edge of the farm where she had lived.[1]\nAt approximately 4:00\u00a0a.m. on July 8, 2014, Kerry Messer woke up to find that his wife Lynn wasn't in bed beside him.[2] He looked around the house for her, noticing that Lynn's personal belongings\u2014including her ID, passport, wallet, cell phone, car keys, and the walking boot she used to help protect her broken toe\u2014were all still in the house.[3] Kerry checked the areas around their farm where Lynn would normally be as well as the gravel pathways and roads leading to their farmhouse, and began checking locations beyond the farm that morning before his son called the sheriff's office.  After 10 months of cooperation and over 40 in-person and telephone visits with law enforcement, they refused to share where they were in the investigation. The last known communication Lynn had with anyone other than her husband was a phone call she made at 11:30\u00a0p.m. on the night of July 7.[3][4]\nPolice quickly classified Lynn as an \"endangered person,\" given the fact that she had a broken toe at the time and left without her walking boot, leading police to speculate that she found herself in physical danger. Local police, professional Search and Rescue, K-9 Teams, highway patrol, and the FBI were called in to locate her.[4] Search dogs picked up a scent trail leading away from the farmhouse on the day Lynn disappeared, but later that day Kerry asked his son Abram to move their herd of cows to a different field, which destroyed the scent trail.[5] The Messer farmhouse was meticulously searched on the first day and on later dates by both local and federal authorities. No evidence indicated any harm or wrongdoing by her husband Kerry, or any indication of a break-in or struggle of any kind, leading police to believe that she hadn't been abducted.[2][6] Neither the police nor Kerry believed that Lynn had decided to run away from home; she hadn't taken any personal belongings with her, she appeared to enjoy her marriage and family life, and she had recently been discussing exciting future plans such as holidays and Bible classes.[7] After four days of intensive searching, the local Sheriff said he was convinced that Lynn was not on the farm. The official search was suspended and law enforcement supported the family as they continued searching. One of Lynn's sons and one of her brothers-in-law took over directing volunteer search teams for the next 125 days, expending thousands of man-hours in the search.\nIt was later revealed that Lynn had left a note prior to her disappearance, but the note's contents were not revealed by Kerry Messer. In a subsequent interview, he made public a portion of the note.[8] The full note had previously been provided to Sheriff's personnel, but Kerry said only that \"It was some kind of note of finality, but I don't know what that means and to this day I don't understand it.\" He also said that \"the first line was an apology... It was an 'I'm sorry to put you through this... I love you from the bottom of my heart.'\" Kerry Messer explained that the note reveals \"some conflicts she was going through,\" although he did not explicitly state that there was an intention of suicide in the note.[9] Kerry has since attributed her death to suicide.[8]\nLynn Messer's son, Abram Messer, said that his mother had previously tried to kill herself one time: \"After I asked her several times about it, she said 'I went out to the barn to kill myself, and I shot the cats instead.'\" [9]\nIn the first four days, law enforcement directed the search of the farm and key surrounding areas. From that point, friends and family organized the search parties beyond the farm to try to find Lynn, but all efforts proved unsuccessful. In the months following Lynn's disappearance, over 5,000 acres (2,000\u00a0ha) of land were searched, missing posters were posted in Ste. Genevieve county and its surrounding counties, and a Facebook page was set up in order to try and find her.[4] Police sorted through tips provided by members of the public, including many possible sightings that proved to be mistaken identity, but none of the tips provided any useful leads.\nAs hunting season approached, Kerry created a new not-for-profit educational program, \"Support the Hurting,\" urging hunters, hikers, and other outdoor enthusiasts to be on the lookout for anything suspicious in the woods. His new educational approach was to promote a simple three-step approach to report unusual items which hunters and others might typically ignore. The three-step rule is: \"Don't Touch, Document Location, Report to Local Law Enforcement.\"[4]\nOn November 1, 2016, bones were discovered on the Messer Farm about a mile from the house.[10] They were immediately believed to be the remains of Lynn Messer because of glasses and artificial hips found with them, and shortly afterwards they were positively identified as her by means of dental records.[11]\n",

The move in the highly Democratic African American community was an attempt, as The Washington Post described it, to \"demonstrate that their votes should not be taken for granted.\"[12] He was an integral part of this effort. His leadership connected the community and politicians to move 22,000 Democratic votes to the Republican candidate.[citation needed]\nAfter voting for Barack Obama, Seals became a critic of what he saw as the President's insufficient action on many issues including  police violence and racial profiling.[10]\nSeals was a rapper in St. Louis group D.O.A.; in their song \"Born Targets\", Seals criticized police response to the Ferguson demonstrations.[7]\nSeals was known as \"King D Seals\" on social media, and referred to himself as a \u201cBusinessman, Revolutionary, Activist, Unapologetically BLACK, Afrikan in AmeriKKKa, Fighter, Leader\".[13]\nHe was an outspoken critic of Black Lives Matter.  He used Twitter as a public platform to call out the organization for taking in millions in donations from billionaire sponsor George Soros, and giving nothing back to the Ferguson community where they held protests against the police killing of Michael Brown.[14]  Seals' disapproval was founded in Ferguson's local activist sentiment that the organization hijacked their movement, publicizing it on social media as their own, motivated by personal, political, and financial benefit.  Seals criticism was blunt: \"The only thing #Deray #Netta or #BlackLivesMatter (the org) did in #Ferguson was tweet about our work and collect $\".[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "Palestina Zein \"Tina\" Isa (December 3, 1972 \u2013 November 6, 1989) was an American teenage girl murdered in an honor killing in St. Louis, Missouri by her parents, Zein and Maria Isa.[1] Her death was recorded on audiotape during Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) surveillance on Zein Isa due to his association with the Abu Nidal Organization (ANO). He and his wife were both convicted for first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Zein Isa died of diabetes before he could be executed. Maria Isa was later resentenced to life imprisonment and died in prison.\nPalestina Zein Isa, named after Palestine, was born on December 6, 1972 in Mato Grosso, Brazil.[2] The youngest of seven siblings, she lived in a southern portion of the City of St. Louis in an apartment complex,[3] and attended Dewey Junior High School[4] and Roosevelt High School in Saint Louis. Her father was a Muslim Palestinian, Zein Isa, who originated from Beitin, West Bank.[1] Her mother, Maria Isa, was Brazilian and a Roman Catholic.[1] As a result Tina was of German, Italian, Palestinian, and some indigenous South American descent.[5] She learned Arabic and Portuguese from her parents and Spanish during her time living in Puerto Rico.[6]\nZein al-Abdeen Hassan Isa,[7] born on June 3, 1931, was the third son of a farmer.[8] While a teenager, he married a woman named Foiziya, his double first cousin.[9] In the 1950s, Zein left Palestine,[10] emigrating with members of neighboring families.[8] He first lived in the south of Brazil and, while on a business trip to Rondon\u00f3polis, Mato Grosso, met Maria Matias (born August 10, 1943), a native of Mato Grosso who had been born in Santa Catarina. She was of German, Italian, and South American native descent.[11]\nOn February 6, 1963, the two married despite the opposition of Maria's parents.[12] Zein did not reveal to Maria that she was his second wife until after they had married.[13] They moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in fall 1963, then to Paterson, New Jersey, Arecibo, Puerto Rico, back to Rondon\u00f3polis, then to C\u00e1ceres, Mato Grosso;[14] Tina was born in Mato Grosso.[2]\nThe family moved back to Puerto Rico, living in Arecibo until moving to Isabela one year later. During this time, the father, without the mother, lived with his children in the West Bank for periods of time.[15]\nIn 1980, Zein became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[16] The entire family moved to Beitin in the West Bank when Tina was five.[17] The family came to St. Louis around 1986[16] and owned a grocery store there.[18] Tina began learning English after arriving in St. Louis,[4] where her friends gave her the nickname \"Tina\".[19] In 1991, Tim Bryant of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote in regards to the parents, \"Neither speaks English well.\"[16]\nTina's relationship with her father deteriorated after she turned fourteen; in earlier years they had enjoyed a closer relationship.[20] She listened to American popular music such as hip hop,[1] dance, rap, R&B, and rock.[citation needed] Tina Isa's ambition was to become a pilot after taking aeronautical engineering courses;[3] she intended to do this at Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology (part of St. Louis University).[21] Zein wanted to arrange Tina as a marriage partner to a man from his hometown.[1] Isa's elder sisters stated their dislike of her lifestyle. Her family sent people to extract her from a prom dance she attended.[16] When her family learned that she, since January 1989, was engaged in a romantic relationship with a 20-year-old African-American, Cliff Walker, Tina's parents grew even angrier.\n[22] Zein Isa held grudges against African-Americans because he believed Palestinian businesspeople had been targeted by black criminals.[23]\nPrior to his daughter's murder, Zein made telephone calls stating that Tina had damaged the honor of his family and needed to die. On the day of her death, she worked her first day at a Wendy's fast food restaurant;[22] the family also opposed the idea of her not working for the family's grocery business.[18] Ellen Harris, author of Guarding the Secrets, wrote that \"The problem was that Tina thought of herself as American or hyphenated-American, not as Arab.\"[24]\nHer murder took place at the Delor Park Apartments, in her family's residence.[21] Isa's boyfriend walked her home after the first day of her job. Initially, her parents criticized her for having the outside job and later stated a belief that she was doing something else instead of working. Zein Isa stabbed his daughter with a boning knife. One of her lungs, her liver, and her heart were severely damaged by six blows to her chest. Maria Isa assisted Zein by holding Tina.[22] FBI agents were not at the surveillance unit when the killing happened.[18]\nTina Isa was buried at Sacred Heart Cemetery in Florissant, Missouri, reportedly in a bridal gown. Her Brazilian mother said unmarried girls and women in Brazil who die are buried accordingly. The family intentionally did not provide notice of the funeral to the media to ensure that only people from the family, the local Palestinian community and people from Beitin attended. They expressly did not want Tina's boyfriend to attend. FBI agents secretly monitored and photographed the proceedings.[25]\n",

In 1989 it had about 200 prisoners.[4]\nShortly after the prison's opening, the majority of the non-death row prisoners at Potosi were serving long sentences, such as life imprisonment without parole, or sentences with a 50-year minimum before parole eligibility. A small number had shorter sentences.[5]\nIn April 1989 the state transferred its 70 death row inmates from Jefferson City Correctional Center (JCCC, originally Missouri State Penitentiary[6]) to Potosi. U. S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri approved some modifications to the consent decree before the inmates were moved to Potosi. Originally death row prisoners lived in a 92-bed, two wing facility at PCC. The death row inmates had their own special custody levels: minimum custody, medium custody, close custody, and administrative segregation. One wing housed the minimum custody death row inmates, with another wing housing the others. The classification system was intended to award privileges to death row prisoners exhibiting good behavior. After inmates filed legal challenges, administrators began to consider whether to integrate death row prisoners into the non-death row population, because the majority of non-death row the prisoners at PCC had very long sentences and had committed similar crimes to those committed by death row inmates.[5]\nMDOC began to stop using the word \"death row,\" believing it to be negative, and began referring to death row prisoners as \"\"capital punishment\" (CP) inmates.\"[7] For the first time in MDOC history, the state began to allow death row prisoners to leave their housing units, with staff escorts, to eat meals. When no serious incidents occurred, MDOC officials began to use an escort system so death row prisoners could use the gymnasium. The death row prisoners also began to have access to the law library, and death row prisoners were permitted to work in the laundry facility. On January 8, 1991, death row prisoners were fully mainstreamed into the population.[8]\nSixty-one (61) executions were carried out by lethal injection at the Potosi Correctional Center between 1989 when death row moved to Potosi and 2005 when the site of executions was moved 25 miles (40\u00a0km) east to the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri. Death row prisoners are housed at Potosi until being moved to Bonne Terre shortly before their scheduled execution. Since November 23, 2013, 20 executions have been carried out.[9]\n",

He had confessed to the murder days after it occurred. As a result of a guilty plea, Wilson did not receive a trial by a jury, and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole in 1987. He was incarcerated from 1986 to 1995.[1]\nIn September 1995, Wilson was pardoned by the governor of Missouri, Mel Carnahan, citing that Wilson's confession was coerced, and that there was no evidence tying him to the crime.[2]\nOn April 13, 1986, seventy-nine-year-old Pauline Martz was found dead in her home in Aurora, Missouri. She was beaten, bound and gagged, and left for dead in her house, which had been set ablaze. The authorities also believed that she had been sexually assaulted. An autopsy would reveal that Martz died of carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of the fire. Several days later, the police brought in Johnny Lee Wilson, a mentally challenged twenty-year-old, for interrogation. He was interrogated for over four hours, before confessing to the murder.[1][3]\nWilson was initially connected to the case through an eyewitness, who told police that Wilson revealed implicating information to him at the scene during the fire, though he would recant his statements. Among the evidence against Wilson was women's underwear and jewelry that was found at his residence, which the authorities theorized was taken by him after the murder. However, the items were never confirmed as coming from the Martz home. Wilson was charged with first-degree murder and, in order to avoid the death penalty, pleaded guilty. He received a life sentence without parole.[3][1]\nIn 1988, a man serving time for murder in Kansas, Chris Brownfield, confessed to the murder of Pauline Martz with an accomplice who was not Wilson. He told the authorities that they robbed Martz, and decided to burn the house down due to losing a stun gun that had their fingerprints. However, his confession was deemed unreliable by officials.[4]\nWith the confession from Brownfield, Wilson filed a motion to receive a trial by a jury in June 1989. The judge, David Darnold, denied his motion, citing that Brownfield's confession was not credible. In addition, he also ruled that Wilson was capable of comprehending the charges against him despite his mental condition.[5] In July 1991, the Supreme Court of Missouri denied Wilson's request for a trial by jury, concluding that he understood the guilty plea.[6]\nIn 1993, Wilson requested a pardon from then governor of Missouri Mel Carnahan, which was granted in September 1995 after a year-long investigation of the case. It concluded that there was no physical evidence tying Wilson to the crime, and that the authorities took advantage of Wilson's mental defect to coerce a confession. However, Brownfield has not been prosecuted for the crime, nor anyone else, and the murder of Martz remains unsolved.[7]\nWilson settled with Lawrence County for $615,000 in 2003, after filing a federal lawsuit.[8]\nWilson's case was featured on television programs, Unsolved Mysteries, The Reporters, and Inside Edition.[4][9]\n",

Pillow.[1]\nDuring the early part of the War, Richardson served under Pillow and recruited the 12th Tennessee Cavalry (also known as the 1st Tennessee Partisan Rangers) and was elected that unit's colonel.[2][3] Richardson engaged in the Battle of Shiloh and the Siege of Corinth. He was attached to Forrest's command in the fall of 1863. On December 3, he was appointed brigadier general; however, after being confirmed his nomination was returned by the Confederate Senate at the request of President Jefferson Davis on February 9, 1864. From then to the remainder of the War, his regiment was attached to James R. Chalmers' command.[4]\nA communication from Richardson dated October 28, 1863 at Water Valley, MS indicated the difficult living conditions experienced during the War: \"For God and the country's sake, make your fair promising, but never complying Quartermaster send me skillets, ovens, pots, or anything else that will bake bread or fry meat.  I want clothing, shoes and blankets for my naked and freezing men. . . . I cannot fight any more until I get something to cook in.\"[5]\nAfter the War, Richardson travelled abroad and lived overseas. He returned to Memphis and worked in levee and railroad construction with Forrest. After stopping at a tavern in Clarkton, Missouri, on January 5, 1870, he was shot by an unknown assailant who fired a shotgun at him from behind a wagon in the tavern yard.[6] He died the next day and is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.[7]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nDaniel Charles Shay (born Daniel Shea,[note 1] November 8, 1876 \u2013 December 1, 1927) was an American professional baseball shortstop, manager and scout in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Shay's baseball career was relatively mediocre, and he is probably most remembered for being acquitted in the shooting death of a black man in 1917. \nThe son of Irish immigrants, Shay was born in Springfield, Ohio. He played four seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), for the Cleveland Blues (1901), the St. Louis Cardinals (1904-1905), and the New York Giants (1907). Even during his early baseball career, Shay had several interests outside of playing the game. He owned a cigar shop, several race horses and a minor league baseball team. Shay did not play much after a finger amputation in 1905. He served as a minor league manager between 1908 and 1917.\nWhile managing the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association during the 1917 season, Shay visited a hotel cafe in Indianapolis. He fatally shot black waiter Clarence Euell in an argument stemming from a request for sugar; he claimed self-defense. Race was a contentious issue in the city at that time, and during Shay's nine-day trial for murder, both the prosecutors and defense attorneys attempted to use racial or ethnic stereotypes to their advantage. Shay was acquitted of murder charges. In subsequent media coverage, the verdict was criticized as an injustice.\nAfter being out of the game since his murder trial, Shay was hired as a scout in his last baseball role in 1923. He suffered a stroke and lost the use of his right arm and hand. Ten years after he was acquitted in the murder trial, he was found dead in a hotel room with a gunshot wound to the head. Authorities could not definitively rule out either suicide or murder.\nShay was born in Springfield, Ohio, on November 8, 1876, to Irish immigrants. Around the time of Shay's birth, Springfield was a town characterized by tense race relations. Large numbers of black settlers arrived in the city from Kentucky in the wake of the Civil War. Black residents soon outnumbered whites, and they competed for jobs with working class white citizens like Shay's parents. Schools were integrated in Springfield when Shay was nine years old. He left Springfield by 1895 to begin his career in minor league baseball.[1]\nIn 1897, Shay made his first recorded minor league appearances with three teams in the Interstate League and the Ohio-West Virginia League. Statistics are sparse until 1899, when he hit for a .288 batting average in 100 total games for four minor league teams.[2] While playing minor league baseball for the 1900 Youngstown Little Giants, Shay was fined for leaving the team and for using improper language with the team's manager.[3]\nShay made a brief appearance in the major leagues with the Cleveland Blues in 1901. During the 1902 season, he hit a combined .239 in 167 minor-league games.[2] He was arrested in June 1902 after leaving the St. Paul Saints for another team in San Francisco. He was charged with running up an unpaid bill with St. Paul; he was assessed a $25 fine and agreed to repay $138.[4] Shay played in 193 games for the 1903 San Francisco Seals, registering 721 at-bats and a .243 batting average.[2]\nIn late 1903, a baseball column suggested that the Detroit Tigers were interested in Shay, but he was said to be happy playing in California.[5] During Shay's tenure in San Francisco, he got married.[6] Shay went to spring training with the St. Louis Cardinals before the 1904 season. He impressed the team, prompting speculation that shortstop Dave Brain would move to third base and third baseman Jimmy Burke would serve as a utility infielder.[7] Shay played 99 games for the Cardinals in 1904.[8]\n",

Green's decapitated body was discovered on April 28, 2001, and her head was found nearby on May 1, but remained unidentified until May 5, 2005.[3][4] Green's murder attracted significant media and public attention due to the brutality of the crime and the lengthy period without identification.[7]\nIn 2008, Green's mother and step-father were convicted for her murder.\nOn April 28, 2001, the decapitated body of a young African-American girl was found near Hibbs Park at 59th Street and Kensington Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri. On May 1, 2001, the young girl's head was found wrapped in a trash bag approximately 150 to 200 yards southeast of the body discovery site.[3] Investigators determined that she had been beaten with an ashtray found with the body and kicked several times, causing extensive injuries throughout her body, and then decapitated in an effort to keep police from being able to identify the body. The ashtray lacked DNA or fingerprints, and the unidentified girl was known by the multiple-use name Precious Doe, which was used in public broadcasts in an effort to identify her.\nThe brutality of the crime, and the fact that Green went unidentified for a long period, sparked nationwide interest in an effort to identify her. Police released sketches, computerized facial reconstructions, and at least two busts.[7]\n[8] The case was featured on the TV programs America's Most Wanted and Cold Case Files several times.[9][10][11]\nOn May 5, 2005, Precious Doe was identified as Erica Green, a three-year-old from Oklahoma. Her mother, Michelle Johnson (also known as Michelle Pierce), and her stepfather, Harrell Johnson, were charged with murder and extradited from Oklahoma to face charges in Missouri.[12][13] Michelle Johnson's eight other children were taken into state custody or placed with relatives.[14] On December 3, 2005, prosecutors announced that they would seek the death penalty against Erica's stepfather, Harrell Johnson.[15]\nPolice stated that Erica had died when Johnson had used a pair of hedge clippers to sever her head after she had been brutally beaten.[16] Johnson's cousin, Lawanda Driskell, said that Erica's mother helped Harrell dispose of the body by taking Erica from the house as if sleeping in a stroller and telling Driskell she had given Erica to the woman who had raised her while Johnson was in prison.[16]\nOn October 8, 2008, Harrell Johnson was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.[17] On October 22, 2008, Michelle Johnson was sentenced to 25 years in prison, in exchange for her 2007 guilty plea to second-degree murder and testimony against her husband.[18]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nAnthony Lamar Smith was a 24-year-old African American man from St. Louis, Missouri, who was shot and killed by then St. Louis Police officer Jason Stockley following a car chase on December 20, 2011.[1] On September 15, 2017, Stockley was found not guilty of first-degree murder, and protests erupted in St. Louis.[2]\nSmith was previously convicted for drug distribution and unlawful possession of a firearm, and was out on probation for a theft charge at the time of the incident.[3]  Police officer Stockley and his partner have stated they saw Smith engaged in a drug deal.  Dashcam footage from their police cruiser recorded Smith reversing his car into their vehicle twice before driving off.  A car chase lasting three minutes ensued, ending when Stockley's partner, on Stockley's recommendation, rammed Smith's car.[2]  Stockley was recorded during the chase as saying \"going to kill this motherfucker, don\u2019t you know it\".[1] After the car was stopped, Stockley and his partner, Brian Bianchi, approached Smith's vehicle at West Florissant and Acme Avenues in north St. Louis.[4] Witnesses testified and dashcam footage showed that Stockley yelled at Smith through the driver side window of Smith's vehicle to open the door. Stockley testified that Smith did not comply but rather appeared to be reaching around the interior of his vehicle in search of something which Stockley believed to be a gun. Stockley testified that Smith's demeanor suddenly changed, which Stockley believed indicated that Smith had found the alleged gun. Stockley then opened fire through the window and shot five times, killing Smith. The judge's ruling in subsequent criminal case found that  the \"[a]fter Smith is removed from the Buick, Stockley gets in on the driver's side;...The evidence at trial was that Stockley got into the car to search for a weapon, and Stockley testified that he found a handgun tucked between the seat and center console.\"[5][2]  In 2013 the St. Louis police board settled a wrongful death suit with Smith's survivors for $900,000.[6]\nJason Stockley was charged by St. Louis City prosecutors with first-degree murder in May 2016. He was arrested at his home in Houston, Texas.[7]\nDuring the trial, the prosecution had argued that the revolver found in Smith's car had been planted by Stockley to justify the shooting.  However, in his ruling, St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson said the prosecution's argument was not supported by the evidence.[6]  DNA experts testified that the gun recovered had no trace of Smith's DNA on it, and Stockley's DNA was present.[3][8] The only DNA found on the gun in Smith\u2019s car had a profile similar to Stockley\u2019s, but, as the prosecution said, that does not conclusively prove that Smith did not touch the gun.[8] Judge Wilson stated he found it difficult to believe the gun was concealed and planted by Stockley given the entire incident was on video and Stockley was not wearing a jacket. Wilson also noted Smith's DNA was found on the heroin in the car and that during his 28 years on the bench \"an urban heroin dealer not in possession of a firearm would be an anomaly.\" Before this case, the judge had \"ruled both for and against police during his 28 years on the bench.\" Defense lawyers and prosecutors interviewed by the Associated Press described him as \"objective and well-respected\".[9]\nPrior to the verdict, a group of clergy publicly stated that an acquittal would result in \"mass disruption\" in the city.[10] Missouri Governor Eric Greitens, who was openly critical of his predecessor Jay Nixon's response to the Ferguson unrest, preemptively activated the Missouri National Guard and scheduled 12-hour shifts for the St. Louis Municipal Police.[11]\nOn September 15, 2017 protests erupted when Stockley was found not guilty of murder.[12] Some of the protests turned violent. After declaring the protests an \"unlawful assembly\", police officers were pelted with water bottles and rocks.[13] Protesters also descended upon mayor Lyda Krewson's home, and threw bricks at and vandalized it. Police deployed tear gas to break up the crowd and two officers were injured by bricks thrown by protesters. Over the night, ten police officers were injured and thirty-two protesters were arrested.[13]\nProtesters in attendance reported not hearing an order of dispersal before tear gas, and an estimated 250 people who took shelter in a nearby synagogue described being \"held hostage\" under threat of arrest.[14]\nThe next day, the band U2 and singer Ed Sheeran both cancelled their weekend concerts in St. Louis out of safety concerns over ongoing protests.[15] Protests during this day were largely peaceful, as demonstrators marched through two nearby shopping malls and into the streets.[16] However, a small group of protesters at the Delmar Loop in St. Louis refused to disperse after the police asked them to leave. These protesters broke windows and threw objects at the police, who arrested nine people.[17]\n",

They were convicted of killing five drifters at their farm in Mooresville, Missouri. When her sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1999, Faye Copeland was the oldest woman on death row.\nRay Copeland was born in Oklahoma in 1914. While he was growing up, his family moved around, struggling to survive during the Great Depression.[2][3][4] As a young man, he began a life of petty crime, stealing livestock and forging checks, until he was caught and served a year in jail. After his release in 1940, he met Faye Wilson, and they were married soon afterward. They quickly had several children and, thanks to Ray's criminal reputation, had to keep moving their family around while money was tight.[2][3][4] During this time, Ray served several jail sentences, until he finally came up with a plan to improve his illegal money-making methods so as to be undetected.\nBecause Ray was well known as a fraud, he could not buy and sell cattle on his own. To get around this problem, he began to pick up drifters and hobos and employed them as farmhands on his property in Mooresville, Missouri. He would take his employees to the market, where they would use his bad checks to buy the cattle for him. After the transactions, Ray would sell the cattle quickly and the farmhands would disappear without a trace. For a while, the scam worked, but the police caught up and Ray was once again sent to jail.[2][3][4]\nUpon his release, he resumed his criminal activities, but this time he made sure his farmhands were not as connected to him as before. This went on until a previous employee, Jack McCormick, called the Crime Stoppers hotline in August 1989 to tell them about the Copelands.[2][3][4] McCormick claimed that he had seen human bones on their farm while he was employed there and also claimed that Ray had tried to kill him.\nPolice were initially skeptical of the claims, but after checking Ray's criminal record, they decided to investigate further. In October 1989, they visited the Copeland farm armed with a search warrant, dozens of officers and a team of bloodhounds.[2][3][4] Initially, they did not find any incriminating evidence, but after further searching, the bodies of three young men were discovered in a nearby barn. As the search continued, more bodies were found, all killed with the same weapon: a .22 caliber Marlin rifle that was later found in the Copeland home.[2][3][4]\nIt became clear that Ray killed his employees in the pursuit of money, but Faye's actions were initially questioned. [2][3][4] When she went to trial in November 1990, her defense mounted a picture of her as a dutiful wife and mother who had endured beatings and general ill-treatment from her husband. However, the jury convicted her of five counts of first degree murder. She was given four death sentences for the murders and one life sentence. \nIn March 1991, Ray went on trial, was convicted of five counts of murder and sentenced to death. Upon hearing that Faye had been sentenced to death by lethal injection as well, Ray showed no emotion and replied \"Well, those things happen to some, you know.\"[2][3][4]\nRay died of natural causes on October 19, 1993. His body was cremated. Faye's attorneys appealed her conviction, contending that the jury had not been allowed to hear evidence that Ray had abused her for years. On August 6, 1999, Judge Ortrie Smith overturned the death sentence, but let the convictions stand and commuted her sentence to five consecutive terms of life without parole. \nOn August 10, 2002, Faye suffered a stroke that left her partially paralyzed and unable to speak. Weeks later, in September 2002, Governor Bob Holden authorized a medical parole for Faye, fulfilling her one wish that she not die in prison. She was paroled to a nursing home in her hometown of Chillicothe, Missouri, where she died of natural causes at the age of 82. She left behind five children and 17 grandchildren.\n",

At the time of his arrest, the 32-year-old was an avid recidivist who had spent more than 17 years of his life behind bars. In 1990, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.[1]\nJerry Little was born in 1956 in Marks, Mississippi, into a family of six total children. Four years after his birth, his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where his father soon passed away. He was brought up by his mother. In the late 1960s, due to chronic absences and poor academic performance, Little dropped out of school after graduating from the 6th grade and thereafter began leading a criminal lifestyle. In 1971, he was arrested on rape charges, convicted and sentenced to five years imprisonment by the juvenile court. He was paroled in 1974. A few weeks after his release, Little took part in a robbery and gang rape, for which he was again convicted and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment at the Missouri Eastern Correctional Center. In early 1984, he was paroled again, and Jerry married a girl he had met during his imprisonment. Although he found himself a job and got a house, due to his lack of education, he was forced to engage in low-skilled labor for the next two years. In 1986, he moved to Kansas City, where he was soon arrested for possession of marijuana. Since this was a violation of his parole, he was returned to prison. He was released once again in August 1987, after which he returned to St. Louis, found work at a car wash, and entered a night school for secondary education.[2][3]\nAt the end of July 1988, Little was among the suspects considered in the murders of 28-year-old Imogen Jackson and the 50-year-old Catholic nun Patricia Ann Kelly, who lived in the same apartment building where Little had been living with his wife since 1987. Kelly was raped and strangled on September 27, 1987, in the office of Missouri EnergyCare Inc., a crisis center for the elderly. During the investigation, it turned out that Little was familiar with the victim and appeared at the office shortly before the murder, with circumstantial evidence being that there was no signs of forced entry in the office. Jackson was raped and killed on March 10, 1988, in the apartment building. On August 4, Jerry Little was detained for interrogation. By then, he was also considered a possible suspect for the murder of 60-year-old Rose Jackson, who was strangled on December 19, 1985. Little knew her because Rose was a follower of the Baptist Church, and in the early 1980s, served as an assistant prison chaplain at the institution where he was serving his sentence. Shortly before her murder, Jerry was spotted entering her apartment, but since there was no conclusive evidence found at the crime scene, he was cleared of suspicion. During his interrogation, Little unexpectedly confessed to the murders of the three women, as well as the murder of 48-year-old Doris Orly Hayes, whom he met via night school classes and eventually killed on April 10, 1988. His entire testimony was recorded on video, after which, he was charged.[4][5]\nThe trial began in September 1990. In order to avoid the death penalty, Little and his defense team filed a motion to jointly examine all charges in a single trial, which was upheld. The only evidence that ensured Little's guilt was his own testimony, and during the trial, his lawyers stated that their client had given false testimony under pressure and that he was insane. They requested a forensic examination, but Little refused to pretend being mentally ill during the trial and pleaded guilty, on the basis of which his lawyers' request was rejected. Little's wife, a number of his relatives and acquaintances testified in court as witnesses for the defense. However, in October 1990, Jerry Little was found guilty by jury verdict of the four murders involving rape, and received nine sentences of life imprisonment.[3][6][7]\nIn 1993, Little appealed for the annulment of the sentence and the appointment of a new trial, which was rejected.[6][7] Due to the increase in recidivism among paroled offenders, the state of Missouri passed a law in 1994, on the basis of which criminals sentenced to long terms of imprisonment must serve 85% of the total sentence before being eligible for parole.[8] Little died in 1994 at Central Utah Correctional Facility, Centerfield, Utah.\n",

It is also known as the \"Rocket Queen Riot\".[1]\nDuring the band's performance of \"Rocket Queen\", the fifteenth song in the set (counting drum and guitar solos), singer Axl Rose, in the middle of the chorus, pointed out a fan who was taking still pictures of the show, saying, \"Hey, take that! Take that! Now, get that guy and take that!\" With security unable to confront the person, Rose decided to confiscate the camera himself, saying \"I'll take it, goddamn it!\" and then jumped into the audience and tackled the person. After taking the camera, striking members of the audience and the security team, and being pulled out of the audience by crew members, Rose grabbed his microphone and said \"Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I'm going home!\", slammed his microphone on the stage and left.[2]\nAfter Rose left, guitarist Slash quickly told the audience, \"He just smashed the microphone. We're out of here.\" This infuriated the audience, setting off a three-hour riot in which dozens were injured.[3] The footage was captured by Robert John, who was documenting the tour for the band. Rose was charged with having incited the riot, but police were unable to arrest him until almost a year later, as the band had gone overseas to continue the tour. Charges were filed against Rose but a judge ruled that he did not directly incite the riot.[4]\n\"When something like that happens, you can't help but think back to Donington,\" noted guitarist Izzy Stradlin, referring to the 1988 festival at which two fans died during Guns' set. \"What's to stop us having some more people trampled, because the singer doesn't like something?\"[5]\nRose later stated that the Guns N' Roses security team had made four separate requests to the venue's security staff to remove the camera, each of which were ignored; that members of the band had reported being hit by bottles from the audience; and that the venue's security had allowed weapons into the arena and refused to enforce a drinking limit. Consequently, Use Your Illusion I and II's artwork featured a message in their 'Thank You' notes: \"Fuck You, St. Louis!\"[6]\nThe band did not play in the city again until July 27, 2017, on the Not in This Lifetime... Tour as they had been banned from playing in St. Louis because of the incident.[7]\n",

        "paragraph": "Ann Marie Harrison (February 22, 1974 \u2013 March 22, 1989) was a 15-year-old American girl who was kidnapped, raped, and murdered by two men in Raytown, Missouri. On March 22, 1989, Harrison was abducted from outside her home as she waited for the school bus. She was taken to a house where she was raped by her abductors before being stabbed to death in the trunk of a car.[1][2] Her two killers: Michael Anthony Taylor (January 30, 1967 \u2013 February 26, 2014) and Roderick Nunley (March 10, 1965 \u2013 September 1, 2015) were executed for the crime by the state of Missouri via lethal injection, in 2014 and 2015, respectively.[3][4]\nAnn Marie Harrison was born on February 22, 1974, in Kansas City, Missouri.[5][6] She attended Raytown South High School where she was a freshman honor student.[6]\nOn March 22, 1989, Harrison left her home to go to school and waited for the school bus outside her house. As she waited by the mailbox, a blue '84 Monte Carlo pulled up next to her. Inside the vehicle, which was stolen, were Taylor and Nunley. One of the two men exited the vehicle and asked Harrison for directions. As the man approached her, he pulled her towards him and forced her into the front of the vehicle. The men then sped off with Harrison in the car. A girl waiting for a bus spotted the vehicle speeding past her moments later. Meanwhile, the school bus arrived at Harrison's home and sounded the horn, but no one came. The driver noticed Harrison's books, purse, and flute case had been left by the mailbox. As the bus driver waited and sounded the horn, Harrison's mother came outside to see what was happening. Figuring her daughter was still inside the house, she instructed the bus driver to move on, saying she would drive her to school. After searching the house, Harrison's mother grew concerned when there was no sign of her. She headed to a neighbor's house and then called her husband and the police.[7]\nHarrison was driven to the home of Nunley's mother. Inside the vehicle, the men blindfolded her and threatened to kill her if she continued to scream. After parking in the garage, the two men led Harrison inside and took her to the basement. Both men then took turns raping her. Afterward, the men discussed what to do with her. Not wanting to let her go because she had seen their faces, the men told her to get into the trunk of the vehicle. As Harrison pleaded with them to let her live, both men stabbed her to death with kitchen knives as she lay in the trunk of the car. They then drove the car to a quiet street and left the area in another vehicle. Later on, local media began broadcasting the news of Harrison's disappearance.[7]\nThirty-six hours after Harrison's abduction, a neighbor reported the abandoned blue '84 Monte Carlo. When police checked the license, they learned the vehicle had been stolen. After calling the owner to collect it, he arrived and opened the trunk, discovering Harrison's body.[8] Three months after Harrison's murder, the reward for information leading to the capture of her killers had reached $9,000. A tipster then told police about Taylor and Nunley. When they were brought in, both confessed, but each blamed the other as the instigator of the crime. However, the semen and hair matched Taylor.[7]\nBoth men waived trials and pleaded guilty before a judge.[9] On May 3, 1991, the judge sentenced both men to death.[10]\nIn 1993, the Supreme Court of Missouri overturned the death sentences for Nunley and Taylor without commenting or providing a reason for doing so. Both men were then retried.[11][12]\nOn May 10, 1994, Nunley was sentenced to death for the second time. In addition, the judge sentenced him to life in prison for rape, life in prison for armed criminal action, and fifteen years for kidnapping.[11]\nOn June 17, 1994, Taylor was also sentenced to death for the second time. The judge also sentenced Taylor to life in prison for rape, fifty years for armed criminal action, and fifteen years for kidnapping. The sentences were to run consecutively.[12]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard (n\u00e9e Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield,[2] lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and who had the \"mental capacity of a 7-year-old due to brain damage\" as the result of premature birth.\nAfter reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult and did not have any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.[3]\nFurther investigation found that some of the doctors who had examined Gypsy Rose had found no evidence of the claimed disorders. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nDee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent.[4] Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence;[1] after a brief trial in November 2018, Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[5]\nDee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow.[6] Blanchard was one of five children of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr. and Emma Lois Gisclair.[7]\nRelatives recalled that she had a habit of stealing from her family, which they speculated was a form of retaliation when \"things didn't go her way\".[8] At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse's aide.[3] The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food.[8]\nWhen she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses.[a] Shortly before Gypsy Rose's birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod realized he \"got married for the wrong reasons\". He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.[3]\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder.[3] At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker.[9]\n",

        "paragraph": "Henry Lee Moore (born 1874 in Boone County, Missouri \u2014 unknown) was an American forger, murderer and suspected serial killer who was convicted of killing his mother and grandmother with an axe in their home.[1] While in prison, it was alleged by a Justice Department agent named W. M. McClaughry that Moore was possibly responsible for a string of unsolved axe murders in several states, among them being the Villisca axe Murders.[1]\nBorn and raised in Boone County, Moore lived on the outskirts of Columbia with his mother and grandmother, but worked as a blacksmith's helper at various car shops in Moberly, along the Wabash Railroad.[2] Although described as a friendly-looking man, he had the morbid habit of visiting various morgues in St. Louis with the purpose of looking at the bodies. Not only that, he also collected newspaper scraps from infamous criminal cases, including that of Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen.[3][4]\nMoore communicated with various women through letters,[5] and in May 1910, he was arrested in Wichita, Kansas for forgery. He was convicted and sentenced to a year of imprisonment in the Hutchinson Reformatory,[6] receiving his parole in May 1911.[7]\nSometime after his release, Moore began corresponding with a 16-year-old Columbia girl named Queenie Nichols, eventually professing his love for her.[5] However, Nichols rejected him because he had no home of his own.[4] In response to this, he wrote a letter to her that soon his mother's home would be his, along with all the money in there.[5]\nA day before the murder, Moore travelled by train to Columbia and registered at the Central Hotel under the alias of L. Smith.[5][4] On the night of December 17, 1912, he sneaked into the house carrying a rusty axe with a broken handle which was normally used for handling coal. He crept up behind his 63-year-old mother Georgia, who was sitting in a chair and rubbing herself with an ointment for her joints, and began hitting her on the neck and head.[2]\nAfter killing her, Henry moved on to the bedroom, where his 82-year-old grandmother Mary Wilson was sleeping. Using this as an advantage, he struck her with the axe on the neck and head, killing Wilson before she could make a move to defend herself.[2] Shortly thereafter Henry left the house, disposing of the axe in a nearby ditch.[4] He then returned to his hotel room to clean off the blood, but in his haste left a lot of it on the bedsheets, his clothes and some on his arms.[5]\nThe following day, he pretended to have just arrived and upon \"discovering\" the bodies, he called the neighbors. Police came to the scene, but after investigating Henry's whereabouts he was quickly arrested, as it was quickly revealed that he had stayed in the hotel and blood was found on his clothing and bed sheets for which no explanation was given.[5] Authorities also found an insurance policy in Moore's pocket, but it turned out that it had been on Henry's life, payable to his mother.[2]\nWhile incarcerated, Moore refused to comment on the murders, but talked freely about his character, his poetry and his innocence.[3] According to him, he had just arrived in town from Moberly to celebrate Christmas,[2] and simply happened upon the grisly crime scene. He also denied all the claims made by the newspapers about his nighttime morgue visits, proudly stating that nobody in his family had even been convicted of a crime and that this was his first time in prison.[3]\nUpon further investigation, Prosecuting Attorney E. C. Anderson quickly debunked Moore's explanations, stating that there were witnesses and enough circumstantial evidence to connect him to the killings. He also noted that the accused's claim of being a student at the Kansas State Agricultural College was simply untrue, and concerning his prison sentence, Anderson said that Moore was most likely a drug addict.[6] Despite all of his protestation of innocence, Henry Lee Moore was found guilty of the double murder on March 14, after a four-day trial with 80 jurors present,[8] with the jury giving him a sentence of life imprisonment.[9] His attorney tried to appeal to the Supreme Court, but his request was denied.[9]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nA school shooting is an armed attack at an educational institution, such as a primary school, secondary school, high school or university, involving the use of a firearm. Many school shootings are also categorized as mass shootings due to multiple casualties.[1][2] The phenomenon is most widespread in the United States, which has the highest number of school-related shootings,[3][4] although school shootings have taken place elsewhere in the world.\nAccording to studies, factors behind school shooting include easy access to firearms, family dysfunction, lack of family supervision, and mental illness among many other psychological issues.[citation needed] Among the topmost motives of attackers were: bullying/persecution/threatened (75%) and revenge (61%), while 54% reported having numerous reasons. The remaining motives included an attempt to solve a problem (34%), suicide or depression (27%), and seeking attention or recognition (24%).[5]\nEspecially in the United States, school shootings have sparked a political debate over gun violence, zero tolerance policies, gun rights and gun control.\nThe United States Secret Service published the results from a study regarding 37 school shooting incidents, involving 41 individuals in the United States from December 1974 through May 2000.[6] In a previous report of 18 school shootings by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), they released a profile that described shooters as middle-class, lonely/alienated, awkward, Caucasian males who had access to guns.[7] The most recent report cautioned against the assumption that a perpetrator can be identified by a certain 'type' or profile. The results from the study indicated that perpetrators came from differing backgrounds, making a singular profile difficult when identifying a possible assailant.[6][8] For example, some perpetrators were children of divorce, lived in foster homes, or came from intact nuclear families. The majority of individuals had rarely or never gotten into trouble at school and had a healthy social life. Some, such as Alan Lipman, have warned against the dearth of empirical validity of profiling methods.\nAlmost all perpetrators of school shootings were born male and identified as male at the time of the shooting.\nAccording to Raine (2002), immaturity is one of many identified factors increasing the likelihood of an individual committing criminal acts of violence and outbursts of aggression.[9] This fact is supported by findings on brain development occurring as individuals age from birth.\nAccording to the Australian-based Raising children network and Centre for Adolescent Health (and other sources):[10] the main change occurring in the developing brain during adolescence is the (so-called) pruning of unused connections in thinking and processing. While this is occurring within the brain, retained connections are strengthened. Synaptic pruning occurs because the nervous system in humans develops by firstly, the over-producing of parts of the nervous system, axons, neurons, and synapses, to then later in the development of the nervous system, make the superfluous parts redundant, i.e. pruning (or apoptosis, otherwise known as cell death).[11] These changes occur in certain parts of the brain firstly; the pre-frontal cortex, the brain location where decision-making occurs, is the concluding area for development.\nWhile the pre-frontal cortex is developing, children and teenagers might possibly rely more on the brain part known as the amygdala; involving thinking that is more emotionally active, including aggression and impulsiveness. As a consequence each individual is more likely to want to make riskier choices, and to do so more frequently.[12]\n",

His brother, George Tebeau, was also an MLB player.[1]\nPatsy started his professional baseball career with the Western League's St. Joseph Reds in 1886. The following season, while playing for Denver of the WL, he had a .424 batting average in 94 games.[2] Tebeau made his major league debut with the National League's Chicago White Stockings in September of that year. In 20 games with Chicago, he batted .162.[1] He then played in the Western Association in 1888.[2] In 1889, Tebeau joined the NL's Cleveland Spiders and batted .282.[1] The following year, he was a player-manager for the Cleveland Infants of the Players' League. In 1891, Tebeau returned to the Spiders and was a player-manager for the team until 1898.[3] His lowest batting average with the Spiders was .244 in 1892, and his highest was .329 in 1893.[1] The Spiders never finished a full season in first place in the National League, but Tebeau's team benefited from the season structure in 1892, 1895 and 1896; the 1892 season was a split-season that found Cleveland as the winner of the second half and the right to play in the World's Championship Series (the pre-modern postseason before the World Series). They would compete in the next rendition of postseason play in the League with the Temple Cup that matched the first and second place teams, and Cleveland would win once.[3]\nIn March 1899, the Spiders assigned Tebeau to the St. Louis Perfectos.[1] He managed the team before quitting in the middle of the 1900 season.[4] Tebeau is one of just over a dozen managers to have won at least 400 games in the 19th century.\nIn his 13-year MLB career, Tebeau played 1,167 games and batted .279 with 27 home runs and 735 runs batted in.[1] His managing record was 726\u2013583\u201330.[3] He was known for verbally abusing umpires and opposing players, for which he was criticized by journalists.[4]\nAfter retiring from baseball, Tebeau ran a saloon in St. Louis. His wife left him, and in 1918, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head.[4]\n*Primary team: Cleveland Spiders\n",

The struggle continued until the pistol fired.[4] Johnson said that Wilson initiated a confrontation by grabbing Brown by the neck through Wilson's patrol car window, threatening him and then shooting at him.[5] At this point, both Wilson and Johnson state that Brown and Johnson fled, with Wilson pursuing Brown shortly thereafter. Wilson stated that Brown stopped and charged him after a short pursuit. Johnson contradicted this account, stating that Brown turned around with his hands raised after Wilson shot at his back. According to Johnson, Wilson then shot Brown multiple times until Brown fell to the ground. In the entire altercation, Wilson fired a total of twelve bullets, including twice during the struggle in the car.[6] Brown was struck six times, all in the front of his body.[7][8][9]\nThis event ignited unrest in Ferguson. Witnesses to the shooting claimed Brown had his hands up in surrender or said \"don't shoot\", so protesters later used the slogan \"Hands up, don't shoot\".[10] A subsequent FBI investigation said that there was no evidence that Brown had done so.[11] Protests, both peaceful and violent, continued for more than a week in Ferguson; police later established a nightly curfew.\nThe response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests was strongly criticized by both the media and politicians. Concerns were raised over insensitivity, tactics, and a militarized response. Missouri governor Jay Nixon ordered local police organizations to cede much of their authority to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.\nA grand jury was called and given extensive evidence from Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County Prosecutor. On November 24, 2014, McCulloch announced the St. Louis County grand jury had decided not to indict Wilson.[12] In March 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice reported the conclusion of its own investigation and cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. It found forensic evidence supported Wilson's account, and that witnesses who corroborated the officer's account were credible. Witnesses who had incriminated him were found to be not credible, with some admitting they had not directly seen the events.[13][14] The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Wilson shot Brown in self-defense.[15][16]\nIn 2020, St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell, spent five months reviewing the case with an eye to charge Wilson with either manslaughter or murder.  In July, Bell announced he could not charge Wilson with any crime.[17]\nMichael Orlandus Darrion Brown[18] (May 20, 1996[19] \u2013 August 9, 2014) graduated from Normandy High School in St. Louis County eight days before his death, completing an alternative education program.[20] At the time of his death, he was 18 years old, 6\u00a0feet 4\u00a0inches (1.93 meters) tall, and weighed 292 pounds (132 kilograms).[9] He was an amateur rap musician who posted his songs on the popular music-sharing site SoundCloud under the handle \"Big'Mike.\"[21] He was two days from starting a training program for heating and air conditioning repair at Vatterott College technical school.[22]\nDarren Dean Wilson[23] (born May 14, 1986, in Fort Worth, Texas)[24] was 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m) tall and weighed about 210\u00a0lb (95\u00a0kg).[25][26] Wilson's first police job was in the town of Jennings, Missouri, where he began working in 2009.[26][27] With respect to this job, Wilson said to The New Yorker in 2015, \"I'd never been in an area where there was that much poverty.\"[27] The police force in Jennings was shut down by the town's city council in March 2011.[26] In October 2011, Wilson began working for the Ferguson Police Department.[28] In February 2013, Wilson won a commendation from the Ferguson Police Department after he apprehended a suspect who was later charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and resisting arrest.[28]\nSurveillance video which was publicly released in the 2017 documentary film Stranger Fruit shows Michael Brown walking into Ferguson Market and Liquor at 1:13 a.m., ten-and-a-half hours before he entered the store for the final time. The footage shows Brown handing a young clerk a brown package, believed by the filmmaker to be marijuana, and then receiving an unpurchased package of cigarillos from the store. After the video was rediscovered and made public in 2017, some, including Brown's family, said they believed Brown had left the package there for safekeeping and later returned to retrieve it. The store owner disputed this through an attorney who dismissed claims that the store traded him \"cigarillos for pot.\" The lawyer claimed \"[t]he reason he [Brown] gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they [the staff] wanted it back.\"[29] The store's attorney said the video had been in the hands of Brown's family and law enforcement since the initial investigation, and said the video had been edited to remove the portion where the store clerk returned Brown's package to him.[30] Following this, on March 13, 2017, unedited footage from the store was released by the St. Louis County prosecutor to try to settle questions.[31]\n",

Failing to be reelected, Reynolds and his family moved to Missouri, settling in the Howard County town of Fayette.[2] Thomas Reynolds established a legal practice in Fayette, and for a time also served as editor of the Boonslick Democrat newspaper.[4] Elected to represent Howard County in the Missouri Legislature in 1832, he was quickly named Speaker of the House. In January 1837 Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs nominated Reynolds to be the circuit judge for the 2nd judicial district, a position he held until being elected Missouri's seventh governor in 1840.[3]\nAfter soundly defeating John B. Clark in the 1840 gubernatorial election, Thomas Reynolds presided over a time of great expansion and growth in Missouri. The Oregon Trail, with its kick-off point in western Missouri, was booming and the economy was beginning to recover in the state and nation from the Panic of 1837. A Jacksonian Democrat and follower of Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton, Reynolds generally adhered to their limited-government, hard currency viewpoints.[4] Regarding the issue of slavery Reynolds believed in each state government's right to decide the issue for itself and that abolitionists or others helping enslaved Americans escape should face life imprisonment.[3] Under his leadership fifteen new counties were formed in Missouri. One issue that Reynolds championed perhaps the hardest was for the elimination of debtor's prisons, which the Missouri General Assembly did in February 1843.[4] While he was governor Reynolds worked to improve voting requirements and access. A milestone in education occurred when the first class was enrolled at the University of Missouri.[1]\nDespite all his success Thomas Reynolds was not a well man, either physically or mentally. For several months prior to his death Reynolds was reported in ill health and suffering from melancholia.[2][4] Political opponents in Missouri's Whig party, and certain newspapers under their influence, were particularly harsh in their criticism of Reynolds, his actions and positions as governor.[4] During breakfast on the morning of February 9, 1844 Reynolds asked a blessing, which was not usual for him. Following the meal he locked himself in his Executive Mansion office and drew the shutters closed. Some time later a passer-by heard a shot and upon investigation Reynolds was found dead at his desk with an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.[5] On the governors writing table was a sealed message addressed to his friend, Colonel William G. Minor in which he said \"I have labored and discharged my duties faithfully to the public, but this has not protected me from the slanders and abuse which has rendered my life a burden to me\u2026I pray to God to forgive them and teach them more charity.\"[5]\nA large crowd of mourners attended Governor Reynolds's funeral and burial at Woodlawn Cemetery in Jefferson City, Missouri. Two years later a large granite shaft was erected at his gravesite. Reynolds County, Missouri was also named in his honor.[2] Reynolds's successor, Meredith M. Marmaduke, urged the creation of a system and building for the care of the mentally ill in his 1844 message to the legislature. This helped lead to the opening of Fulton State Hospital in Fulton, Missouri in 1851.[3]\nJoseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon religion, had been in conflict with Reynolds. In a March 10, 1844 sermon, Smith taught that God had promised to give him anything he asked. He stated that he prayed to God to \"deliver me out of the hands of the Governor of Missouri and if it must needs be to accomplish it to take him away[.] [T]he next news that came pouring down...was Governor Reynolds had shot himself,\" [6]\n",

        "paragraph": "The term Know-Nothing Riot has been used to refer to a number of political uprisings of the Nativist American Know Nothing Party in the United States of America during the mid-19th century. These anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic protests culminated into riots in Philadelphia in 1844, St. Louis in 1854, Cincinnati and Louisville in 1855, Baltimore in 1856, Washington, D.C. and New York in 1857, and New Orleans in 1858.\nThe Election Day Riots of 1855 occurred in Cincinnati between April 2-7, 1855. The election was between James J. Faran, the Democratic contender and editor of the Cincinnati Enquirer, and James D. Taylor, rabid nativist editor of the Cincinnati Times. Rumors of illegal voting, ballot-box stuffing, and naturalized voters preventing native-born citizens from voting sparked the events. [1]\nSee Bloody Monday.\nSee Know-Nothing Riots of 1856\nKnow-Nothing associated gang, the Plug Uglies, had travelled to Washington D.C. from Baltimore on June 1, 1857 in an attempt to prevent German and Irish immigrants from voting in the local election. The Plug Uglies linked up with allied members of the Rip Raps and the Chunkers and moved to Mount Vernon Square to harass anti-Know Nothing voters. They then returned to the square armed with pistols, clubs, bricks, and other weapons and charged into the crowd of voters. A brutal fight broke out which the police were unable to stop and by noon, President Buchanan had called out two companies of Marines to stop the riot. By the time the Marines arrived at Mount Vernon Square, the Know-Nothings had set up a barricade and were armed with a cannon they had taken from the Navy Yard. Archibald Henderson, Commandant of the Marine Corps, marched up to the cannon and placed his body in front of it so it could not be aimed at his men. This allowed the Marines to advance on their position, but a fire fight soon broke out. 8 People were killed by the end of the day and many more were injured.[2]\nThe New Orleans Know-Nothing group began as a local movement in 1858 to reduce what residents considered a high rate of crime and violence in the city, primarily among Irish and German immigrants, who were among the poorest classes. A secret Vigilance Committee was formed to monitor their activities, and in particular to prevent disruption of upcoming municipal elections.\nOn the night of June 2, 1858, armed men under the command of Capt. J.K. Duncan, an officer in the United States Army, marched to Jackson Square and occupied the court rooms in The Cabildo. For the next five days, a standoff existed between the Vigilance Committee and members of the Native American Party. On June 7, the elections were held and the Native American candidate, Gerard Stith, defeated the Democratic Party candidate, P.G.T. Beauregard. The Vigilance Committee disbanded with no further violence.[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "The lynching of Francis McIntosh was the killing of a free man of color, a boatman, by a white mob after he was arrested in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 28, 1836.[1] He had fatally stabbed one policeman and injured a second.\nFrancis L. McIntosh, aged twenty-six,[2] of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was a free man of color who worked as a porter and a cook on the steamboat Flora, which arrived in St. Louis on April 28.[3] McIntosh departed the boat in the morning to visit an African-American chambermaid who worked aboard the Lady Jackson, which had docked the same day.[3]\nAccording to the captain of the Flora, as McIntosh departed the boat, two police officers were chasing another sailor (who had been involved in a fight) and requested McIntosh's assistance in stopping him.[3] McIntosh did not assist the officers, and he was arrested for interfering in the apprehension.[3] In the second version of events, the two sailors had been drinking and had insulted the officers, and McIntosh refused to assist in arresting the pair.[3] According to St. Louis: An Informal History of the City and Its People, Deputy Constable William Mull arrested McIntosh the afternoon of the 28th for helping two Flora deckhands escape from Mull's custody. On their way to jail, the two met George Hammond, deputy sheriff, who assisted Mull in escorting McIntosh to jail.[4]\nWhen charged with breach of the peace by a justice of the peace, McIntosh asked the two arresting officers how long he would have to remain in jail.[3] After one told him that he would serve five years in prison for the crime, McIntosh stabbed both officers, killing one and seriously injuring the other, and tried to escape.[1][3] He fled down Market Street to Walnut, scaled a garden fence, and hid in an outhouse. A man in the crowd that had gathered outside smashed in the door, knocked down McIntosh, and took his knife. The crowd took McIntosh to jail, where Sheriff James Brotherton locked him up.[4]\nA white mob soon broke into the jail and removed McIntosh.[1] The mob took him to the outskirts of town (near the present-day intersection of Seventh and Chestnut streets in Downtown St. Louis), chained him to a locust tree, and piled wood around and up to his knees.[1] When the mob lit the wood with a hot brand, McIntosh asked the crowd to shoot him, and began to sing hymns.[3] When one in the crowd said that he had died, McIntosh reportedly replied, \"No, no \u2014 I feel as much as any of you. Shoot me! Shoot me!\"[3] After at most twenty minutes, McIntosh died.[3]\nEstimates for the number of persons present at the lynching range in the hundreds, and include an alderman who threatened to shoot anyone who attempted to stop the killing.[5] During the night, an elderly African-American man was paid to keep the fire lit, and the mob dispersed.[3] The next day, on April 29, a group of boys were seen throwing rocks at McIntosh's corpse in an attempt to break his skull.[3]\nWhen a grand jury was convened on May 16 to investigate the lynching, it was overseen by Judge Luke E. Lawless. Most local newspapers and the presiding judge encouraged no indictment for the crime, and no one was ever charged or convicted.[5][6] Judge Lawless stated in his charge to the jury that if individuals could be found guilty, they should be prosecuted. However, he suggested no judicial action if this was a mass phenomenon.[7] The judge also remarked in court that McIntosh's actions were an example of the \"atrocities committed in this and other states by individuals of negro blood against their white brethren,\" and that with the rise of abolitionism, \"the free negro has been converted into a deadly enemy.\"[5][8] The judge mistakenly told the jury that McIntosh was a pawn of local abolitionists, particularly Elijah Lovejoy, the publisher of a known abolitionist newspaper. Many in the East and St. Louis itself condemned Judge Lawless's actions during the trial.[7]\nIn the weeks after the lynching, several abolitionists condemned the events, including newspaper editor Elijah Lovejoy.[3][9] Lovejoy ran the Presbyterian religious newspaper, St. Louis Observer. He published abolitionist, temperance, and anti-Catholic editorials. The Observer header on May 5, 1836 suggested that the lynching of McIntosh effectively ended the rule of Law and Constitution in St. Louis.[7]\nAs a result of mob pressure and outright attacks on his press, Lovejoy was forced to move from St. Louis to Alton, Illinois, in the free state. But in November 1837, after he had acquired and hidden a new press, a white anti-abolition mob attacked the warehouse where it was stored. He was fatally shot and killed in the altercation, as was a man named Bishop in the mob.[5]\n",

He was the longest-lived, as well as the last surviving member of the gang.\nBorn into a staunchly religious family in Missouri, his two brothers became preachers. However, Daugherty rebelled and left Missouri for Oklahoma Territory at only 14 years of age. He called himself \"Arkansas Tom Jones\", claiming to have been from there. For several years, he worked as a cowboy, which was how he met Bill Doolin. He joined Doolin's gang around 1892. He was involved in several robberies, but was one of the first of the gang to fall, being captured after the Battle of Ingalls, in Ingalls, Oklahoma on September 1, 1893. He killed Deputy Marshal Thomas Hueston during that shootout,[1] and was captured after Deputy Marshal Jim Masterson threw dynamite into where Jones was making his stand, stunning him. Deputy Marshal Hueston, whom Jones killed, along with Ford County, Kansas Sheriff Chalkey Beeson had killed Wild Bunch gang member Oliver Yantis the year before.\nDaugherty was sentenced to fifty years in prison, but due to his two preacher brothers campaigning on his behalf, he was paroled in 1910. For two years he ran a restaurant in Drumright, Oklahoma, but became bored and moved to Hollywood, California, hoping to act in western films. However, that did not work out, and he committed a bank robbery in 1917 in Neosho, Missouri, and was again captured. Released in 1921, he robbed another bank in Asbury, Missouri that same year. He remained on the run from law enforcement until tracked to Joplin, Missouri and killed during a gunfight by Joplin Police Detective Leonard H. \"Len\" Vandeventer on August 16, 1924.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "Vernon Brown (October 1, 1953 \u2013 May 18, 2005) was an American murderer, child molester, and suspected serial killer who was convicted for the murders of a young woman and a young girl in St. Louis, Missouri in 1985 and 1986, but is suspected of committing at least two other murders, including being a prime suspect for the murder of the St. Louis Jane Doe.[1] Brown was sentenced to death and executed in 2005 for the two murders he was convicted of, having never confessed responsibility for any other murders.[2]\nVernon Brown was born on October 1, 1953, in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of five children born to different fathers.[3] His mother was 15 at the time of his birth and the identity of Brown's father has never been established, with some speculating that he might have been the product of an incestuous relationship between his mother and his grandfather.[4] Brown was reportedly physically and sexually abused in his youth, and supposedly suffered a head injury that caused him to have memory lapses. As a child, he was considered aloof, but was protective of his younger siblings and friends whenever they got into trouble.[3]\nBrown dropped out of high school at age 16 and attempted to enlist in the Army two years later, but was rejected for unclear reasons. In 1973, he was convicted of sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl in Indianapolis and served 4 years of a 5-year prison sentence.[3][5] After his release, he drifted around the country and worked odd jobs until he eventually settled in St. Louis, Missouri, where he married a homeless woman.[3] A few years later, while still married to his first wife, Brown married yet again to another woman under the alias Thomas \"Tommy\" Turner. To support himself, he worked as a maintenance man at 4000 Enright Avenue, an area that was marred with crime and frequented by prostitutes and drug users. At around this time, Brown himself started using a variety of drugs, most notably PCP.[4]\nOn March 7, 1985, the body of 18-year-old Synetta Ford was found in her apartment on 3500 Washington Boulevard, having been stabbed in the throat with a butcher knife and thereafter strangled. Upon interviewing her roommate, police learned that Ford had been frightened by the maintenance man working on the building, whom she knew as Tommy Turner, but in actuality was Brown.[6] When questioned, Brown claimed that on the night of the murder he had seen a Cuban man quickly leaving the area, but as this statement sounded dubious, he was ordered to undergo a polygraph test which he subsequently failed.[7] Now considered a suspect, the police questioned his wife, who revealed that Brown had confessed the killing to her, providing intricate details that only the real killer would know - for example, he said that she had been strangled with an electrical cord, which was not mentioned in the media. Because of this, an arrest warrant was issued for him, but the charges had to be dropped due to a statute in Missouri law that prevented a spouse's testimony in court, even if the testimony was given willingly.[7]\nAfter his release, Brown moved in with 31-year-old Kathy Moore, a single mother who lived on Enright Avenue together with her three sons: 11-year-old Tommy Johnson, 9-year-old Christopher, and 7-year-old Jason Moore. After he moved in with them, he continued using drugs, sometimes taking multiple in a day, and would frequently rape each of his stepsons by making them perform anal and oral sex.[8] On the afternoon of October 24, 1986, Brown was sitting on the front porch when he spotted 9-year-old Janet Perkins, who was on her way home from school, and called her to come visit him. When she entered, he ordered his stepsons to go to their rooms and lock the doors while he lured the girl to the basement, where he subsequently strangled her with a rope.[9] Brown then wrapped Perkins' body in trash bags and dumped them inside a container in an alley behind his house, where they were subsequently found by a passerby.[10]\nSoon after Perkins' body was found, police started combing the area and questioning everybody living in the neighborhood, until a witness came forward and claimed that they had last seen the girl entering Brown's house.[11][6] They then went and questioned Brown, who surprisingly admitted to the crime, claiming that he had smoked cigarettes laced with PCP and then blacked out during the killing. Furthermore, police discovered that he was actually on the run from police in Indiana, where he had been charged with robbery and six counts of child molestation relating to attacks on a 7-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy.[6]\nAfter the arrest of a suspect was announced in the media, an outcry of support poured out from across the city, with the leader of a student support group even organizing a march to protest the violence that had been going on in the area.[12] In due time, it was also revealed that Brown had previously been arrested for a similar violent murder just the year prior, leading to the FBI submitting a special report into ViCAP in an attempt to possibly link him to any further crimes.[13] This further investigation led to Brown being charged with the rape-murder of 9-year-old Kimberly K. Campbell, whose nude and battered body was found in a vacant house in Indianapolis on August 27, 1980.[14] In addition, he was considered a possible suspect in further murders in both states, but the most well-known of these was the murder of the St. Louis Jane Doe, a yet-unidentified young girl who had been found raped, strangled and decapitated in St. Louis on February 28, 1983.[14]\nBrown was initially also suspected of the rape-slaying of 15-year-old Tracey Poindexter in 1985. However, in 2001, DNA evidence linked another man named Sterling Riggs to the crime. Riggs was convicted of murder and sentenced to 115 years in prison.[15] On appeal, he won a new trial and eventually had his sentence reduced to 50 years.[16] Riggs was released from prison in 2021.[17]\nBrown was first put on trial for the murder of Perkins, which began in October 1988. At said trial, his three stepsons were called in and retold what their stepfather had told them to do on the night of the murder, and not long after, they heard Janet's screams through a bedroom vent.[9] Brown himself admitted to the crime in a videotaped statement, which was played to the jurors at his trial - however, he notably omitted the fact that he had told his stepsons to lock themselves up and continued to claim that he had blacked out during the crime.[10] After only two hours of deliberation, the jurors returned a guilty verdict on first degree murder, in spite of Brown's lawyer attempting to convince them to hand down a lesser charge of second degree murder. Upon hearing the verdict, Brown simply stood with his hands behind his back and looked with a blank expression on his face.[18] A few days later, after taking into account various aggravating factors in the case, the jury recommended the death sentence, which was subsequently handed down to Brown.[8]\n",

They were convicted of killing five drifters at their farm in Mooresville, Missouri. When her sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1999, Faye Copeland was the oldest woman on death row.\nRay Copeland was born in Oklahoma in 1914. While he was growing up, his family moved around, struggling to survive during the Great Depression.[2][3][4] As a young man, he began a life of petty crime, stealing livestock and forging checks, until he was caught and served a year in jail. After his release in 1940, he met Faye Wilson, and they were married soon afterward. They quickly had several children and, thanks to Ray's criminal reputation, had to keep moving their family around while money was tight.[2][3][4] During this time, Ray served several jail sentences, until he finally came up with a plan to improve his illegal money-making methods so as to be undetected.\nBecause Ray was well known as a fraud, he could not buy and sell cattle on his own. To get around this problem, he began to pick up drifters and hobos and employed them as farmhands on his property in Mooresville, Missouri. He would take his employees to the market, where they would use his bad checks to buy the cattle for him. After the transactions, Ray would sell the cattle quickly and the farmhands would disappear without a trace. For a while, the scam worked, but the police caught up and Ray was once again sent to jail.[2][3][4]\nUpon his release, he resumed his criminal activities, but this time he made sure his farmhands were not as connected to him as before. This went on until a previous employee, Jack McCormick, called the Crime Stoppers hotline in August 1989 to tell them about the Copelands.[2][3][4] McCormick claimed that he had seen human bones on their farm while he was employed there and also claimed that Ray had tried to kill him.\nPolice were initially skeptical of the claims, but after checking Ray's criminal record, they decided to investigate further. In October 1989, they visited the Copeland farm armed with a search warrant, dozens of officers and a team of bloodhounds.[2][3][4] Initially, they did not find any incriminating evidence, but after further searching, the bodies of three young men were discovered in a nearby barn. As the search continued, more bodies were found, all killed with the same weapon: a .22 caliber Marlin rifle that was later found in the Copeland home.[2][3][4]\nIt became clear that Ray killed his employees in the pursuit of money, but Faye's actions were initially questioned. [2][3][4] When she went to trial in November 1990, her defense mounted a picture of her as a dutiful wife and mother who had endured beatings and general ill-treatment from her husband. However, the jury convicted her of five counts of first degree murder. She was given four death sentences for the murders and one life sentence. \nIn March 1991, Ray went on trial, was convicted of five counts of murder and sentenced to death. Upon hearing that Faye had been sentenced to death by lethal injection as well, Ray showed no emotion and replied \"Well, those things happen to some, you know.\"[2][3][4]\nRay died of natural causes on October 19, 1993. His body was cremated. Faye's attorneys appealed her conviction, contending that the jury had not been allowed to hear evidence that Ray had abused her for years. On August 6, 1999, Judge Ortrie Smith overturned the death sentence, but let the convictions stand and commuted her sentence to five consecutive terms of life without parole. \nOn August 10, 2002, Faye suffered a stroke that left her partially paralyzed and unable to speak. Weeks later, in September 2002, Governor Bob Holden authorized a medical parole for Faye, fulfilling her one wish that she not die in prison. She was paroled to a nursing home in her hometown of Chillicothe, Missouri, where she died of natural causes at the age of 82. She left behind five children and 17 grandchildren.\n",

Bolton.[1]  During his time serving the United Nations delegation, he helped the delegation uncover the Oil for Food Scandal, a scheme by Saddam Hussein to circumvent United Nations sanctions using bribery and kickbacks to U .N. and other officials.[6]\nIn 2005, Schweich became the second-highest ranking and then highest-ranking international law enforcement official in the U.S. State Department as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and Acting Assistant Secretary of State at the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.[6]  He directed four thousand people located in dozens of countries with a budget of more than 2.5 billion dollars.[1]  He was subsequently appointed Coordinator for Counternarcotics and Justice Reform in Afghanistan and was accorded the rank of Ambassador by President George W. Bush.[6]\nIn 2010, Schweich sought and won the Republican nomination for Missouri State Auditor, defeating Missouri State Representative Allen Icet with 58.6% of the vote.[13]\nIn the general election, he faced incumbent and Democratic nominee Susan Montee.[13]  Schweich defeated Montee on November 2, 2010, with a 51% to 45% margin of victory.[3]\n",

His surname is often misspelled as Liddel, Liddell, or Liddle.\nLiddil was born to James Milton Liddil and Elizabeth Forsby in Jackson County, Missouri in 1852.[1] In the mid-1870s, Liddil was arrested for horse stealing in Vernon County, Missouri.[1]\nAfter being pardoned by the Governor of Missouri, Liddil was introduced to Jesse James in 1879.[1] Liddil joined the James Gang that year and was later described by Frank James as a \"good industrious young chap.\"[1]\nLiddil rode with the James Gang in October 1879 when they raided a depot in Glendale, 15 miles east of Kansas City.[1][2] After capturing the telegraph operator, the gang signaled a train to stop, stealing the money from the safe in the express car. Liddil later said he received slightly over $1,000 for his part in the raid.[1]\nAccording to Liddil's later account, he became engaged to Mattie Collins the day after the Glendale raid. Liddil had met Collins in 1878 while she was on trial for murdering her employer.  After Collins was acquitted on grounds of emotional insanity, Liddil introduced himself.[1]\nBy some accounts, Liddil served as the lookout in September 1880 when the James Gang robbed the John Dovey Coal Mine payroll in Mercer County, Kentucky.[1]  Liddil reportedly had a love of horses and attended the horse races with Jesse James at Nashville's Blood Horse Race Course in October 1880.\nLiddil was also part of the James Gang during its 1881 robberies of a paymaster delivering money to workers on the Muscle Shoals Canal project in Alabama, and a July 1881 robbery of the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad at Winston, Missouri.\nIn November 1881, Liddil and Wood Hite, a first cousin of the James brothers, became engaged in a shootout outside Adairville, Kentucky, though neither man was shot. Liddil and Bob Ford killed Hite later that year, and Liddil was wounded in the fight.[1][3] After killing Hite, Liddil hid, worrying that Jesse James would seek revenge for the death of his cousin. Liddil later recalled, \"I mistrusted [him, and believed] Jesse wanted to kill me.\"[3]\nIn January 1882, Liddil and Robert Ford surrendered to Sheriff James Timberlake at Martha Bolton's residence in Clay County, Missouri, reportedly out of fear of what Jesse James would do to him for killing Hite.[1][2] Liddil told the law what he knew about the criminal activities of the James Gang, and his capture and confession were kept secret until March 1882.[1][3]\n",

He was charged with petty theft of a bicycle in Harrisburg at age six in 1951; became engaged in voyeurism and exhibitionism at age 13, in 1958; and was again charged with petty theft in New Milford, Pennsylvania at age 15, in 1960.[6]\nTimothy McBride was legally adopted by his stepfather, Bernie Krajcir, and his surname legally changed from McBride to Krajcir in 1953.[6] At the age of 10, Timothy Krajcir began to develop an unhealthy sexual and emotional obsession with his mother.[6]\nKrajcir later enrolled at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, where he earned a BA in the administration of justice with a minor in psychology.[7]\nHe enrolled in the U.S. Navy at age 17, in 1962, and participated in basic training in Great Lakes, Illinois. He was dishonorably discharged for sexual assault in 1963 after fourteen months of service.[3]\nKrajcir first entered the Illinois prison system in 1963 on a rape conviction.  Since then, he has spent most of his adult life behind bars for sex crimes, except for a brief period of freedom in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this brief period, he killed at least nine women. Krajcir has been incarcerated since 1982.[4]\nIn Spring 1983, at age 38, he was arrested in Allentown, Pennsylvania after police found him in his car, holding a pistol, which was a violation of his parole terms. On May 3, 1983, he attempted a failed escape from prison in Allentown, breaking his leg in the process.[6] Later that year, he was tried and convicted for indecent assaults, robbery, criminal trespassing and sentenced to 2 1/2 years to 5 years in Pennsylvania prison. He served five years in Graterford State Prison in Skippack Township, Pennsylvania. Following completion of his Pennsylvania sentence  in 1988 at age 43, he was moved to Big Muddy River Correctional Center in Ina, Illinois to complete sentencing terms for parole violations and violating his prior conditional release terms.[6] There, he chose to remain in prison, saying he did not wish to hurt anyone. He also ceased attempting to convince officials that he wished to change his criminal ways, and he stopped attending prison therapy sessions. He remained in prison for nearly 20 years, from the age of 42 to 62.[6]\nIn carrying out his crimes, Krajcir would travel to various towns that he had no connection to, stalk his victims, and then break into their homes and wait for them to arrive.[8] In 1977, Krajcir was released from prison after serving time for rape, and as a condition of his parole, he was required to enroll at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. There, in 1981, he earned a degree in Administrative Justice with a minor in psychology.[9]\n",

Ahmad Adisa, age 27, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole.[3] At his trial, evidence suggested that Adisa was hired to kill Lathon for a $10,000 payment, though no one else has been charged in the case. Assistant Circuit Attorney Dwight Warren told jurors that Lathon was killed in retaliation for his suspected involvement in the kidnapping and torture of a drug dealer in 1999.

Originally sentenced to 35 years imprisonment for a 1979 second-degree murder charge, he was later paroled and, with the help of two accomplices, embarked on a crime spree that resulted in the deaths of at least four more people. Convicted and sentenced to death for one of these murders, he and one of his accomplices were executed in 2009 and 2013, respectively.\nOn December 2, 1979, the 20-year-old Skillicorn accompanied two other men \u2013 28-year-old James K. Betts and 21-year-old Elias Frank Brooks Jr. \u2013 on an out-of-town trip to buy drugs. In desperate need of cash, they decided to rob somebody, setting their sights on a rural farmhouse in Levasy. The trio broke in and forced the occupant, 81-year-old Wendell Howell, to stay on the couch while Brooks and Skillicorn stole his TV set. When they did so, Betts proceeded to shoot him in the back of the head with a sawed-off shotgun.[1]\nShortly after fleeing the crime scene, the criminals were stopped by a policeman in Buckner for a routine vehicle inspection, and despite the fact that he found it odd that they had a TV in the back seat, he let them go.[2] Later on, when the officer learned that a homicide had recently been committed in the area, he contacted law enforcement about the traffic stop and identified the trio when he was presented with their photographs. As a result, Betts, Brooks, and Skillicorn were all arrested and charged with the robbery-murder of Wendell Howell.[2] For his part in the crime, Skillicorn testified against Betts and was eventually convicted of second-degree murder, for which he was given 35 years imprisonment with a chance of parole.[1]\nAfter serving 13 years and a half of his sentence, Skillicorn was paroled in November 1992 and returned to live in Kansas City, but was required to enroll himself into a drug rehabilitation center ran by The Salvation Army. During his time there, he befriended a man named Allen L. Nicklasson, a 22-year-old violent felon and fellow drug addict. In late August 1994, the pair, accompanied by 17-year-old Tim DeGraffenreid, decided to go buy drugs together after leaving the rehabilitation center and got in DeGraffenreid's 1983 Chevrolet Caprice, whereupon they headed towards St. Louis.[3]\nAlong the way, their car broke down near Kingdom City, and after having trouble starting it for a day, they then broke into a nearby house to steal money and guns. They then paid to have the car fixed, but it had too many issues and eventually broke down again near Kingdom City on August 24.[4] While they were attempting to fix it, the trio were approached by 47-year-old Richard Drummond, a supervisor for AT&T from Excelsior Springs who offered to help them out. Nicklasson then held him at gunpoint and ordered him to go into the car, where the three men drove away in his 1994 Dodge Intrepid. Along the way, Skillicorn and Nicklasson decided to get rid of Drummond, driving to a field near Higginsville, where Nicklasson shot Drummond in the back of the head.[3] The trio then attended a party in Blue Springs, and after that, DeGraffenreid left them and went into hiding, while Skillicorn and Nicklasson pressed on.[4]\nFrom there, the pair drove southwest, finding themselves in Kingman, Arizona two days later. After getting their car stuck, Skillicorn and Nicklasson knocked on the door of the nearest house, occupied by Joseph and Charlene Babcock.[3] Explaining their situation, Joseph agreed to help them and drove the two men back to their car in his own 1989 Dodge Ramcharger. Once they arrived, he was shot dead, but as they were unwilling to leave any potential witnesses, Skillicorn and Nicklasson got into Joseph's car and drove back to his house, burst inside, and knocked Charlene to the ground. They then shot her in the head, ransacked a nearby house for ammunition, and fled in the Babcocks' car. Later in the evening, a man resembling Skillicorn attempted to snatch a woman's purse in Huntington Beach, California, and when confronted by her and another passer-by, he opened fire on them. The victims were unharmed, but the assailant jumped into his car \u2013 a Ramcharger with Arizona license plates \u2013 and sped away from the scene.[3]\nThey were then traced to Battle Mountain, Nevada, where a man resembling Skillicorn was seen on August 31. The day after, a Ramcharger was seen speeding away from the area in what was later discovered to be a murder scene \u2013 the victim was a trucker from Missouri named Paul James Hines, who had been transporting candy bars across the I-80.[5] Like the pair's previous victims, he had been shot to death. By this time, Skillicorn and Nicklasson were sought after by several states and the FBI, as DeGraffenreid (who had been arrested by then) had revealed the location of Drummond's body and implicated them as the main killers.[6] As authorities no clue as to their whereabouts after this, people across the southwestern United States were warned to be wary of helping anybody asking for help on highways.[7]\nAfter spending the remainder of September in hiding, including at least ten days in Mexico, Skillicorn and Nicklasson eventually ran out of money. They then drove to San Diego, where they turned to hitchhiking along interstate ramps. On October 5, while hitchhiking with another man, Nicklasson was arrested by a police officer and transported to the county jail \u2013 however, Skillicorn was not recognized at the time and was let go along with the man accompanying them. His freedom did not last long, as he was re-arrested by California Highway Patrol officers on the following day.[8] Following brief interrogations, both men reportedly confessed to killing Drummond and the Babcocks.[9] As it was expected that both of them were likely to face the death penalty, a federal carjacking charge was dropped, allowing extradition proceedings back to Kansas City to continue.[10] In response to the initial failure to arrest Skillicorn, a hearing was held at the United States Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs to discuss what measures should be taken to expand criminal background checks.[11]\n",

On March 22, 1989, Harrison was abducted from outside her home as she waited for the school bus. She was taken to a house where she was raped by her abductors before being stabbed to death in the trunk of a car.[1][2] Her two killers: Michael Anthony Taylor (January 30, 1967 \u2013 February 26, 2014) and Roderick Nunley (March 10, 1965 \u2013 September 1, 2015) were executed for the crime by the state of Missouri via lethal injection, in 2014 and 2015, respectively.[3][4]\nAnn Marie Harrison was born on February 22, 1974, in Kansas City, Missouri.[5][6] She attended Raytown South High School where she was a freshman honor student.[6]\nOn March 22, 1989, Harrison left her home to go to school and waited for the school bus outside her house. As she waited by the mailbox, a blue '84 Monte Carlo pulled up next to her. Inside the vehicle, which was stolen, were Taylor and Nunley. One of the two men exited the vehicle and asked Harrison for directions. As the man approached her, he pulled her towards him and forced her into the front of the vehicle. The men then sped off with Harrison in the car. A girl waiting for a bus spotted the vehicle speeding past her moments later. Meanwhile, the school bus arrived at Harrison's home and sounded the horn, but no one came. The driver noticed Harrison's books, purse, and flute case had been left by the mailbox. As the bus driver waited and sounded the horn, Harrison's mother came outside to see what was happening. Figuring her daughter was still inside the house, she instructed the bus driver to move on, saying she would drive her to school. After searching the house, Harrison's mother grew concerned when there was no sign of her. She headed to a neighbor's house and then called her husband and the police.[7]\nHarrison was driven to the home of Nunley's mother. Inside the vehicle, the men blindfolded her and threatened to kill her if she continued to scream. After parking in the garage, the two men led Harrison inside and took her to the basement. Both men then took turns raping her. Afterward, the men discussed what to do with her. Not wanting to let her go because she had seen their faces, the men told her to get into the trunk of the vehicle. As Harrison pleaded with them to let her live, both men stabbed her to death with kitchen knives as she lay in the trunk of the car. They then drove the car to a quiet street and left the area in another vehicle. Later on, local media began broadcasting the news of Harrison's disappearance.[7]\nThirty-six hours after Harrison's abduction, a neighbor reported the abandoned blue '84 Monte Carlo. When police checked the license, they learned the vehicle had been stolen. After calling the owner to collect it, he arrived and opened the trunk, discovering Harrison's body.[8] Three months after Harrison's murder, the reward for information leading to the capture of her killers had reached $9,000. A tipster then told police about Taylor and Nunley. When they were brought in, both confessed, but each blamed the other as the instigator of the crime. However, the semen and hair matched Taylor.[7]\nBoth men waived trials and pleaded guilty before a judge.[9] On May 3, 1991, the judge sentenced both men to death.[10]\nIn 1993, the Supreme Court of Missouri overturned the death sentences for Nunley and Taylor without commenting or providing a reason for doing so. Both men were then retried.[11][12]\nOn May 10, 1994, Nunley was sentenced to death for the second time. In addition, the judge sentenced him to life in prison for rape, life in prison for armed criminal action, and fifteen years for kidnapping.[11]\nOn June 17, 1994, Taylor was also sentenced to death for the second time. The judge also sentenced Taylor to life in prison for rape, fifty years for armed criminal action, and fifteen years for kidnapping. The sentences were to run consecutively.[12]\n",

He is referred to twice in the Church of Jesus Christ's Doctrine and Covenants\u2014once in section 114 and posthumously in section 124.\nPatten was born to Benoni and Edith Cole Patten in Vermont, and moved to Theresa, New York, as a young child.[1][2] He was the 11th of 13 children. He was around 6'1\" and of a dark complexion.[3] As a youth, Patten moved to the town of Dundee in eastern Michigan.[4]:\u200a1\u200a While there, at the age of 28 he married Phoebe Ann Babcock in 1828.[5] The two had one stillborn child; they had no children live to adulthood.[4]:\u200a1\u200a [6] Patten allied himself with the local Methodist congregation during this time, all the while professing a belief that there was \"no true religion on the earth.\"[1]\nIn 1830, Patten heard about the publication of the Book of Mormon. He became \"greatly agitated in mind and desired to see it.\" That summer, he had the opportunity to read the preface and the Testimony of the Three Witnesses that was attached to the book. Two years later, Patten learned that his brother John had recently joined the Church of Christ (the original name of the church founded by Joseph Smith). Excited, David rode three\u00a0hundred\u00a0miles to his brother's house in Fairplay, Indiana, to investigate the church.[4]:\u200a3\u200a On June 15, 1832, Patten was baptized by his brother.[7]\nPatten served several short missions for the church, and was one of the first missionaries to visit the southern United States.[3] Two days after his baptism, Patten was ordained an elder by Elisha H. Groves, and soon after sent on a mission to Michigan Territory.[6][7] On this trip, he was accompanied by another recent convert, Joseph Wood. Together, the two traveled for 23 days without much food or money, instead relying on nearby families for sustenance and a place to sleep. This assignment lasted \"a short season,\" during which time Patten baptized his wife. Healing was a distinctive feature of Patten's missionary labors. Abraham O. Smoot said that \"he never knew an instance in which David's petition for the sick was not answered.\"[1] Patten described some accounts of his healing: \"Jesus called upon me to lay hands on [Brother] Coltrain who accidentally burned his hand and he received no harm. Brother William Smith had a pain in his eye and I laid my hand on him in the name of Jesus Christ and the pain left him.\"[4]\nPatten was ordained a high priest by Hyrum Smith on September 2, 1832.[4]:\u200a4\u20137\u200a\nAt the end of 1832, several missionaries, including Patten, were sent to states on the east coast in response to a revelation received by Joseph Smith in September of the same year. Over the next few months, Patten traveled with other missionaries, including John Murdock, William Smith, Zebedee Coltrin, John F. Boynton, Hyrum Smith, and Reynolds Cahoon.[4]:\u200a12\u200a Patten began preaching in Ohio and made his way to Pennsylvania, and then to New York and back to Kirtland, Ohio, the headquarters of the church. He returned home on February 15, 1833, and within a month was called on his third mission, this time to preach near Theresa, New York, where his mother and some of his siblings lived.[4]:\u200a13\u201320\u200a Patten left on March 25, 1833, accompanied by Reynolds Cahoon. During their journey, the two visited congregations of church members along the way and advised them to move to Kirtland. During one of these visits, a heckler interrupted a meeting in Avon, New York, ridiculing the missionaries and refusing to be quiet. Patten told him to be quiet or he would \"put him out\", to which the heckler responded, \"You can't do it.\" Patten answered \"In the name of the Lord, I will\" and picked the man up with both hands, took him to the back door, and reportedly threw him ten feet into a wood pile. This story became a popular tale for early members of the church.[4]:\u200a23\u201324\u200a\nPatten was known to sing using the gift of Tongues. On February 27, 1833 Sidney Rigdon interpreted a song of Patten's and transcribed it into Revelation Book 2. [8] They hymn was about Enoch's vision as found in Joseph Smith's revision of Genesis. The interpreted hymn was mailed to Independence, MO where W.W. Phelps published it, unattributed, in the May 1833 edition of the Evening and Morning Star. Sometime before publication the text was adapted into a song with meter and rhyming. [9] The original hymn was never published.\nBy May 1833, Patten and his companion had arrived at Theresa. They stayed their first night there at the house of Patten's brother Archibald. After remaining in Theresa and preaching for a few weeks, on May 20, 1833, Patten's mother was baptized by Brigham Young, as were two of Patten's brothers, Ira and Archibald, and two sisters, Polly and Betsy. After a while, Patten traveled south to Henderson, New York, where he preached and converted eighty\u00a0people. After that, Patten returned to Kirtland. In the time following his mission, he worked on constructing the Kirtland Temple and moved his family from Michigan to Ohio.[4]:\u200a22\u201331\u200a\nAltogether, Patten served twelve short missions for the church in the eastern United States in 1832 and 1833 and in Tennessee with Warren Parrish in 1834.[5] During this time, he was persecuted by mobs while establishing numerous branches of the church.[7]\n",

        "paragraph": "Mary McElroy (November 25, 1907 \u2013 January 21, 1940) was an American kidnapping victim. She was the daughter of Henry F. 'Judge' McElroy, City Manager of Kansas City, Missouri.\nTwenty-five-year-old McElroy was kidnapped while taking a bubble bath in her father's home on the evening of May\u00a027, 1933.[1][2] Her abductors were brothers George and Walter McGee, Clarence Click, and Clarence Stevens. Walter McGee, a divorced ex-con from Oregon, was the gang leader. McGee and Stevens donned masks, forced their way into the house with a sawed-off shotgun, and allowed McElroy time to dry herself and get dressed. She apparently did not take them very seriously; when told that $60,000 was going to be demanded in exchange for her release, she joked \"I'm worth more than that!\"[3]\nMcElroy was taken to a farmhouse in Shawnee, Kansas owned by Click,[4] where she was chained to a wall in the basement. After demanding the original sum of $60,000, the kidnappers settled for $30,000, which Judge McElroy paid on May\u00a029.[5] Mary McElroy was released unharmed near the Millburn Golf Course[6] after twenty-nine hours in captivity. George McGee and Clarence Click were apprehended some time before June\u00a021.[7][8] Walter McGee was arrested in Amarillo, Texas on June\u00a02 after attempting to purchase a car with some of the ransom money.[9][8] Of the original sum, about $9,000 was recovered from McGee's person.[10] About $16,000 of the original ransom was recovered.[7]\nThe kidnapping and subsequent trial were a media sensation. The trial took place in Jefferson City. According to reports, McElroy evinced crippling shame and embarrassment when questioned. She related that Walter McGee had ordered her to strip naked before releasing her so that they could be sure she was not smuggling evidence; she refused and they did not force her. She also displayed difficulty in identifying her abductors in court when called to do so.[11] She insisted that she had been well treated and had even been given flowers by Walter before her release.[8] During the trial, McElroy met with relatives of her kidnappers and publicly expressed sympathy for them.[10]\nSuffering a nervous breakdown on February 10, she disappeared from her father's home, surfacing a day later in Illinois after sending her father a telegram from Springfield which read: \"Sorry but I am so frightened. I don't know what I'm doing.\"[12] She was found in Normal and brought back to Missouri where she explained her irrational departure to the authorities: \"I felt like a murderer... I wanted to getaway. I couldn't stand sitting still.\"[9] Because he had masterminded the kidnapping, Walter McGee was given the harshest sentence. On March 30, 1935, his sentence, death by hanging, was announced; had it occurred, McGee would have been the first person to be executed for kidnapping in the United States.[6]\nAfter an execution date was set for May 10, Mary McElroy shocked everyone by contesting the penalty. In April 1935, she wrote to Governor Guy Brasfield Park: \"Walter McGee's sentence has hung as heavily over me as over him. Through punishing a guilty man, his victim will be made to suffer equally... In pleading for Walter McGee's life I am pleading for my own peace of mind.\"[13] McGee was granted a stay of execution by Park on May 7;[14] McElroy's father publicly backed her plea for this stay of execution.[15] His sentence was eventually commuted to life in prison.\nThe abduction and the subsequent fallout proved to be extremely traumatic for Mary McElroy, and she suffered several 'nervous collapses' in her years after the case.[4] She lived with her father, Judge McElroy for most of her adult life. His death in 1939 devastated her, and she became increasingly reclusive.[16]\nOn January 21, 1940, her maid discovered McElroy's body in her bedroom; she had committed suicide, shooting herself in the head with a small pistol. She left a suicide note which read: \"My four kidnappers are probably the four people on earth who don't consider me an utter fool. You have your death penalty now - so - please - give them a chance. Mary.\"[17] McElroy was 32. At the time of her death, Walter and George McGee (34 and 29 respectively) were still in prison, Clarence Click had been released in 1938, and Clarence Stevens was still at large.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "On June 5, 1904, thousands of people rioted in St. Louis, Missouri just north of the 1904 World's Fair after a bullfight was canceled by court order. The St. Louis bullfight riot resulted in a handful of injuries and the complete destruction (by fire) of the Norris Amusement Company arena. The riot disrupted the World's Fair for one day, and one bullfighter murdered another shortly after the riot, an action indirectly attributed to the incident.\nThe riot took place after a promoter named Richard Norris began advertising that he would stage bullfights June 5, 1904, capitalizing on the international spirit engendered by the World's Fair. He built a 16,000 seat arena, naming it after himself, and signed Spanish bullfighter Manuel Cervera Prieto and 35 others to extended contracts.[1] Bullfighting was illegal in the United States and the state of Missouri,[2] and animal rights activists urged Missouri governor Alexander Monroe Dockery to halt the fight. The St. Louis Humane Society pleaded with the governor to \"avert this flagrant outrage upon the civilization of the State of Missouri and of the United States.\"[3] The humane society was joined by religious organizations including the Congregational State Association of Missouri, and under their pressure, Dockery acquiesced. One day before the fight, he ordered the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney to arrest all violators of the state's anti-bullfighting law.[4]\nDespite the controversy, Norris sold more than 8,000 tickets at $1 apiece to the bullfight. With the World's Fair closed on Sunday (the day of the fight), Norris hired members of the fair's Wild West show to begin the bullfight with a demonstration of horsemanship. This was followed by a lacrosse demonstration, but the crowd began to become agitated with the wait for the bullfight.[1] Just as the arena's announcer began to introduce Cervera, a deputy sheriff stepped into the arena and told the announcer the fight was not permitted. The deputy and other officers took the organizers to the company's office to settle the matter, but the agitated crowd began throwing rocks through the windows of the office adjacent to the arena after they learned there would be no refunds for the show.[5]\nDuring the fracas, a man standing on the porch of the company office and demanding a refund was struck by a rock and injured. Others inside the office were injured by broken glass. The mob was deterred from storming the building by police with drawn pistols, but there were not enough officers to keep the mob from moving instead to the arena grandstand.[6] Once in the arena, the mob released three emaciated bulls found nearby. The condition of the bulls and their lack of aggression caused many in the crowd to believe the show was a scam and no fight was actually intended. Some in the mob set straw afire in the bullpen, and the flames quickly spread to the grandstand, which was built of highly flammable pine and tar paper.[6]\nDespite the efforts of police and firefighters (who responded from the nearby World's Fairgrounds), the arena burned to the ground. Several members of the mob were subsequently arrested for arson.[6] Two days after the riot, Cervera was killed by fellow bullfighter Carleton Bass as the two fought over payments from the aborted fight. The bullfighters subsequently asserted that the Norris management never intended to host the bullfight.[7]\nCoordinates: 38\u00b039\u2032N 90\u00b018\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff38.65\u00b0N 90.30\u00b0W\ufeff / 38.65; -90.30\n",

        "paragraph": "Hurt Hardy, Jr. (November 4, 1904[1] \u2013 February 26, 1937) was one of the last people to be executed by hanging in Missouri. While his execution is often cited as \"the last public execution in the United States,\" that distinction actually went to Rainey Bethea, who was hanged in Kentucky on August 14, 1936.\nHurt Hardy was convicted of the murder of Ethel Fahnestock, with whom he was \"very much in love,\" according to one of his appeals after his death sentence.  Fahnestock did not reciprocate his affections and wished to sever ties with Hardy, and Hardy refused to accept that Fahnestock was not interested in him, determining that \"the only way out was to take [his] own life and take her with [him]\".[2] His motive was rooted in jealousy and possessiveness; he did not wish to see her with any other men, considering that she had rejected him.[3]\nTherefore, Hardy hatched a plan to lie in wait for Fahnestock. She had a morning chore of milking cows for her family, and Hardy waited several mornings for her to do so and to be alone so he could kill her. One morning, Hardy determined that Fahnestock was at too far of a distance for him to strike. The next morning, Fahnestock was accompanied by her younger brother, and Hardy did not wish to hurt Ethel in the presence of her brother.[2] Finally, on September 28, 1935,[4] Hardy found Fahnestock alone, sitting on a stool and milking the family cows. He approached her and shot her. The first shot did not seriously injure Fahnestock and she tried to escape, so he shot her twice more. The last two shots proved to be fatal.[2]\nHardy attempted to make a guilty plea to the crime of murder to avoid a trial by jury. The court rejected the plea and directed him to enter a plea of not guilty. This required him to have a jury trial.[2]\nAt trial, medical testimony revealed that Hardy was suffering from a severe case of syphilis at the time that he murdered Ethel Fahnestock. He tried to use his sickness in his defense, arguing that he \"wasn\u2019t all there\"[3] because he suffered from the severest degree of the disease. The defense failed, and on November 8, 1935, Hardy was convicted of first-degree murder. Exactly one week later, on November 15, he was formally sentenced to death.[2]\nAfter several failed appeals, Hurt Hardy's execution was scheduled for February 26, 1937. It ultimately took place on that date in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. Hardy's execution is often cited as the \"last public execution in the United States\" since the execution that usually earns that distinction, that of Rainey Bethea in Owensboro, Kentucky, took place in August 1936. However, Hardy's execution was not actually public at all, as images of the hanging show that officials built a 16-foot tall[3] wooden enclosure around the gallows on which Hardy was hanged.[5] Public executions are those which can be viewed by anybody who wishes to do so. The purpose of the enclosure was to ensure that only those authorized to view the execution would be present.[6]\nEven though Hardy's execution was not formally public, between 200 and 400 people witnessed it anyway after gaining unauthorized access into the enclosure. There were a further 500 people crowded outside of the walled enclosure in which Hardy was executed who were not permitted entry, \"barred from witnessing\" the hanging.[5] Presiding over the execution was renowned hangman G. Phil Hanna, who very frequently assisted with and supervised hangings, especially in the midwest, in the 1920s and 1930s. Interestingly, he had also been asked to supervise the hanging of Rainey Bethea.[6]\nI am proud to be fully prepared to meet my Maker, and I will be happy to meet my sweetheart in the beyond. That's all.By the time Hardy was executed, most states had moved away from executions being carried out in individual counties, and Missouri would very soon follow suit. Hurt Hardy was not the last person to be executed by hanging in an individual county in Missouri, however. Three more men would die on county gallows in the state - Fred Adams on April 2, 1937; Roscoe Jackson on May 21, 1937; and Dudley Barr on May 21, 1937[7] - before Missouri lawmakers would pass legislation in September of the same year[8] to replace hanging with the gas chamber. The private gas chamber would be permanently housed in the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City, and the state would use its gas chamber for all executions from 1938 to 1965.\n",

As a result of this killing, several of John's brothers joined Quantrill's Raiders, but John and his younger brother Bob were too young to join so they stayed at home to look after their mother and sisters.\nIn January 1866, Bob and John took their mother to Independence, Missouri, to purchase winter supplies. Recognizing the family from his military days an ex-soldier named Gillcreas [2] came up to the wagon and made some comments about Cole. John told him to be quiet and the soldier slapped him around the face with a frozen fish. John got out his brother's pistol (Cole's that they had taken to be repaired) and shot him between the eyes.[citation needed]\nAfter an examination of the body it was revealed the soldier was carrying a heavy slingshot that still was tied to his wrist, so the killing was ruled as self-defense.\nThe Youngers headed to Texas for a peaceful life[citation needed] until illness fell on Bersheba so the boys (with the exception of Cole) took her back to Missouri to die.\nAs soon as they arrived they were harassed, Bob was knocked unconscious, and John was hung four times,[3] and the fourth time they hung him the rope dug deep into his flesh.[4] They cut him down and hacked at the body with knives.[5] He survived. Witnessing this was too much for Bersheba[citation needed] and she died on June 6, 1870, her 54th birthday.\nAfter Bersheba's funeral John and Bob met up with Jim and, because it was not safe to stay in one place,[citation needed] they often moved between Missouri and Texas.\n",

Green's decapitated body was discovered on April 28, 2001, and her head was found nearby on May 1, but remained unidentified until May 5, 2005.[3][4] Green's murder attracted significant media and public attention due to the brutality of the crime and the lengthy period without identification.[7]\nIn 2008, Green's mother and step-father were convicted for her murder.\nOn April 28, 2001, the decapitated body of a young African-American girl was found near Hibbs Park at 59th Street and Kensington Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri.

The ashtray lacked DNA or fingerprints, and the unidentified girl was known by the multiple-use name Precious Doe, which was used in public broadcasts in an effort to identify her.\nThe brutality of the crime, and the fact that Green went unidentified for a long period, sparked nationwide interest in an effort to identify her.

Anderson[a] (c. 1840\u00a0\u2013 October 26, 1864), known by the nickname \"Bloody Bill\" Anderson, was a soldier who was one of the deadliest and most notorious Confederate guerrilla leaders in the American Civil War. Anderson led a band of volunteer partisan raiders who targeted Union loyalists and federal soldiers in the states of Missouri and Kansas. \nRaised by a family of Southerners in Kansas, Anderson began to support himself by stealing and selling horses in 1862. After a former friend and secessionist turned Union loyalist judge killed his father, Anderson killed the judge and fled to Missouri.[1] There he robbed travelers and killed several Union soldiers. In early 1863 he joined Quantrill's Raiders, a group of Confederate guerrillas which operated along the Kansas\u2013Missouri border. He became a skilled bushwhacker, earning the trust of the group's leaders, William Quantrill and George M. Todd. Anderson's bushwhacking marked him as a dangerous man and eventually led the Union to imprison his sisters. After a building collapse in the makeshift jail in Kansas City, Missouri, left one of them dead in custody and the other permanently maimed, Anderson devoted himself to revenge. He took a leading role in the Lawrence Massacre and later took part in the Battle of Baxter Springs, both in 1863.\nIn late 1863, while Quantrill's Raiders spent the winter in Sherman, Texas, animosity developed between Anderson and Quantrill. Anderson, perhaps falsely, implicated Quantrill in a murder, leading to the latter's arrest by Confederate authorities. Anderson subsequently returned to Missouri as the leader of his own group of raiders and became the most feared guerrilla in the state, robbing and killing a large number of Union soldiers and civilian sympathizers. Although Union supporters viewed him as incorrigibly evil, Confederate supporters in Missouri saw his actions as justifiable. In September 1864, Anderson led a raid on the town of Centralia, Missouri. Unexpectedly, his men were able to capture a passenger train, the first time Confederate guerrillas had done so. In what became known as the Centralia Massacre, Anderson's bushwhackers killed 24 unarmed Union soldiers on the train and set an ambush later that day which killed over a hundred Union militiamen. Anderson himself was killed a month later in battle. Historians have made disparate appraisals of Anderson; some see him as a sadistic, psychopathic killer, while others put his actions into the perspective of the general desperation and lawlessness of the time and the brutalization effect of war.\nWilliam T. Anderson was born around 1840 in Hopkins County, Kentucky, to William C. and Martha Anderson.[2] His siblings were Jim, Ellis, Mary Ellen, Josephine and Janie.[3] His schoolmates recalled him as a well-behaved, reserved child.[2] During his childhood, Anderson's family moved to Huntsville, Missouri, where his father found employment on a farm and the family became well-respected.[4] In 1857, they relocated to the Kansas Territory, traveling southwest on the Santa Fe Trail and settling 13 miles (21\u00a0km) east of Council Grove.[5] The Anderson family supported slavery, though they did not own slaves. Their move to Kansas was likely for economic rather than political reasons.[6] Kansas was at the time embroiled in an ideological conflict regarding its admission to the Union as slave or free, and both pro-slavery activists and abolitionists had moved there in attempts to influence its ultimate status.[7][b] Animosity and violence between the two sides quickly developed in what was called Bleeding Kansas, but there was little unrest in the Council Grove area.[8] After settling there, the Anderson family became friends with A.I. Baker, a local judge who was a Confederate sympathizer.[1] By 1860, the young William T. Anderson was a joint owner of a 320-acre (1.3\u00a0km2) property that was worth $500;[c] his family had a total net worth of around $1,000.[9][d] On June 28, 1860, William's mother, Martha Anderson, died after being struck by lightning.[10]\nIn the late 1850s, Ellis Anderson fled to Iowa after killing a native American. Around the same time, William T. Anderson fatally shot a member of the Kaw tribe outside Council Grove; he claimed that the man had tried to rob him.[11] He joined the freight shipping operation for which his father worked and was given a position known as \"second boss\" for a wagon trip to New Mexico. The trip was not successful and he returned to Missouri without the shipment, saying his horses had disappeared with the cargo. After he returned to Council Grove he began horse trading, taking horses from towns in Kansas, transporting them to Missouri and returning with more horses.[10]\nAfter the Civil War began in 1861, the demand for horses increased and Anderson transitioned from trading horses to stealing them, reselling them as far away as New Mexico. He worked with his brother Jim, their friend Lee Griffith and several accomplices strung along the Santa Fe Trail.[12] In late 1861, Anderson traveled south with Jim and Judge Baker in an apparent attempt to join the Confederate Army.[13] Anderson had told a neighbor that he sought to fight for financial reasons rather than out of loyalty to the Confederacy.[14] However, the group was attacked by the Union's 6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry in Vernon County, Missouri;[e] the cavalry likely assumed they were Confederate guerrillas.[15] The Anderson brothers escaped, but Baker was captured and spent four months in prison before returning to Kansas, professing loyalty to the Union. One way he sought to prove that loyalty was by severing his ties with Anderson's sister Mary, his former lover.[13]\nUpon his return to Kansas, Anderson continued horse trafficking, but ranchers in the area soon became aware of his operations.[16] In May 1862, Judge Baker issued an arrest warrant for Griffith, whom Anderson helped hide. Some local citizens suspected the Anderson family was assisting Griffith and traveled to their house to confront the elder William Anderson. After hearing their accusations against his sons, he was incensed\u2014he found Baker's involvement particularly infuriating. The next day, the elder Anderson traveled to the Council Grove courthouse with a gun, intending to force Baker to withdraw the warrant. As he entered the building he was restrained by a constable and fatally shot by Baker. The younger Anderson buried his father[17] and was subsequently arrested for assisting Griffith. However, he was quickly released owing to a problem with the warrant, and fled to Agnes City, fearing he would be lynched. There he met Baker, who temporarily placated him by providing a lawyer. Anderson remained in Agnes City until he learned that Baker would not be charged, as the judge's claim of self-defense had been accepted by legal authorities. Anderson was outraged and went to Missouri with his siblings. William and Jim Anderson then traveled southwest of Kansas City, robbing travelers to support themselves.[18]\nOn July 2, 1862, William and Jim Anderson returned to Council Grove and sent an accomplice to Baker's house claiming to be a traveler seeking supplies.[19] Baker and his brother-in-law brought the man to a store, where they were ambushed by the Anderson brothers. After a brief gunfight, Baker and his brother-in-law fled into the store's basement. The Andersons barricaded the door to the basement and set the store on fire, killing Baker and his brother-in-law. They also burnt Baker's home and stole two of his horses before returning to Missouri on the Santa Fe Trail.[20]\n",

        "paragraph": "Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that struck down the police practice of first obtaining an inadmissible confession without giving Miranda warnings, then issuing the warnings, and then obtaining a second confession.  Justice David Souter announced the judgment of the Court and wrote for a plurality of four justices that the second confession was admissible only if the intermediate Miranda warnings were \"effective enough to accomplish their object.\"  Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in a concurring opinion that the second confession should be inadmissible only if \"the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.\"\nPatrice Seibert, a suspect in a fatal arson, was arrested and taken to the police station.  There, a police officer decided to interrogate her using a method he had been taught: to question the suspect, obtain a confession, then give Miranda warnings and repeat the questioning until the confession was obtained again.  Accordingly, Seibert was not informed of her Miranda rights before the interrogation began.  After about 40 minutes of questioning, Seibert made an incriminating statement.  She was given a 20-minute break.  When the questioning resumed, she was given her Miranda warnings, and reminded of what she had admitted before the break.  She then repeated her confession.\nThe trial court (Missouri Circuit Court) suppressed the first statement because it was given before the Miranda warnings, but admitted the second.  Seibert was convicted of second-degree murder.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split among the Circuit Courts of Appeal on this issue.\nSouter, writing for the plurality, focused on the actual effectiveness of Miranda warnings given after an earlier unwarned confession.  Just giving the warnings is not necessarily good enough.  Instead, a court must ask, \"Could the warnings effectively advise the suspect that he had a real choice about giving an admissible statement at that juncture?  Could they reasonably convey that he could choose to stop talking even if he had talked earlier?\"\nThe plurality opinion gives some guidance on when an intermediate warning should be considered to be effective.  Such a warning is likely to mislead a defendant about his rights when it is made \"in the midst of coordinated and continuing interrogation.\"  Courts should therefore consider \"the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping content of the two statements, the timing and setting of the first and the second, the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogator's questions treated the second round as continuous with the first.\"\nJustice Breyer concurred.  He set forth a different test for whether the second confession should be admissible: \"Courts should exclude the 'fruit' of the initial unwarned questioning unless the failure to warn was in good faith.\"  The term \"fruit\" refers to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, which provides that in criminal trials, courts may not admit evidence obtained as an indirect result of a search that violated the Fourth Amendment.  Justice Breyer's proposed rule would extend that doctrine to evidence obtained as an indirect result of an interrogation that violated the Fifth Amendment.  Although this test was different from Justice Souter's, Breyer also joined with the Souter's plurality opinion because he thought that the two tests would yield the same result in practice.\nJustice Kennedy also concurred, and proposed yet another test.  He wrote that he \"would apply a narrower test applicable only in the infrequent case, such as we have here, in which the two-step interrogation technique was used in a calculated way to undermine the Miranda warning.\"  If a two-step procedure was deliberately used, the subsequent statement would be inadmissible unless the police \"cured\" the problem by taking measures that would enable the suspect to distinguish the first interrogation from the second \"and appreciate that the interrogation has taken a new turn.\"  Kennedy suggested that a long break between the two interrogations would usually be sufficient, as would an explanation to the suspect that the first statement would probably be inadmissible in court.\nJustice O'Connor wrote for the dissent.  She criticized the majority for not being faithful to the Court's earlier opinions involving two-stage interrogations, especially Oregon v. Elstad, a 1985 case involving a two-stage interrogation.  The dissent stated that under the precedent of Elstad, it did not matter whether the police failed to give Miranda warnings before the first confession, so long as the confession was not coerced.  Even if the first confession were coerced, \"the court must examine whether the taint dissipated through the passing of time or a change in circumstances.\" To make that determination, O'Connor would have courts look to many of the same factual considerations identified by the plurality: \"the time that passes between confessions, the change in place of interrogations, and the change in identity of the interrogators.\"\nThe dissent would thus have allowed police to continue to use the question-first, warn-later approach, so long as they could show that the first confession was voluntary and that the \"taint\" of the first confession had worn off.\n",

He also confessed to the attempted murders of magazine publisher and pornographer Larry Flynt in 1978 and civil rights activist Vernon Jordan in 1980. Both survived their injuries, but Flynt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down. Franklin was not convicted in either of those highly publicized cases, and he made his confessions years after the crimes had occurred.\nFranklin was on Missouri's death row for 15 years awaiting execution for the 1977 murder of Gerald Gordon.[2][3] He was executed by lethal injection on November 20, 2013.[4]\nJames Clayton Vaughn Jr. was born in Mobile, Alabama, on April 13, 1950, the elder son of James Clayton Vaughn Sr. and Helen Rau Vaughn, and brother to Carolyn, Marilyn, and Gordon.[5] Vaughn's father was a World War II veteran and butcher who left the family when Vaughn was aged eight.[6] His sister Carolyn recalled, \"Whenever [Vaughn Sr.] came to visit he'd beat us,\" and their mother had Vaughn Sr. jailed twice for public drunkenness. Vaughn's mother was described by a family friend as \"a full-blooded German, a real strict, perfectionist lady. I never saw her beat any of [her children], but they told me stories.\"[6]\nVaughn later stated that he was rarely given enough to eat and suffered severe physical abuse as a child,[7] and that his mother \"didn't care about [him and his siblings]\".[8] He claimed that these factors stunted his emotional development, and said he had \"always been least ten years or more behind other people in their maturity.\"[8]\nAs early as high school, Vaughn developed an interest in evangelical Christianity, then in Nazism, and later held memberships in both the National Socialist White People's Party and the Ku Klux Klan. He eventually changed his name to \"Joseph Paul Franklin\" in honor of Paul Joseph Goebbels and Benjamin Franklin.[9] In the 1960s, Franklin was inspired to start a race war after reading Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. \"I've never felt that way about any other book that I read,\" he later reflected. \"It was something weird about that book.\"[10]\nIn the early 1970s, he took a road trip to an American Nazi Party conference in Virginia with David Duke (then a student) and Don Black.[11]\nFor much of his life, Franklin was a drifter, roaming the East Coast seeking chances to \"cleanse the world\" of people he considered inferior, especially black people and Jewish people.[7] His primary source of financial support appears to have been bank robberies. Franklin supplemented his income from criminal acts with paid blood bank donations, which eventually led to his subsequent capture by the FBI.[12]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Ferguson unrest (sometimes called the Ferguson uprising, Ferguson protests, or the Ferguson riots) were a series of protests and riots which began in Ferguson, Missouri on August 10, 2014, the day after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. The unrest sparked a vigorous debate in the United States about the relationship between law enforcement officers and African Americans, the militarization of police, and the use-of-force law in Missouri and nationwide. Continuing activism expanded the issues by including modern-day debtors prisons,[9] for-profit policing,[10] and school segregation.[11]\nAs the details of the shooting emerged, police established curfews and deployed riot squads in an attempt to maintain order. Along with peaceful protests, there was a significant amount of looting and violent unrest in the vicinity of the site of the shooting, as well as across the city. There was also a significant amount of media criticism of the militarization of the police when it dealt with protests in Ferguson.[12][13] The unrest continued on November 24, 2014, after a grand jury did not indict Officer Wilson.[14] It briefly continued again on the first anniversary of Brown's shooting.[15] The Department of Justice (DOJ) concluded Wilson shot Brown in self-defense.[16][17]\nIn response to the shooting and the subsequent unrest, the DOJ conducted an investigation into the policing practices of the Ferguson Police Department (FPD).[18][19] In March 2015, the DOJ announced that they had determined that the FPD had engaged in misconduct against the citizenry of Ferguson by, among other things, discriminating against African Americans and applying racial stereotypes in a \"pattern or practice of unlawful conduct.\"[20][21][22] The DOJ also found that Ferguson depended on fines and other charges generated by police.[23]\nMichael Brown, an 18-year-old African-American male, was shot and killed during an encounter with Officer Darren Wilson.  Officer Wilson arrived after a robbery and assault was reported at a nearby convenience store. The caller described the accused (later identified as Michael Brown from security cameras). Officer Wilson's account was that after seeing Brown and Brown's friend Dorian Johnson walking home in the middle of the street he asked them to walk on the sidewalk instead. When they refused Wilson noticed that Brown's shirt and a box of cigarillos he was holding matched the description from the robbery call, and suspected Brown and Johnson as being involved. When he attempted to question Michael Brown, he was attacked.[24] There was a struggle, Brown attempting and almost succeeding in gaining possession of Officer Wilson's weapon. Due to the struggle, the weapon discharged, slightly wounding Brown, who then fled. Wilson gave brief chase firing upon Brown, ultimately shooting and killing Brown when Brown turned to confront him and, upon Wilson's account, charged at him. The officer was a 28-year-old white male Ferguson police officer.[25][26][27] After several months of deliberation, a grand jury decided not to indict Officer Wilson for any criminal charges in relation to the incident.[28]\nThe police response to the shooting was heavily criticized, as was the slow rate of information making its way out to the public.  Many of the documents received and reviewed by the Grand Jury were released when the grand jury declined to indict Officer Wilson.[28]\nOn August 9, the evening of the shooting, residents had created a makeshift memorial of flowers and candles in the spot where Brown died. According to Mother Jones, an unidentified policeman allowed their dog to urinate on the memorial and police vehicles later crushed the memorial. Mother Jones reported that these incidents inflamed tensions among bystanders, according to Missourian state representative Sharon Pace, who told the reporters for the magazine, \"That made people in the crowd mad and it made me mad.\"[29]\nOn August 10, a day of memorials began peacefully, but some people became outspoken after an evening candlelight vigil.[30] Local police stations assembled approximately 150 officers in riot gear.[31] Some people began looting businesses, vandalizing vehicles, and confronting police officers who sought to block off access to several areas of the city.[30] At least 12 businesses were looted or vandalized and a QuikTrip convenience store and gas station was set on fire, as well as a Little Caesars. The Quiktrip looting was captured on video by activist Umar Lee[32] leading to over 30 arrests. Many windows were broken and several nearby businesses closed on Monday.[33] The people arrested face charges of assault, burglary, and theft. Police used a variety of equipment, including riot gear and helicopters, to disperse the crowd by 2:00\u00a0a.m.[34] Two police officers suffered minor injuries during the events.[35]\nOn August 11, police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd at the burnt shell of the QuikTrip[34] convenience store, set on fire by looters the night before. According to reports, gunshots were fired in Ferguson and five people were arrested.[36][37] Some protesters threw rocks at police officers. The police responded by firing tear gas and bean bag rounds at protesters which included State Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal.[38]\n",

He has two grandsons, Demarcus and Kemon Johnson.[2]\nMany in Blair's family have faced criminal charges, including murder.\nBlair's mother, Janice, shot and killed her common-law husband on August 16, 1978. She entered an Alford plea for second degree murder and was sentenced to five years of probation, with a condition that she receive counseling, therapy, and psychiatric treatment.\nSix months later, Blair's brother, Walter Blair Jr., allegedly killed 16-year-old Sandy Shannon during a robbery. Walter was charged with capital murder, robbery, and assault, but the case was dropped after witnesses refused to testify. On August 19, 1979, Walter Blair abducted, then shot and killed 21-year-old Katherine Jo Allen. Allen was the alleged victim in a rape case and Walter was paid $6,000 to kill her. He confessed to the murder, but later recanted. Walter was convicted of capital murder, sentenced to death, and executed on July 21, 1993, at the age of 32.[3]\nBlair's sister, Warnetta U. Blair, her husband, Noila White III, and another man faced charges for the murder of James L. Bell, whose body was found on September 27, 1980. Bell had been stabbed 30 times. Warnetta agreed to testify against her husband in exchange for charges against her being dropped. However, state law forbids spouses from testifying against each other. In 1984, White III pleaded guilty to second degree murder and received a 12-year sentence. White III would himself be murdered by his son and Blair's nephew, Noila White IV, in 2001. White IV pleaded guilty to second degree murder for killing his father and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.[3][4]\nIn December 1989, Warnetta killed her boyfriend, Pablo P. Gomez, a drug dealer from Cuba. Gomez's body was found bound and gagged.[5] According to prosecutors, Gomez had threatened to cut off his girlfriend's supply of crack cocaine. Warnetta said she and a male friend did not intend to kill Gomez, and only tied him up so they could take his drugs and money. She and her friend then went to a neighbor's apartment and said they had \"messed up Pablo\", before smoking crack that night. In August 1990, Warnetta pleaded guilty to second degree murder and received a 10-year sentence. She was released from prison in December 1999.[3]\nOne June 25, 1992, Blair's older brother, Clifford Miller, abducted a woman, forced her to perform oral sex at an abandoned house, and then beat her unconscious. The victim was hospitalized for more than two months. Her injuries consisted of a gunshot wound to the arm, a fractured skull, a broken jaw, and smashed cheekbones. The injury to the victim's arm was so serious that she had to get a bone in her arm replaced with metal. In 1994, Clifford was convicted forcible sodomy, assault, kidnapping, and armed criminal action. He was sentenced to two life terms plus 240 years.[3][6]\nIn December 1999, another of Blair's brothers, Daniel, pleaded guilty to federal drug charges and was sentenced to eight years and four months in prison. He and another man had been dealing crack. Daniel was released from prison on January 19, 2007.\n",

On March 22, 1989, Harrison was abducted from outside her home as she waited for the school bus. She was taken to a house where she was raped by her abductors before being stabbed to death in the trunk of a car.[1][2] Her two killers: Michael Anthony Taylor (January 30, 1967 \u2013 February 26, 2014) and Roderick Nunley (March 10, 1965 \u2013 September 1, 2015) were executed for the crime by the state of Missouri via lethal injection, in 2014 and 2015, respectively.[3][4]\nAnn Marie Harrison was born on February 22, 1974, in Kansas City, Missouri.[5][6] She attended Raytown South High School where she was a freshman honor student.[6]\nOn March 22, 1989, Harrison left her home to go to school and waited for the school bus outside her house. As she waited by the mailbox, a blue '84 Monte Carlo pulled up next to her. Inside the vehicle, which was stolen, were Taylor and Nunley. One of the two men exited the vehicle and asked Harrison for directions. As the man approached her, he pulled her towards him and forced her into the front of the vehicle. The men then sped off with Harrison in the car. A girl waiting for a bus spotted the vehicle speeding past her moments later. Meanwhile, the school bus arrived at Harrison's home and sounded the horn, but no one came. The driver noticed Harrison's books, purse, and flute case had been left by the mailbox. As the bus driver waited and sounded the horn, Harrison's mother came outside to see what was happening. Figuring her daughter was still inside the house, she instructed the bus driver to move on, saying she would drive her to school. After searching the house, Harrison's mother grew concerned when there was no sign of her. She headed to a neighbor's house and then called her husband and the police.[7]\nHarrison was driven to the home of Nunley's mother. Inside the vehicle, the men blindfolded her and threatened to kill her if she continued to scream. After parking in the garage, the two men led Harrison inside and took her to the basement. Both men then took turns raping her. Afterward, the men discussed what to do with her. Not wanting to let her go because she had seen their faces, the men told her to get into the trunk of the vehicle. As Harrison pleaded with them to let her live, both men stabbed her to death with kitchen knives as she lay in the trunk of the car. They then drove the car to a quiet street and left the area in another vehicle. Later on, local media began broadcasting the news of Harrison's disappearance.[7]\nThirty-six hours after Harrison's abduction, a neighbor reported the abandoned blue '84 Monte Carlo. When police checked the license, they learned the vehicle had been stolen. After calling the owner to collect it, he arrived and opened the trunk, discovering Harrison's body.[8] Three months after Harrison's murder, the reward for information leading to the capture of her killers had reached $9,000. A tipster then told police about Taylor and Nunley. When they were brought in, both confessed, but each blamed the other as the instigator of the crime. However, the semen and hair matched Taylor.[7]\nBoth men waived trials and pleaded guilty before a judge.[9] On May 3, 1991, the judge sentenced both men to death.[10]\nIn 1993, the Supreme Court of Missouri overturned the death sentences for Nunley and Taylor without commenting or providing a reason for doing so. Both men were then retried.[11][12]\nOn May 10, 1994, Nunley was sentenced to death for the second time. In addition, the judge sentenced him to life in prison for rape, life in prison for armed criminal action, and fifteen years for kidnapping.[11]\nOn June 17, 1994, Taylor was also sentenced to death for the second time. The judge also sentenced Taylor to life in prison for rape, fifty years for armed criminal action, and fifteen years for kidnapping. The sentences were to run consecutively.[12]\n",

He said, \"After an exhaustive review of the facts in both cases, I am commuting the sentences of Stacey Lannert and Charity Carey, who suffered extensive abuse before they took action against the men who raped them and subjected them to other horrible physical and emotional abuse.\"[2] Lannert's new sentence of 20 years made her eligible for immediate conditional release, and she was released on January 16, 2009.[2]\nLannert founded a resource website and non-profit organization, Healing Sisters, to aid women who have suffered abuse. In 2011, she published a memoir about her experiences, Redemption: A Story of Sisterhood, Survival, and Finding Freedom Behind Bars.\nStacey Lannert was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1972, the daughter of Deb Underwood and Thomas Lannert. She has said that she was close to her father and he made her feel special, but he was drinking to excess and started sexually abusing her when she was eight, and raped her at nine.[2] Her parents divorced when she was young. Although she tried to tell her mother and a babysitter about her father's rapes, she did not have the language to make them understand, and he had threatened her to keep her quiet. Her sister Christy, two years younger, has said their father physically abused and beat her from when she was in first grade, becoming especially violent when drinking.[2]\nStacey Lannert went to live with her mother, then in Guam, six months before the murder. Her sister Christy begged her to return, and Lannert tried to persuade her father to let Christy live with her and her mother. He would not let her go.[2]\nAt the age of 18, in the town of St. John, Missouri, Lannert shot her father twice while he was sleeping on a sofa. After confessing to killing him, she said that he had repeatedly raped and abused her as a child, threatening her so she would maintain secrecy. She said that, based on fears for her sister, she had decided to kill him to stop him.[2]\nShe testified that on July 4, 1990, she and her sister got home late, entering the house via a basement window at approximately 4:15\u20134:30\u00a0a.m. Seeing a rifle, she decided to kill her father. Finding her father asleep on the sofa, she shot him. This shot broke his collarbone and startled him awake. In fear, Stacey closed her eyes and shot again.  The next day, she consulted with an adult friend, who encouraged her and helped her to dispose of the murder weapon. She called the police, initially pretending to have found her father dead on the sofa upon returning home, but then confessed the murder to Lt.\u00a0Tom Schulte, saying it was because of the years of abuse she had suffered.\nStacey Lannert was charged with first degree murder and other felonies. Lannert's lawyer offered the defense of insanity or mental defect after his attempt to use the \"battered spouse syndrome\" in her defense. In a pre-trial ruling, the court limited mention of \"battered spouse syndrome\" but allowed the defendant to make \"an offer of proof of self-defense\". The St. Louis County prosecutor, Bob McCulloch, never called Schulte to testify, although he was the first official to talk with Lannert and had years of experience with sexual abuse victims.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "John F. Kennedy[1] (ca. 1870 \u2013 November 3, 1922) was an American outlaw, described as \"the West's last notorious train robber\".[2]\nKennedy, nicknamed \"the Quail Hunter\", was from Missouri. He had a record of seven train robberies within three years (1896\u201399), and served twelve years in the Missouri Penitentiary. He stood at liberty from 1912 until his death.[3]\nSeveral weeks prior to his last robbery, a railway inspector ran into Kennedy near Memphis and learned that he was making frequent short trips on the line from Memphis to points in northern Arkansas. The inspector became suspicious and notified a colleague.[3] It was decided that the train to watch was the night train from St. Louis to Memphis, which frequently carried considerable amounts of money from the Federal Reserve Bank, sent south to move the cotton crop.[3]\nEarly on November 3, 1922, Kennedy and his companion Harvey Logan, a former railroad employee, stopped a southbound passenger train of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway. The train, traveling from St. Louis to Memphis, was forced to halt at a station 7\u00bd miles north of Wittenberg just outside the small community of Seventy-Six, Missouri. Logan cut the mail and express cars from the rest of the train. The engineer and fireman were ordered off the locomotive and Kennedy took the two cars down the track several miles. After stopping the locomotive, the two bandits entered the mail car. The three clerks were lined up against a wall. Kennedy inspected the mail, taking several pouches to the cab of the locomotive. The locomotive then was detached and Kennedy and Logan rode to Wittenberg. About 150 yards from the station, they jumped from the engine and left it running wild.[3]\nTheir automobile was nearby, and concealed in the brush along the right of way were six postal inspectors, three railroad special agents and two deputy sheriffs. An inspector commanded them to halt. In the bright moonlight the officers saw Kennedy and Logan reach for their weapons. Several of them opened fire and the robbers fell dead, still clutching their revolvers.[3]\nThe stolen mail, about 100 registered letters, was recovered.\n",

The pair were believed to have been seen together at a truck stop in Missouri, which is where the murders are presumed to have taken place. Hendricks was left at the crime scene, while Mills was found in Mississippi County, Arkansas.[1][2]\nHendricks was identified in May 2017; Mills' identity was confirmed in late 2017, and publicly released in early February 2018.[3] Neither had been reported missing. Both were from Michigan.[4]\nThe bodies later identified as Hendricks and Mills were discovered on June 17, 1978 in Pemiscot County, Missouri, and Blytheville, Arkansas, respectively. Although they were found fifteen miles from each other, they were likely murdered by the same person, as the pair were reportedly seen together before the murders at a truck stop in the same town and were believed to have been dropped off by a man.[5]\nDue to flooding, their case files were damaged, including the loss of their fingerprint records, although their dental charts and DNA information remained intact.[6][7] In September 2017, both victims were identified.[5]\nHendricks's age range was between 25 and his early 30s; this placed his birth between c. 1948 and 1953.[8] He was discovered in Pemiscot County, Missouri, where it is believed the murders took place.[6][7][9] He had blue eyes, brown hair and a light complexion with freckles. Hendricks had a tattoo on his right arm, which consisted of the letters \"J\" and \"H\", later found to be his initials. He was estimated to be 5\u00a0feet 8\u00a0inches (1.73\u00a0m) tall and weighing 130 to 140 pounds (59 to 64\u00a0kg). He had a distinctive vertical scar on his forehead, the cause of which was unknown. He wore a red shirt containing a graphic of a woman enclosed inside a circle, with the words \"hot sauce\" underneath. Other clothing included size nine or ten boots and blue jeans. Some of his teeth were reported to have been missing.[8]\nUnlike Mills, who was shot once, Hendricks had suffered three bullet wounds to his neck and head.[5]\nMills was determined to be between the ages of 18 and 25, although possibly as old as 35; this placed her birth between c. 1943 and 1960.[6] Her hair was naturally brown, but was likely dyed blond, as its color was darker toward the roots. The word \"Kim\" was amateurishly tattooed on her right arm; this was speculated, before her identification, to have been her own or her child's name, as her autopsy concluded that she had borne at least one child. Some of her teeth had yet to erupt.[2][6] She was shot once in the head with a shotgun.[6] Her possessions included a mercury dime necklace and a multicolored striped shirt and jeans.[1][7]\nHendricks's identity was confirmed first, in May 2017. His DNA was matched to his sister June. Additionally, his fingerprints were linked to those taken by the Michigan Department of Corrections; Hendricks had served a prison term in Michigan for an unspecified offense. After his relatives were contacted by police with questions about his female companion, they informed the investigators of his girlfriend at the time. Mills' brother's DNA was later obtained and was matched to her remains in February 2018. The couple had not been reported missing due to the belief that they left Michigan due to Hendricks's parole agreement.[10] The pair had planned to leave for Texas and return home after seven years, according to Hendricks' sister.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "Charles Binaggio (January 12, 1909 - April 6, 1950) was an American gangster who became the boss of the Kansas City crime family and concocted a bold plan to control the police forces in Kansas City, Missouri and St. Louis, Missouri.\nBorn in Beaumont, Texas, Binaggio moved with his family to Kansas City, Missouri, at an early age. Binaggio grew up in the city's North Side, which was then heavily populated by Sicilian and Italian immigrants. It isn't known when first Binaggio fell in with the mob; when he did join them, he rose quietly to prominence.[1]\nIn December 1930, in Denver, Colorado, Binaggio was arrested for the first time at age 21.  The police raided a Denver apartment that Binaggio shared with Anthony Gizzo and Tony Casciola, two well-known Kansas City Mafiosi. Searching the apartment, police found a mini-cache of firearms and charged the three with weapons violations. The charges were later reduced to vagrancy and Binaggio was released on bond. As it turns out, Binaggio had been part of a team sent to Denver by then Kansas City boss John Lazia to aid the Denver crime family in a \"war\" with the crime family from Pueblo, Colorado.  In 1931, Binaggio was again arrested in Denver for vagrancy.[1]\nBinaggio earned his prominence in the Kansas City family by earning a lot of money from liquor and gambling.  On July 20, 1931 Binaggio was arrested in Kansas City following a shootout that killed a Bureau of Prohibition agent and two others.  Prohibition agents and local police had raided the mob-run Lusco-Noto Flower Shop at 1039 E. Independence Avenue looking for evidence in a recent \"spot\" killing. The building was also the headquarters of Joe Lusco, a lieutenant of Lazia.  During the raid, a shootout started, followed by a fire. Binaggio, who was in the flower shop during the raid, was arrested and taken in for questioning. However, the police determined that he hadn't taken part in the shootout and released him with a vagrancy charge.\nAfter the Lusco-Noto shootout, Lazia took Binaggio under his wing. Lazia had established a political club, the North Side Democratic Club, in order to increase his mob's power in Kansas City. This led to Binaggio's involvement with the local and State political scene that would last until his death in 1950.\nIn 1934, Lazia was assassinated and his underboss Charles \"Charley the Wop\" Carrollo ascended to the crime throne. At some point, Binaggio became Carollo's underboss. In 1939, Carollo was caught up in a citywide clean-up campaign and was sent to prison for income tax evasion. This opened the way for Binaggio to become the Kansas City mob's boss in October 1939.\nThe Kansas City crime family had always enjoyed a violent reputation.  It started back to the turn of the 20th century when the Black Hand version of the Mafia terrorized the city's North Side. The violence had reached a peak during and immediately following the Lazia years (1928\u20131934), but things had remained relatively quiet under Carollo's rule. This would change under Binaggio as several unsolved mob slayings occurred on his watch.\nIn November 1941, Binaggio was speeding down Broadway near his Armour Boulevard apartment when he struck and killed a 50-year-old man while crossing the street. Binaggio was arrested and charged with manslaughter, but a coroner's jury refused to indict him. Following this incident, Binaggio was always accompanied by his driver, Nick Penna.[1]\nBinaggio and the local mob continued to get rich through their gambling and liquor interests.  From the 1930s on, the mob had also been making money through a nationwide narcotics ring.  However, this ring was broken up by a major Bureau of Narcotics investigation that netted mafiosi in Kansas City, St. Louis, Tampa, Florida, and other cities. Binaggio himself escaped being linked to this drug ring.  However, one of his main lieutenants, Joe DeLuca, was sent to prison when a low-level member of the ring, Carl Caramusa, turned state's evidence. In 1945, Caramusa was found murdered on a Chicago street.\n",

Hendron fired about 100 rounds of ammunition, killing two people in the parking lot and another person inside the factory before killing himself.[5]\nFive people were injured in the incident, including two in critical condition. Two more were in fair condition, and the fifth person injured had been admitted to a hospital and released. Other employees took refuge on the roof of the building or in offices within the factory.[2] During the shooting, an employee at the facility retrieved a handgun from his car and was injured while returning fire when the gunman was moving down the hall towards a group of workers who were hiding in a break room.[6]\nThe following were killed in the shooting:[7]\nPolice identified the shooter as 51-year-old Timothy Gerard Hendron (August 2, 1958 \u2014 January 7, 2010),[8] a resident of Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, and an employee of ABB.

He succeeded William Egan as head of the Egan's Rats bootlegging gang in the early 1920s.[1]\nBorn in North St. Louis with German and Irish roots, Colbeck joined Egan's Rats in his late teens. In between his gangster jobs, Colbeck trained to work as a plumber. His work in this field resulted in his nickname of \"Dinty\" or \"Dint\", as he was most usually called by associates. After the outbreak of World War I, Colbeck joined the U.S. Army in April 1918 and fought as an infantryman with the 89th Infantry Division in France. Upon his return home in 1919, Colbeck became Willie Egan's right-hand man in the gang.\nOn October 31, 1921, Willie Egan was shot dead in front of his Franklin Avenue saloon by gunmen in a passing automobile. Colbeck had been present at the time of the shooting and Egan reportedly whispered to him the names of the shooters before he died. Now the leader of the gang, Dint announced to his men that Egan's killers were Jimmy Hogan, John Doyle, and Luke Kennedy. These three belonged to the Rats' arch-rivals, the Hogan Gang, which was led by Edward \"Jelly Roll\" Hogan, the Missouri state beverage inspector. Colbeck and his men immediately retaliated and gang warfare engulfed St. Louis.\nDuring the first years of Prohibition, the Rats controlled most of the illegal bootlegging in and around St. Louis. They also began to supplement their bootlegging profits with armed robberies that victimized banks, armored cars, and messengers. It was estimated that Egan's Rats stole nearly $4,000,000 over a five-year period. Colbeck was ruthless with anyone who got in the gang's way, including its own members.\nDint Colbeck was the most powerful gangster in St. Louis during the early 1920s. He and his men were headquartered at the Maxwelton Club in North St. Louis County, and Colbeck often dispensed bribes, illegal booze, or other favors from his roost. Dint also served as the sergeant-at-arms of the St. Louis Democratic City Committee, giving him a political base inside the city government. While Colbeck was shot and wounded by the Hogan Gang during the gang war, he successfully led his crew against their rivals until a peace treaty was brokered in June 1922 by Monsignor Timothy Dempsey. While Dint did not usually accompany his men on jobs, he had no qualms about getting his hands dirty. Having survived years on the streets and combat on the Western Front, Colbeck was fearless under fire and an expert shot; his weapon of choice was the BAR.\nThe Egan-Hogan gang war re-ignited when Colbeck and five of his men assassinated Hogan Gang lawyer Jacob Mackler on February 21, 1923. Shootings again rocked the city of St. Louis. By Easter Sunday 1923, both Dint and Jelly Roll Hogan wrote letters to the citizens of St. Louis telling them that the war was finally finished once and for all; both notes were published in the St. Louis Star.\nBy 1924, Colbeck and the Rats were at the height of their power, but trouble was coming fast. Cliques had developed in the gang, and Colbeck surrounded himself with his four core gunmen: bodyguard Louis \"Red\" Smith, Steve Ryan, Oliver Daugherty, and sharpshooter David \"Chippy\" Robinson. A handful of Rats either fled town or ran afoul of Dint Colbeck. In one instance of intra-gang turmoil, Dint and his four top men executed disgruntled Egan gang member Eddie Linehan at the Maxwelton Club on February 13, 1924.\nBy this time, the law was closing in as well. Colbeck and his top henchmen went on trial for two 1923 mail robberies, one of which netted the gang nearly $2.4 million US in cash and negotiable bonds. In order to pay his crew's mounting legal fees, Dint led some of the boys on the robbery of the Granite City National Bank on April 25, 1924, netting $63,000. Colbeck was also suspected of ordering an assassination attempt on his longtime benefactor and associate, Missouri State Senator Michael Kinney, on June 3, 1924. Kinney survived his wounds, and no one was charged in his shooting.\n",

At age seven, his family moved him to Kansas City, where he was raised in a rather poor environment. In his late teens, he began working as a semiliterate laborer.[2]\nIn the span of seven months, between September 1989 and April 1990, the bodies of six women were found dumped in areas in or around Gillham park, mid-town of Kansas City, Missouri.[2] They were prostitutes in their 20s and 30s.[3]\nIn April 1990, a man walking his dog through Gillham Park spotted a man having sex with a woman. Upon closer inspection, however, it became clear that it was an act of rape.[4] The perpetrator fled the area when the man intervened. The woman regained consciousness and was able to give a description of the man. Police had an idea of the suspect's geographic pattern, as he either lives near, or had connections with the park. After questioning people in the area, they told police about Ray Jackson. Police took Jackson into questioning, and after an interrogation, he confessed. He told the police that he had been involved in multiple murders.[2]\nJackson said he would walk alone at night and ask women on the streets if they wanted to smoke crack cocaine. After the woman agreed, he would walk with her to a secluded area in or near Gillham Park, where he choked them from behind until they lost consciousness. He would then awaken them, strip them, rape them, and strangle them. Jackson would position the bodies in sexually provocative poses and leave their clothes strewn around the crime scene.\nThe case of the surviving victim was different in that Jackson had followed her beforehand. When he asked her to join him, she refused. Jackson later attacked her and dragged into some bushes, where he tried to choke her before the passerby intervened.   \nTo avoid a possible death sentence, Jackson pleaded guilty to six counts of first degree murder and one count of first degree assault for the surviving victim. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Jackson is currently incarcerated at South Central Correctional Center.[5]\n",

There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and who had the \"mental capacity of a 7-year-old due to brain damage\" as the result of premature birth.\nAfter reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult and did not have any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.[3]\nFurther investigation found that some of the doctors who had examined Gypsy Rose had found no evidence of the claimed disorders. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nDee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent.[4] Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence;[1] after a brief trial in November 2018, Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[5]\nDee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow.[6] Blanchard was one of five children of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr. and Emma Lois Gisclair.[7]\nRelatives recalled that she had a habit of stealing from her family, which they speculated was a form of retaliation when \"things didn't go her way\".[8] At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse's aide.[3] The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food.[8]\nWhen she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses.[a] Shortly before Gypsy Rose's birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod realized he \"got married for the wrong reasons\". He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.[3]\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder.[3] At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker.[9]\n",

        "paragraph": "Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), was a landmark decision in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that it is unconstitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed while under the age of 18.[1] The 5\u20134 decision overruled Stanford v. Kentucky,[2] in which the court had upheld execution of offenders at or above age 16, and overturned statutes in 25 states.\nIn 1993, in the state of Missouri, 17-year-old Christopher Simmons, along with two younger friends, Charles Benjamin and John Tessmer, concocted a plan to murder Shirley Crook. The plan was to commit burglary and murder by breaking and entering, tying up a victim. The three met in the middle of the night; however, Tessmer dropped out of the plot. Simmons and Benjamin broke into Mrs. Crook's home, bound her hands and covered her eyes. They drove her to a state park and threw her off a bridge. Later she was found dead by drowning; she was 46 years of age.\nOnce the case was brought to trial, the evidence was overwhelming. Simmons had confessed to the murder, performed a videotaped reenactment at the crime scene, and there was testimony from Tessmer against him that showed premeditation (Simmons discussed the plot in advance and later bragged about the crime). The jury returned a guilty verdict. Even considering mitigating factors (no criminal history and his age),  the jury recommended a death sentence, which the trial court imposed.\nSimmons moved for the trial court to set aside the conviction and sentence, citing, in part, ineffective assistance of counsel. His age, and thus impulsiveness, along with a troubled background, were brought up as issues that Simmons claimed should have been raised at the sentencing phase. The trial court rejected the motion, and Simmons appealed.[3]\nThe case worked its way up the court system, with the courts continuing to uphold the death sentence.[4] However, in light of a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, in Atkins v. Virginia,[5] that overturned the death penalty for the intellectually disabled, Simmons filed a new petition for state post-conviction relief. The Supreme Court of Missouri concluded that \"a national consensus has developed against the execution of juvenile offenders\" and held that such punishment now violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.[6] They sentenced Simmons to life imprisonment without parole.\nThe State of Missouri appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.[7]\nThis case was argued on October 13, 2004. The appeal challenged the constitutionality of capital punishment for persons who were juveniles when their crimes were committed, citing the Eighth Amendment protection against cruel and unusual punishment.\nA 1988 Supreme Court decision, Thompson v. Oklahoma,[8] barred execution of offenders under the age of 16. In 1989, another case, Stanford v. Kentucky,[2] upheld the possibility of capital punishment for offenders who were 16 or 17 years old when they committed the capital offense. The same day in 1989, the Supreme Court ruled in Penry v. Lynaugh[9] that it was permissible to execute the intellectually disabled. However, in 2002, that decision was overruled in Atkins v. Virginia,[5] where the Court held that evolving standards of decency had made the execution of the mentally retarded \"cruel and unusual punishment\" and thus unconstitutional.\nUnder the \"evolving standards of decency\" test, the Court held that it was cruel and unusual punishment to execute a person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the murder.  Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy cited a body of sociological and scientific research[1] that found that juveniles have a lack of maturity and sense of responsibility compared to adults. Adolescents were found to be over-represented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior. The Court noted that in recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every state prohibited those under age 18 from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent. The studies also found that juveniles are more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. They have less control, or experience with control, over their own environment. They also lack the freedom that adults have, to escape a criminogenic setting.[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "Continental Airlines Flight 11, registration N70775, was a Boeing 707 aircraft which exploded in the vicinity of Centerville, Iowa, while en route from O'Hare Airport, Chicago, Illinois, to Kansas City, Missouri, on May 22, 1962. The aircraft crashed in a clover field near Unionville, in Putnam County, Missouri, killing all 45 crew and passengers on board. The investigation determined the cause of the crash was a suicide bombing committed as insurance fraud.\nThe perpetrator, Thomas G. Doty, arrived at the gate just moments before departure.[1]\nFlight 11 departed O'Hare at 8:35\u00a0p.m. The flight crew consisted of Captain Fred R. Gray (50), First Officer Edward J. Sullivan (41), Flight Engineer Roger D. \"Jack\" Allen (32), and five flight attendants. The flight was routine until just before the Mississippi River when it deviated from its filed flight plan to the north to avoid a line of thunderstorms.[2] In the vicinity of Centerville, Iowa, the radar image of the aircraft disappeared from the scope of the Waverly, Iowa, Flight Following Service. At approximately 9:17\u00a0p.m. an explosion occurred in the right rear lavatory, resulting in the separation of the tail section from the fuselage.[3] The flight crew initiated the required emergency descent procedures and donned their smoke masks due to the dense fog that formed in the cabin immediately after decompression. Following the separation of the tail, the remaining aircraft structure pitched nose down violently, causing the engines to tear off, after which it fell in uncontrolled gyrations. The fuselage of the Boeing 707, minus the aft 38 feet (12\u00a0m), and with part of the left and most of the right wing intact, struck the ground, headed westerly down a 10-degree slope of an alfalfa field.[4]\nWitnesses in and around both Cincinnati, Iowa and Unionville reported hearing loud and unusual noises at around 9:20\u00a0p.m. Two more saw a big flash or ball of fire in the sky. A B-47 Stratojet bomber flying out of Forbes Air Force Base in Topeka, Kansas was flying at the altitude of 26,500\u00a0ft (8,100\u00a0m) in the vicinity of Kirksville, Missouri. The aircraft commander saw a bright flash in the sky forward and above his aircraft's position. After referring to his navigation logs, he estimated the flash to have occurred at 9:22\u00a0p.m. near the location where the last radar target of Flight 11 had been seen. Most of the fuselage was found near Unionville, but the engines and parts of the tail section, and left wing were found up to six miles (9.7\u00a0km) away from the main wreckage.[4]\nOf the 45 individuals on board, 44 were dead when rescuers reached the crash site. One passenger, a 27-year-old man from Evanston, Illinois, died of internal injuries at Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital in Centerville, Iowa, an hour and a half after being rescued.[5][6]\nFBI agents discovered that Doty, a married man with a five-year-old daughter, had purchased a life insurance policy from Mutual of Omaha for $150,000 (roughly equivalent to $1.04\u00a0million in 2022), the maximum available; his death would also bring in another $150,000 in additional insurance (some purchased at the airport) and death benefits. Doty was about to appear in court on an armed robbery charge. Doty had purchased six sticks of dynamite shortly before the flight, took them into the lavatory in his briefcase, and ignited them. His motive was that his wife and daughter would collect on the $300,000 of life insurance. His widow attempted to collect on the insurance, but the policy was voided when Doty's death was ruled a suicide.[7]\nIn July 2010, a memorial was erected near the crash site in Unionville, Missouri on the anniversary of the crash.[8][9]\nIn May 2012, a special 50th-anniversary memorial service was held in Unionville.\n",

        "paragraph": "Ken Rex McElroy (June 1, 1934 \u2013 July 10, 1981) was an American criminal and convicted attempted murderer who resided in Skidmore, Missouri, United States. He was known as \"the town bully\",[1] and his unsolved killing became the focus of international attention. Over the course of his life, McElroy was accused of dozens of felonies, including assault, child molestation, statutory rape, arson, animal cruelty, hog and cattle rustling, and burglary.[2]\nIn all, he was indicted 21 times but escaped conviction each time, except for the last.[2][3] In 1981, McElroy was convicted of attempted murder in the shooting of the town's 70-year-old grocer Ernest \"Bo\" Bowenkamp.[1] McElroy successfully appealed the conviction and was released on bond, after which he engaged in an ongoing harassment campaign against Bowenkamp and others who were sympathetic to Bowenkamp, including the town's Church of Christ minister. He appeared in a local bar, the D&G Tavern, armed with an M1 Garand rifle and bayonet, and later threatened to kill Bowenkamp.[1][3] The next day, McElroy was shot to death in broad daylight as he sat with his wife Trena in his pickup truck on Skidmore's main street.[2] He was struck by bullets from at least two different firearms, in front of a crowd of people estimated as numbering between 30 and 46.[1] To date, no one has been charged in connection with McElroy's death.[1]\nMcElroy was born in 1934, the 15th of 16 children born to a poor, migrant tenant-farming couple named Tony and Mabel (n\u00e9e Lister) McElroy, who had moved between Kansas and the Ozarks before settling outside of Skidmore. He dropped out of school at age 15 in the eighth grade and quickly established a local reputation as a cattle rustler, small-time thief, and womanizer. For more than two decades, McElroy was suspected of being involved in theft of grain, gasoline, alcohol, antiques, and livestock, but he avoided conviction when charges were brought against him 21 times\u2014often after witnesses refused to testify because he allegedly intimidated them, frequently by following his targets or parking outside their homes and watching them. He was represented by defense attorney Richard Gene McFadin of Gallatin, Missouri.[4]\nMcElroy fathered more than 10 children with different women. He met his last wife, Trena McCloud (1957\u20132012), when she was 12 years old and in eighth grade. He raped McCloud repeatedly. The 12-year-old's parents initially opposed the relationship, but after McElroy burned their house down and shot the family dog, they relented and agreed to the marriage.[5] She became pregnant when she was fourteen, dropped out of school in the ninth grade, and went to live with McElroy and his second wife Alice. McElroy divorced Alice and married Trena in order to escape charges of statutory rape, to which she was the only witness. Sixteen days after Trena gave birth, both she and Alice fled to Trena's mother's and stepfather's house. According to court records, McElroy tracked them down and brought them back. He then returned to Trena's parents' home when they were away and, once again, shot the family dog and burned the house down.[6]\nBased on Trena's story, McElroy was indicted in June 1973 for arson, assault, and statutory rape. He was arrested, booked, arraigned, and released on $2,500 bail.[6] Trena and her baby were placed in foster care at a home in Maryville, Missouri. McElroy sat outside the foster home for hours at a time staring at it. He told the foster family that he would trade \"girl for girl\" to get his child back, since he knew where the foster family's biological daughter went to school and what bus route she rode. Additional charges were filed against McElroy.[7]\nOn July 27, 1976, Skidmore farmer Romaine Henry said McElroy shot him twice with a shotgun after Henry challenged him for shooting weapons on Henry's property. McElroy was charged with assault with intent to kill. McElroy denied he was at the scene. As the case dragged on without a court date, Henry said McElroy had parked outside his home at least 100 times.[8] At the trial, two raccoon hunters testified they were with McElroy the day of the shooting away from Henry's property. Henry was forced to admit in court, under questioning by McElroy's attorney Richard Gene McFadin, that he had concealed his own petty criminal conviction from more than 30 years previous.[3] McElroy was acquitted.\nIn 1980, one of McElroy's children got into an argument with a clerk, Evelyn Sumy, in a local grocery store owned by 70-year-old Ernest \"Bo\" Bowenkamp and his wife Lois, allegedly because the young McElroy child tried to steal some candy. McElroy began stalking the Bowenkamp family, and eventually threatened Bo Bowenkamp in the back of his store with a shotgun in hand. In the ensuing confrontation, McElroy shot Bowenkamp in the neck; Bowenkamp survived, and McElroy was arrested and charged with attempted murder.[9] McElroy was convicted at trial of assault, but freed on bail pending his appeal. Immediately after being released at a post-trial hearing, McElroy went to the D&G Tavern, a local bar, with an M1 Garand rifle with a bayonet attached, and made graphic threats about what he would do to Bo Bowenkamp. This led to several patrons deciding to see what they could legally do to prevent McElroy from harming anyone else. Nodaway County Sheriff Dan Estes suggested they form a neighborhood watch.\nMcElroy's appeal hearing was again delayed. On the morning of July 10, 1981, townspeople met at the Legion Hall in the center of town with Sheriff Estes to discuss how to protect themselves. During the meeting, McElroy arrived at the D&G Tavern with Trena. As he sat drinking at the bar, word got back to the men at the Legion Hall that he was in town. Sheriff Estes instructed the assembled group not to get into a direct confrontation with McElroy, but instead seriously consider forming a neighborhood watch program. Estes then drove out of town in his police cruiser. The citizens decided to go to the tavern en masse. The bar soon filled completely. \nAfter McElroy finished his drinks, he purchased a six pack of beer, left the bar, and entered his pickup truck. Someone shot at McElroy while he was sitting in his truck. He was shot at several times and hit twice, once by a centerfire rifle and once by a .22 rimfire rifle. In all, there were 46 potential witnesses to the shooting, including Trena McElroy, who was in the truck with her husband when he was shot.[10] No one called for an ambulance.[11] Only Trena claimed to identify a gunman; every other witness either was unable to name an assailant or claimed not to have seen who fired the fatal shots.[12] The DA declined to press charges. An extensive federal investigation did not lead to any charges. Missouri-based journalist Steve Booher described the attitude of some townspeople as, \"He needed killing.\"[13]\n",

His death was streamed on Facebook Live.[13][14]\nThe thirteen-minute video was briefly taken down by Facebook before being reinstated with a warning screen. In the video, a young man states: \"Oh my God, cuz....They just killed this old man at the pawn shop over some TVs....c'mon, man, that's somebody's granddaddy.\"[14]\nCrime Stoppers offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest;[13] this amount was later raised to $56,700.\nOn June 5, St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Homicide Section released surveillance footage to the public to provide clues and evidence in their investigation of David Dorn's death.[15][16] The video captured a total of seven suspects trespassing at Lee's Pawn and Jewelry at 4123 Martin Luther King Drive. The footage was taken on June 2 from 2:13\u00a0a.m. to 2:16\u00a0a.m. All suspects in the video had their faces concealed. Six wore masks, and one had a white shirt wrapped around his face and head. At least two of the men were seen armed with handguns. One person pulled his handgun to target the entrance before joining the others. Another suspect had a cut on his left palm. The reward for additional information that could capture the criminals was raised another $6,000 since the surveillance video's release.[15][16]\nOn June 7, a 24-year-old suspect named Stephan Cannon was arrested. He faces charges of first-degree murder, robbery, and being a felon in possession of a firearm.[17] As of June 18, a total of six persons have been charged, two for murder and four for burglary and stealing. Cannon's trial started on July 18, 2022 [18] During the trial Stephans co-defendant Mark Jackson testified against Cannon in a plea deal which Cannon plead guilty to first-degree robbery and burglary which dropped Jackson\u2019s charges of second-degree murder, stealing and three counts of armed criminal action in exchange for Jackson\u2019s testimony that he drove Cannon to and from the pawn shop where Dorn was killed, in terms of the plea deal Jackson was given a suspended 15-year prison sentence that includes five years probation.[19]\n",

At the time of the murder, Mercer had a charge pending against him of raping a 17-year-old girl. He was executed at the age of 44 by the state of Missouri by lethal injection. He became the first person to be executed in Missouri since 1965.[1] His execution was carried out in the former gas chamber which was converted to use lethal injection.[2]\nLate on August 30, 1978, George Mercer went drinking with friends from one of his motorcycle gangs at a lounge in Grandview, Missouri. While there, he noticed 22-year-old Karen Ann Keeton, who was working at the lounge as a waitress, and commented to a friend that he would like to sleep with her. Prior to the day of the murder, Mercer and Keeton had never met.[3] One of Mercer's friends, Steven Gardner, approached Keeton and invited her out to breakfast with him, after which the two would visit Mercer's house in Belton, Missouri. His plan was to hand Keeton over to Mercer as a \"birthday present,\" since the next day was Mercer's 34th birthday.[4]\nMercer then left the lounge with David Gee, a fellow gang member, and went back to his Belton home, arriving shortly after midnight on August 31. Another of Mercer's friends, John Allen Campbell, was already at the house babysitting Mercer's 10-year-old daughter, who was at the house and witnessed parts of the ensuing assault and murder. Shortly after Mercer and Gee's arrival, Gardner and Keeton arrived at the house as well. Mercer then threatened Keeton with a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun and ordered her to go upstairs to his bedroom. When she hesitated and asked Gardner for help, Gardner responded, \"Happy birthday, Tiny,\" directed towards Mercer. Mercer raped Keeton in his bedroom; later, Gardner sexually assaulted her as well, followed by David Gee. Gardner also stole money from Keeton's purse.[5]\nAfter the multiple sexual assaults were over, Campbell would later testify that he went upstairs to comfort the victim, who was crying; afterwards, he fell asleep. Mercer headed upstairs afterwards, and on his way, he passed Gardner; he asked Gardner what they should do with the victim, and Gardner replied that they should kill Keeton. Mercer agreed. When Gardner asked Mercer if he would need help, Mercer refused and claimed that he knew of a good location to hide the body where it would never be found. Gardner and Gee left the house while Mercer advanced upstairs, where he manually strangled Keeton to death. At one point, Mercer called for Campbell and asked Campbell to take Keeton's pulse, and when Campbell detected a faint pulse, Mercer began striking Keeton's head and body while he continued to strangle her. Campbell again checked for a pulse and found none, at which point Mercer removed Keeton's body from his bed. He ordered Campbell to clean the crime scene and placed his sheets and blanket in his washing machine. Afterwards, Mercer and Campbell loaded Keeton's body into Mercer's pickup truck.[6][5]\nCampbell drove the truck while Mercer directed him on where to go until they reached a desolate field, where Mercer dumped the body over a fence. When Mercer returned to the truck, he told Campbell that he wished he had murdered a 17-year-old girl who he had also raped earlier, stating that if he had, \"I wouldn't have been on any rape charges and things I'm on right now.\" At the time of Keeton's murder, Mercer had a rape charge pending against him that the 17-year-old victim filed against him. When the two returned to Mercer's house, Campbell hid Mercer's shotgun, while Mercer burned Keeton's purse.[5]\nSometime between then and late September 1978, John Campbell acquired an attorney, who helped him to locate Keeton's body. Three to four weeks after the murder, Campbell and his attorney found Keeton's badly decomposed body in the field where Mercer had left it. Campbell's attorney reported the body to authorities.[5][7]\nOver the next few weeks, Campbell would later testify that Kansas City police approached him three separate times to question him about Keeton's disappearance and what he might have known about it. Campbell told them he knew nothing about it; he would later testify at a preliminary hearing that he was waiting for family to relocate from the area before he approached an attorney to come clean with what he knew about the murder. In late September, Campbell acquired an attorney, Sidney Willems,[7] who helped him to find Keeton's badly decomposed body. The body was found in Johnson County, Missouri, on September 29 in the field where Mercer had left it. Campbell and his attorney reported the body to authorities; Campbell was then taken into protective custody.[6] After being placed in protective custody, Campbell fully confessed to his role in the murder and agreed to testify for the state in exchange for immunity,[7] while Mercer and Gardner were taken into custody and held without bond at the Cass County Jail.[6]\nAfter being taken into custody, Mercer was charged with the rape of the 17-year-old girl, which occurred in July 1978.[8] While Mercer awaited trial, he was brought in for a hearing regarding the gang rape of another woman which occurred on August 17, 1978, weeks before Keeton's murder. The victim testified at a hearing in mid-October 1978 that Mercer forcibly removed her from her home and took her to a field near Belton, Missouri, where Mercer and several of his friends raped her.[9]\n",

Her case was notable both for her youth and for the extended legal process that preceded her execution. Although her exact age is unknown, it is generally agreed that she is the youngest person to have been put to death in Missouri.\nMary was originally owned by Abraham Brinker, who had settled in Potosi, Missouri, in the 1810s. She was described as \"mulatto\", though it is unclear if she had any biological relationship to the Brinker family.[1] Abraham was killed by Native Americans in 1833, and his slaves were inherited by his son John. John's first child, Vienna Jane Brinker, was born on May 25, 1835, and Mary was tasked with babysitting her. In February 1837, the family and their slaves moved into what would become known as the Snelson-Brinker House, a single-story log cabin near Steelville.[2]\nOn May 14, 1837, the body of Vienna Brinker was discovered in a stream on the Brinker property. She had suffered blunt trauma to her right temple. John Brinker's wife Sarah had asked Mary to gather firewood, and she took Vienna with her. She later returned to the house without Vienna, and claimed not to know where she was. John Brinker gathered two of his neighbors, William Blackwell and Thomas Shirley, to help search for his daughter. They eventually followed Mary's footsteps down to the stream, where Shirley found her body.[2] Some sources have speculated that Mary killed Vienna because her father was planning to sell her.[3]\nAfter the discovery of the body, Mary was tied to a log by William Blackwell and threatened with a whipping. She subsequently admitted to throwing Vienna in the stream and then beating her body with a stick to stop it surfacing. She later made a similar confession to Simeon Frost, a local justice of the peace. Mary was charged with first-degree murder and placed in the Potosi jail.[1] Her trial began on August 16, 1837, and she was provided with three court-appointed attorneys. She was found guilty two days later, and subsequently sentenced to be hanged at Steelville on September 30.[4]\nMary appealed the verdict to the Missouri Supreme Court. The presiding judge, Mathias McGirk, reversed the decision of the Crawford County circuit court, citing numerous irregularities in both her indictment and the trial process.[4] Mary was re-indicted and a new trial was scheduled. It was originally supposed to be held in Gasconade County, but was later shifted back to Crawford County. The second trial returned the same verdict as the first, and Mary was hanged at Steelville on August 11, 1838.[5]\nContemporary newspapers reported Mary's age as either 13 or 14, while a later account in a history of Crawford County gave it as 16. The trial judge, James Evans, had instructed the jury to consider whether Mary was above the age of criminal responsibility (14), or whether she was below that age but \"had sufficient mind to know what act would be a crime\". In any case, Mary is generally considered to be the youngest person to have been executed by the state of Missouri.[3]\n",

Over the course of the protests multiple people were struck by cars sending at least one to the hospital. At times, protesters moved into the intersection and surrounded cars. KBIA reporters noted that bricks and rocks were thrown into the street in an effort to disrupt the flow of traffic. On June 7, around 2,000 protesters marched from the Boone County Courthouse in support of Black Lives Matter and George Floyd.[4][5]\nOne June 7, over 300 people marched from the United Nations Peace Plaza to the Harry S. Truman Courthouse to protest the murder of George Floyd. At the courthouse, the protesters held a moment of silence for eight minutes and forty-six seconds.[6]\nOn June 1, an estimated 2,000 people went to the Missouri State Capitol to protest the murder of George Floyd. At one point members of the protest threw water bottles at Jefferson City police officers. A few businesses had their windows broken as well.[7]\nOn May 30, dozens of protesters gathered at 7th and Range Line Road to protest the George Floyd's murder. The protests continued for at least two more days.[8][9]\nHundreds of protesters marched from the Country Club Plaza to Westport the evening of May 29, where police used pepper spray.[10] Some protesters sat in the middle of the street, closing several streets near the intersection of J.C. Nichols Parkway and Emmanuel Cleaver II Boulevard for hours.[11] Some protesters blocked a window and picked up a type 3 traffic barricade, leading police to believe they would use it to commit violence.[12] On May 30, protesters broke glass windows and vandalized the Country Club Plaza business including, Foot Locker, Victoria's Secret, H&M, The North Face, Cafe Trio, Season's 52, P.F. Chang's and other locations. That same night 5 protesters set a police car on fire.[13] On June 1, 2020 protests grew more violent as protesters threw rocks and water bottles in retaliation to officers attacking protesters with batons leading to many injuries.[14][15][16] As of June 4, there have been more than 230 arrests at the protest. All non-violent charges were dropped by city council ordinance.[17][18]\nAn activist who was arrested after stepping off a sidewalk is suing the officers who used pepper spray on him and his daughter for excessive force.[19] The officer involved was later charged with misdemeanor assault for spraying pepper spray in the teen's face.[20]\n",

        "paragraph": "Lorenzo Jerome Gilyard, Jr. (born May 24, 1950), known as the Kansas City Strangler, is an American serial killer. A former trash-company supervisor, Gilyard is believed to have raped and murdered at least 13 women and girls from 1977 to 1993. He was convicted of six counts of murder on March 16, 2007.[1]\nLorenzo Jerome Gilyard, Jr., was born on May 24, 1950, in Kansas City, Missouri, one of five children born to Lorenzo Gilyard, Sr., and his wife Laura (n\u00e9e Brown). From an early age, Lorenzo exhibited aggressive behavior. During his school years, he played on sports teams with his brothers. As he was larger than most of his peers, he physically assaulted smaller children and earned a reputation as a bully.[2]\nDue to his lack of discipline, poor academic performance, and chronic absenteeism, Lorenzo was forced to drop out of school after the 10th grade. In the mid-1960s, he met a young woman named Rena Hill, with whom he soon began a relationship. On November 20, 1968, Gilyard and Hill married, after the latter learned that she was pregnant. Despite this, Gilyard began to indulge in crime and to exhibit deviant sexual behavior towards women.[3]\nIn January 1969, Gilyard was arrested on charges of assaulting and raping a girl he knew, but was later released when a reconciliation agreement was reached between the two parties, with the victim retracting the charges after Lorenzo apologized to her. In 1970, Gilyard's father was convicted of rape. Two years later, Gilyard himself was arrested again for raping and assaulting another woman, with the victim claiming that he had choked her into unconsciousness. She identified Gilyard as the culprit from a lineup, but her testimony was considered questionable, and the charges were subsequently dropped.\nIn 1973, Gilyard was arrested for assaulting his wife, with Hill telling police that he had been physically and sexually abusive for all the years they had been married. Ultimately, he was forced to pay a fine and to divorce his wife.[3] In February 1974, Gilyard was arrested for raping a 25-year-old exotic dancer who identified him as her attacker from a photograph, but yet again, the charges were dropped when the two parties reached a reconciliation agreement. Five months later, he was arrested again for raping the 13-year-old daughter of a friend on the banks of the Missouri River. As the victim changed her testimony, the rape charges were dropped, but Gilyard was convicted of sexual acts with a minor and received a 9-month sentence in the Jackson County jail. After his release, Gilyard married a second time, but his wife soon left him and filed for divorce, claiming that, like Rena Hill, she was beaten and sexually abused by her husband. In the late 1970s, Gilyard married a third time.\nIn 1979, Gilyard was arrested on charges of assaulting a young couple, raping the girl, and threatening to kill her fianc\u00e9. Despite the fact that the victims identified him as their attacker, Gilyard was acquitted by jury verdict at his September 1980 trial, due to lack of evidence. A few months later, he was arrested for aggravated assault on his third wife, but got away with an administrative fine and a divorce. In February 1981, Gilyard attacked his ex-wife on two separate occasions; in the first one, he knocked out her front teeth, and in the second, he stabbed her in the hand with an ice pick. He was arrested and charged with third-degree assault, but was let go on a suspended sentence and probation.[4] In November 1981, Gilyard was arrested for theft, but was released on $3,500 bail. That same spring, he received a 4-year prison sentence for violating his probation. During his incarceration, his sister, Patricia D. Dixon, a prostitute, was convicted of murdering a client in 1983 and sentenced to 11 years imprisonment, in addition to being implicated in the murder of another prostitute.[3]\nOn January 10, 1983, Gilyard was paroled, but was soon returned to prison, after he was arrested in Wyandotte County, Kansas, for making bomb threats. He was released again in late 1985, and in January 1986, he got a job as a garbage man at the Deffenbaugh Disposal Service, where his father worked in the maintenance department. On December 23, 1987, Gilyard was arrested and interrogated as a potential suspect in the murder of 36-year-old Sheila Ingold, during which his blood sample was taken, but was released due to lack of evidence.[5] In 1991, Gilyard married for a fourth time, and was promoted to company supervisor, granting him control of several garbage-disposal teams in various parts of Kansas City. In July 1996, Gilyard's neighbor went to the police, claiming that she had been sexually harassed by him since September 1995; no charges were brought against him, and the woman moved away soon after. Aside from this incident, Gilyard is not known to have committed any crimes after 1993, with his friends and acquaintances speaking of him in a positive manner.[5]\nIn 2001, the Kansas City Police Department received a multimillion-dollar federal grant, aimed at re-examining cold cases using new DNA technology.[6] After examining the blood sample taken from Lorenzo Gilyard, the investigation team conclusively connected him to the murders of six women in the area, including Sheila Ingold, for whose murder he was considered a suspect back in 1987. In addition to this, he was also linked through circumstantial evidence to the killings of at least six more women, killed between April 1977 and January 1993: all of them were between the ages of 15 and 36, and were strangled with various items, including nylon stockings, laces, and wire.[5] Their bodies were found dumped in various areas around Kansas City, in landfills, snowdrifts, abandoned buildings, vans, fields, and parking lots.[7] All but one were known prostitutes; nine were found either fully or partially naked, and 11 were sexually assaulted. The murders were considered unrelated until 1994, when police forensically linked two of them to each other.[7] As a result of these findings, Gilyard was arrested on April 16, 2004, and charged with 12 counts of first-degree murder.[5][6]\nAfter his arrest, Gilyard was charged with these murders:[8]\n",

Thousands of people attended a candlelight vigil for Hailey on February 23, 2014. A neighborhood park was later dedicated to her called Hailey's Playground. Her family and friends also advocated for improvements to the state's AMBER Alert system, ultimately leading to the 2019 passage of HAILEY'S Law, which empowers law enforcement officers to issue alerts more quickly and to include a URL with each AMBER alert.[3]\nHailey was born to parents Stacey Barfield and Ryan Owens in Springfield, Missouri. Hailey was a fourth grader at Westport Elementary at the time of her death. In a news interview, Hailey's mother said she enjoyed helping her babysit and loved little kids. Her mother also stated that Hailey was always smiling, laughing, and willing to help anyone in any way she could.[4]\nAt about 5:00\u00a0p.m. on February 18, 2014, Hailey was walking home from a friend's house when a man in a truck pulled over, called to her, and asked for directions. As she approached him, he grabbed her, threw her into his truck, and sped away. Michelle and Carlos Edwards were talking in their garage when they saw a gold Ford Ranger truck pull up, and the driver grabbed Hailey. Michelle wrote down the license plate number, and Carlos ran after the truck while another neighbor jumped in a vehicle and followed until the truck eluded him. \nAs Michelle called 911, Carlos knocked on doors trying to find the girl's parents, the search warrant application said. He described the girl to a boy who said it sounded like his sister and took Carlos to his home to talk with his mother. The license plate number led police to Jim and Regina Wood, who informed them that their son Craig Wood was the primary driver of that vehicle.\nHailey's body was found in Craig Michael Wood's home in Springfield. It was inside two garbage bags within plastic storage containers in the basement of the house. She had been raped and shot in the back of the head.[5] There were marks on her wrists indicating that, at some point, she had been tied up.[6] There is video footage of Wood disposing of Hailey's clothing in a dumpster. There is also footage of him buying two bottles of bleach and Liquid Plummer on two separate trips.\nThe suspect in the murder was Craig Michael Wood (born March 25, 1968).[7] He was 49 years old at the time of his conviction. Wood once worked in Springfield as a paraprofessional worker and worked for 16 years as a school football coach at Pleasant View Middle School.[6] He also worked there supervising suspensions and as a teacher's aide and substitute teacher.[8]\nPolice found over a dozen firearms in his home, as well as child pornography.[8] While searching a bedroom dresser in Wood's home, they discovered stories about sexual fantasies. Two of these handwritten stories involved girls aged 13. Also found were four pictures of young female students who attended the school where Wood had been employed.[9]\nWood had a criminal record. In 1990, he pleaded guilty and was fined $100 after being found in possession of a controlled substance. In 2001, he was convicted of the misdemeanor of stealing wildlife.[8]\n",

In the 1920 census, the family is described as mulatto.[1] In the 1930 census, Raymond Gunn is described as laborer and widower.[2]\nIn September 1925, Gunn was convicted of the attempted rape of a student at what is now Northwest Missouri State University, after accosting the young woman on a rural lane outside of Maryville. The student claimed that Gunn stuck his thumbs into her mouth to keep her from screaming. Gunn never confessed to the crime, and he claimed to have been beaten while in custody. He was released on January 28, 1928.\nFollowing his release, Gunn married a local woman and moved with her to Omaha. However, his wife died of pneumonia, and he returned to Maryville, where he made a living as a hunter.[3]\nOn December 16, 1930, a 20-year-old teacher, Velma Colter, daughter of a local farmer, was murdered in the one-room Garrett schoolhouse, (40\u00b019\u203256.22\u2033N 94\u00b054\u203240.05\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff40.3322833\u00b0N 94.9111250\u00b0W\ufeff / 40.3322833; -94.9111250) a mile southwest of Maryville. When she failed to return home, her parents went to the school. They found her partly undressed body in a pool of blood inside the school; a bloody footprint left by her killer was on the floor.[3]\nBecause of his earlier conviction, Raymond Gunn was immediately suspected. A farmer reported he had seen a black man near the school. The sheriff arrested several black men matching the description, before he found Gunn on December 18. Gunn had blood stains on his shirt (he claimed it was rabbit blood), and his footprint matched the one at the crime scene. Moreover, Gunn had a severe bite mark on his thumb, recalling the student's description of the 1925 rape attempt.[3]\nGunn finally confessed, saying he had entered the school with a hedge club after seeing the teacher outside with a coal bucket. She resisted his assault, biting his thumb, so he hit her with the club. She struck him with the coal bucket, and he hit her again and again, killing her. He then stabbed her.[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nAntislavery settler victory\nBleeding Kansas, Bloody Kansas, or the Border War was a series of violent civil confrontations in Kansas Territory, and to a lesser extent in western Missouri, between 1854 and 1859. It emerged from a political and ideological debate over the legality of slavery in the proposed state of Kansas.\nThe conflict was characterized by years of electoral fraud, raids, assaults, and murders carried out in the Kansas Territory and neighboring Missouri by proslavery \"border ruffians\" and antislavery \"free-staters\". According to Kansapedia of the Kansas Historical Society, 56 political killings were documented during the period,[2] and the total may be as high as 200.[3] It has been called a Tragic Prelude, or an overture, to the American Civil War, which immediately followed it.\nThe conflict centered on the question of whether Kansas, upon gaining statehood, would join the Union as a slave state or a free state. The question was of national importance because Kansas's two new senators would affect the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, which was bitterly divided over the issue of slavery. The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act of 1854 called for popular sovereignty: the decision about slavery would be made by popular vote of the territory's settlers rather than by legislators in Washington. Existing sectional tensions surrounding slavery quickly found focus in Kansas.[4][5]\nMissouri, a slave state since 1821, was populated by many settlers with Southern sympathies and proslavery views, some of whom tried to influence the Kansas decision by entering Kansas and claiming to be residents. The conflict was fought politically, as well as between civilians, where it eventually degenerated into brutal gang violence and paramilitary guerrilla warfare. The term \"Bleeding Kansas\" was popularized by Horace Greeley's New-York Tribune.[6][a]\nKansas had a state-level civil war that would soon be replicated on a national basis. It had two different capitals (proslavery Lecompton and antislavery Lawrence and Topeka), two different constitutions (the proslavery Lecompton Constitution and the antislavery Topeka Constitution), and two different legislatures (the so-called \"bogus legislature\" in Lecompton and the antislavery body in Lawrence). Both sides sought and received help from outside, the proslavery side from the federal government; Presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan openly helped the proslavery partisans. Both claimed to reflect the will of the people of Kansas. The proslavers used violence and threats of violence, and the free-soilers responded in kind. After much commotion, including a congressional investigation, it became clear that a majority of Kansans wanted Kansas to be a free state, but this required congressional approval, which Southerners in Congress blocked.\nKansas was admitted to the Union as a free state the same day that enough Southern senators had departed, during the secession crisis that led to the Civil War, to allow it to pass (effective January 29, 1861). Partisan violence continued along the Kansas\u2013Missouri border for most of the war, though Union control of Kansas was never seriously threatened. Bleeding Kansas demonstrated that armed conflict over slavery was unavoidable. Its severity made national headlines, which suggested to the American people that the sectional disputes were unlikely to be resolved without bloodshed, and it, therefore, acted as a preface to the American Civil War.[8] The episode is commemorated with numerous memorials and historic sites.\nAs abolitionism became increasingly popular in the United States and tensions between its supporters and detractors grew, the U.S. Congress maintained a tenuous balance of political power between Northern and Southern representatives. At the same time, the increasing emigration of Americans to the country's western frontier and the desire to build a transcontinental railroad that would connect the eastern states with California urged incorporation of the western territories into the Union. The inevitable question was how these territories would treat the issue of slavery when eventually promoted to statehood. This question had already plagued Congress during political debates following the Mexican\u2013American War. The Compromise of 1850 had at least temporarily solved the problem by permitting residents of the Utah and New Mexico Territories to decide their own laws with respect to slavery by popular vote, an act which set a new precedent in the ongoing debate over slavery.[8]\n",

O'Neal, who was serving a life sentence for the robbery and murder of 78-year-old Ralph Roscoe Sharick, stabbed Dade to death at the Missouri State Penitentiary. For the latter murder, O'Neal was sentenced to death and executed in 1995 at the Potosi Correctional Center via lethal injection.[2] O'Neal is notable for being the only white person to be executed for killing a black person in the history of modern Missouri.[3][4]\nOn July 6, 1979, O'Neal and his accomplice, John E. Boggs, broke into the home of Doctor J. Larry Dowell in Strafford, Missouri. While burglarizing the home, Dowell's father-in-law, 78-year-old Ralph Roscoe Sharick, who lived in a trailer home behind the house, entered the property after hearing a disturbance. After confronting O'Neal and Boggs, Sharick was bound and placed into a chair in a closet. After stealing a saxophone, a guitar, and a couple of guns, O'Neal fired four shots with a .22 caliber gun into the closet, one of which fatally struck Sharick in the chest. His body was found later that night by Dowell when he returned home.[5][6]\nBoggs was captured and arrested two days later in Fort Worth, Texas.[7] O'Neal remained a fugitive and became the subject of a multi-state manhunt. On August 25, 1979, he was captured in Enid, Oklahoma, after police received a tip from an area truck stop operator. He was found sleeping in a stolen truck and had been working in the Enid area.[8] O'Neal was held without bail in the Greene County Jail. He was charged with capital murder, first-degree burglary, stealing, and armed criminal action.[9] On August 27, O'Neal waived extradition and was returned to Springfield, Missouri.[10]\nO'Neal and Boggs both pleaded innocent to all charges.[11] Each accused the other of pulling the trigger.[5] On January 24, 1980, O'Neal was convicted of first-degree murder. On February 22, 1980, he was sentenced to life in prison by Circuit Judge James H. Keet. O'Neal was then transported to the Missouri State Penitentiary to serve his sentence.[12] For his role in the crime, Boggs also received a life sentence. He was eventually granted parole but was barred from ever returning to Greene County.[5]\nWhile serving life in prison, O'Neal became a member of the white supremacist group, the Aryan Brotherhood,[13] and was affiliated with the Aryan Nations.[14] On February 3, 1984, at noon, 33-year-old Arthur Dade, a black American man serving a twenty-two-year sentence at the Missouri State Penitentiary for two armed robbery convictions in 1979, was attacked by three white inmates.[15] O'Neal, accompanied by fellow inmates Lloyd Schlup and Rodnie Stewart, attacked Dade in a prison hallway outside the prison dining hall. Dade had been released from his cell to eat his noon meal.[16] Schlup allegedly held Dade's arms, while Stewart threw hot liquid in Dade's face to distract him.[17] O'Neal then stabbed Dade to death with a homemade ice pick.[18][19] Dade was stabbed four or five times in the chest and once in his right arm. He was pronounced dead by prison physicians twenty minutes later.[20] Both Dade and O'Neal were residents of the Special Management Unit, which was a special prison inside the Missouri State Penitentiary. The unit was used for the confinement of 400 of the most troublesome inmates.[21]\nO'Neal, Schlup, and Stewart were each charged with capital murder in the killing of Dade. Prosecutors called the killing a well-planned \"Aryan hit.\"[22] O'Neal tried claiming that he had killed Dade in self-defense.[23] Ultimately, all three suspects were found guilty. O'Neal and Schlup were sentenced to death, while Stewart was sentenced to life in prison.[17] Schlup's death sentence was overturned in 1999 following Schlup v.

I forgive everybody involved in this. Jesus is my Lord.\"[29] He clutched a bible to his chest during the execution.[30][31] He declined a last meal and instead fasted all day on the day before his execution.[32]\nO'Neal's execution marked the rare occasion of a white person being executed for killing a black person.[33][34] He remains the only white person to have been executed for killing a black person in the history of modern Missouri.[3] Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in the United States in 1976, only 21 white people have been executed for murdering a black victim (less than 1.4 percent of all executions).[4][35]\n",

        "paragraph": "Michael Herbert Singh (born Rupert Sookman; February 25, 1945 \u2013 March 30, 2005) was a Trinidad and Tobago-born American serial killer who killed a girlfriend and two wives in New Mexico and Missouri from 1975 to 1982. Found not guilty by reason of insanity for the final murder, he was detained at a mental health clinic until 2005, when he was stabbed to death by a fellow inmate.\nRupert Sookman was born on February 25, 1945, in Trinidad and Tobago, one of seven children born to Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian parents. Little is known of his upbringing, but after finishing high school, he worked as an elementary and high school teacher before he and his family moved to Denver, Colorado, to avoid discrimination from the majority ethnic African population in Trinidad and Tobago.[1] Shortly after the move, Sookman enlisted in the United States Army and fought during the Vietnam War, but was honorably discharged and returned to Denver, where he opened a clothing store. He later re-enlisted in the Army, but later left as he had difficulties adjusting and because his business had failed, leaving him without an income.[1] Sookman then moved to Los Angeles, California, and changed his name to Michael Herbert Singh, but the exact date or reason for the name change is unclear.\nSometime in 1975, Singh began a relationship with 16-year-old Candace Lynn Starr, but it was quickly soured by his violent behavior towards her and she eventually dumped him. Angered by this, he kidnapped her at gunpoint from her home in Los Angeles on September 21, dragging her into his van while Starr's two younger sisters watched in horror.[2] For the next few days, Singh kept his ex-girlfriend as a hostage until they eventually wound up at a convenience store in Gallup, New Mexico. There, he drew a gun and shot Starr, killing her on the spot.[2]\nImmediately afterward, Singh got into his van and fled, but not before some witnesses were able to get a partial view of his face and the color of his van. This information was later relayed to the authorities, but as they were unable to gather more evidence or identify the victim, the case quickly went cold and was left unsolved for decades. Starr remained unidentified until November 2009, when her DNA was submitted to CODIS and subsequently matched her profile on The Doe Network.[2]\nFollowing Starr's murder, Singh moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he soon married 29-year-old Mary Ann Spain, a divorc\u00e9e with two children who worked as an operating room technician at the Cox Medical Center.[3] Like with his previous relationship, Singh quickly became violent towards his newlywed spouse, which led to frequent arguments between the two. During one such argument on September 23, 1976, Singh pulled out a gun and shot Mary in front of her house before fleeing in his car. The murder was noticed by both of her children, with her 5-year-old daughter quickly alerting the neighbors, who in turn informed the police. An autopsy determined that Mrs. Singh had been shot once in the chin at close range, with three additional shots being fired into her chest and left arm.[3]\nSingh was arrested later that day along Route 63, not far from Houston. Upon inspecting his car, the officer located a pistol, and during questioning, Singh presented himself as an unemployed construction worker and listed his wife's home as his address. He was then extradited back to Missouri, where he was held on second-degree murder and $75,000 bail.[3] Before his arraignment, Singh petitioned to have his prison diet changed to a vegetarian one, a request that was subsequently granted by the court.[4]\nInitially, Singh's trial was scheduled to start in March 1977, but due to a violent outburst during a hearing which required that the defendant be restrained by seven bailiffs, the presiding judge ordered that the proceedings should be adjourned until Singh could get a second evaluation.[5] The previous day, he had shown signs of increasing agitation, paced around the courtroom and even uttered obscenities under his breath.[6] When psychiatrists at the Fulton State Hospital deemed Singh sane, his trial date was pushed back to August 1.[7]\nIn July, Singh filed a petition to have Circuit Judge James H. Keet disqualified from the proceedings, citing alleged prejudice against him. In response, Keet staunchly refused, filing a ruling explaining his decision.[8] In response, Singh attempted to have his trial delayed again, claiming that he suffered from a physical ailment that prevented him from fully concentrating during the proceedings, but his request was denied.[9]\nDuring the trial, prosecutors brought Mrs. Singh's two children as the primary witnesses, allowing her daughter to describe what she had seen and heard on the day of her mother's murder. In her testimony, the girl described how Singh and Mary had gotten into a heated argument that eventually resulted in the former shooting the latter and then leaving.[10] A forensic pathologist, A.C. Raborar, was later brought in to give a detailed overview of the gunshot wounds, explaining that the bullet that entered through Mrs. Singh's back traveled upward towards her heart, killing her instantly.[11] When he took the stand, Singh and his attorney claimed that Mary, who was taller and stronger than her husband, was the aggressive and domineering one in their relationship and that she was the one who had attacked him first, resulting in her accidental death. In his testimony, Singh alleged that she was a closeted bisexual who had several girlfriends and claimed that she had attempted to force him into having relationships with men, which he was categorically opposed to.[12] These claims were repudiated by family members and witnesses, including the police officer who arrested Singh, as he testified that shortly after his detention, the defendant had asked whether Missouri carried the death penalty for murder.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nAnthony Lamar Smith was a 24-year-old African American man from St. Louis, Missouri, who was shot and killed by then St. Louis Police officer Jason Stockley following a car chase on December 20, 2011.[1] On September 15, 2017, Stockley was found not guilty of first-degree murder, and protests erupted in St. Louis.[2]\nSmith was previously convicted for drug distribution and unlawful possession of a firearm, and was out on probation for a theft charge at the time of the incident.[3]  Police officer Stockley and his partner have stated they saw Smith engaged in a drug deal.  Dashcam footage from their police cruiser recorded Smith reversing his car into their vehicle twice before driving off.  A car chase lasting three minutes ensued, ending when Stockley's partner, on Stockley's recommendation, rammed Smith's car.[2]  Stockley was recorded during the chase as saying \"going to kill this motherfucker, don\u2019t you know it\".[1] After the car was stopped, Stockley and his partner, Brian Bianchi, approached Smith's vehicle at West Florissant and Acme Avenues in north St. Louis.[4] Witnesses testified and dashcam footage showed that Stockley yelled at Smith through the driver side window of Smith's vehicle to open the door. Stockley testified that Smith did not comply but rather appeared to be reaching around the interior of his vehicle in search of something which Stockley believed to be a gun. Stockley testified that Smith's demeanor suddenly changed, which Stockley believed indicated that Smith had found the alleged gun. Stockley then opened fire through the window and shot five times, killing Smith. The judge's ruling in subsequent criminal case found that  the \"[a]fter Smith is removed from the Buick, Stockley gets in on the driver's side;...The evidence at trial was that Stockley got into the car to search for a weapon, and Stockley testified that he found a handgun tucked between the seat and center console.\"[5][2]  In 2013 the St. Louis police board settled a wrongful death suit with Smith's survivors for $900,000.[6]\nJason Stockley was charged by St. Louis City prosecutors with first-degree murder in May 2016. He was arrested at his home in Houston, Texas.[7]\nDuring the trial, the prosecution had argued that the revolver found in Smith's car had been planted by Stockley to justify the shooting.  However, in his ruling, St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson said the prosecution's argument was not supported by the evidence.[6]  DNA experts testified that the gun recovered had no trace of Smith's DNA on it, and Stockley's DNA was present.[3][8] The only DNA found on the gun in Smith\u2019s car had a profile similar to Stockley\u2019s, but, as the prosecution said, that does not conclusively prove that Smith did not touch the gun.[8] Judge Wilson stated he found it difficult to believe the gun was concealed and planted by Stockley given the entire incident was on video and Stockley was not wearing a jacket. Wilson also noted Smith's DNA was found on the heroin in the car and that during his 28 years on the bench \"an urban heroin dealer not in possession of a firearm would be an anomaly.\" Before this case, the judge had \"ruled both for and against police during his 28 years on the bench.\" Defense lawyers and prosecutors interviewed by the Associated Press described him as \"objective and well-respected\".[9]\nPrior to the verdict, a group of clergy publicly stated that an acquittal would result in \"mass disruption\" in the city.[10] Missouri Governor Eric Greitens, who was openly critical of his predecessor Jay Nixon's response to the Ferguson unrest, preemptively activated the Missouri National Guard and scheduled 12-hour shifts for the St. Louis Municipal Police.[11]\nOn September 15, 2017 protests erupted when Stockley was found not guilty of murder.[12] Some of the protests turned violent. After declaring the protests an \"unlawful assembly\", police officers were pelted with water bottles and rocks.[13] Protesters also descended upon mayor Lyda Krewson's home, and threw bricks at and vandalized it. Police deployed tear gas to break up the crowd and two officers were injured by bricks thrown by protesters. Over the night, ten police officers were injured and thirty-two protesters were arrested.[13]\nProtesters in attendance reported not hearing an order of dispersal before tear gas, and an estimated 250 people who took shelter in a nearby synagogue described being \"held hostage\" under threat of arrest.[14]\nThe next day, the band U2 and singer Ed Sheeran both cancelled their weekend concerts in St. Louis out of safety concerns over ongoing protests.[15] Protests during this day were largely peaceful, as demonstrators marched through two nearby shopping malls and into the streets.[16] However, a small group of protesters at the Delmar Loop in St. Louis refused to disperse after the police asked them to leave. These protesters broke windows and threw objects at the police, who arrested nine people.[17]\n",

        "paragraph": "Todd Gordon Ewen  (March 22, 1966 \u2013 September 19, 2015) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played for several teams in the National Hockey League (NHL).[1] A right wing, Ewen was primarily known as an enforcer.[1] He played for the St. Louis Blues, Montreal Canadiens, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and San Jose Sharks.[1] Ewen retired with 1,914 penalty minutes, putting him 61st for all-time career penalty minutes. He was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and raised in St. Albert, Alberta. Ewen won the Stanley Cup in 1993 with the Canadiens.\nAfter leaving his professional career Ewen made several coaching videos with Championship Productions. He also was coaching director for the Chesterfield Hockey Association, Lafayette Varsity head coach and assistant coach for the Saint Louis University Billikens.\nIn 2015, after allegedly suffering from depression for several years, Ewen took his own life. His family wondered if he might have endured chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) as a result of concussions he had sustained during his playing career, like some other recently deceased NHL enforcers. Although initial tests of his brain came back negative for CTE, subsequent examinations completed by Boston University medical staff did confirm the existence of lesions consistent with stage 2 CTE.[2]\nAs a youth, Ewen played in the 1979 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from St. Albert, Alberta.[3]\nEwen started his junior career with the Kamloops Junior Oilers at age 16. He started the season in Kamloops but was traded to the Nanaimo Lakers at the end of the season. That was the last year that the team was in Nanaimo and they then moved back to New Westminster. Ewen played three years for the New Westminster Bruins of the Western Hockey League (WHL), where he was awarded the most improved player by the WHL and served as his team's assistant captain.  At New Westminster, Ewen was teammates with future NHL players Mark Recchi, Bill Ranford, Cliff Ronning and Brian Noonan, as well as with his younger brother Dean, who went on to be a career minor league enforcer.[citation needed]\nIn his last year with the Bruins Ewen had 6 points and over 200 minutes in penalties by Christmas. Oilers head scout Barry Fraser flew in to see Ewen's performance.  Ewen ended up with 52 points and 289 minutes in penalties. When the season ended with New Westminster, Ewen was loaned to the Maine Mariners for the playoffs. He centered a line which had Archie Henderson and Mitch Wilson as line mates. He was selected by the Edmonton Oilers in the eighth round, 168th overall, of the 1984 draft.\nEwen never played for the Oilers but was called up to the team for the 1985 Stanley Cup playoffs.[1] At the beginning of the next season, Ewen was assigned to the minors in Nova Scotia where he had a run-in with coach Larry Kish. He was later traded to the St. Louis Blues.\nHe played parts of four years with St. Louis and had one of his most memorable fights, with Bob Probert.[1] In his second fight in the National Hockey League, he knocked out Probert with one punch. This was the first of several battles with Probert. He was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in 1990 in their attempt to add an enforcer to the team for a Stanley Cup run. He played four seasons for Montreal, which culminated in a Stanley Cup championship in 1993. Before the start of the 1994 season, he was traded to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim after the expansion draft and was the first trade made by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim along with Patrik Carnback. He spent the next three seasons protecting the team's star players, Paul Kariya and Teemu Sel\u00e4nne, along with his partner, Stu Grimson. During this time with the Mighty Ducks, Ewen served as the assistant captain for all three years. The Mighty Ducks achieved a record for the winningest expansion franchise team in NHL history. After three years with the Mighty Ducks, Ewen joined the San Jose Sharks as a free agent in 1996\u201397, his last season in the NHL. His career ended with double knee surgery. He attended camp with the Phoenix Coyotes, but officially retired after suffering a knee injury in camp.\nEwen was involved in coaching after his retirement. Having moved back to St. Louis, he became involved in the local Chesterfield Hockey Association and was the coaching director for three years. He also was involved in doing coaching seminars with USA hockey for levels 1-3 along with other St Louis Blues alumni Rob Ramage, Mike Zuke and Rick Zombo. During his tenure with Chesterfield hockey, Ewen was the head coach for every level from mini-mite to midget major central states. The opportunity to get involved in high school hockey was a welcome change and Ewen moved to Lafayette High School for three years.\n",

He and his wife were both convicted for first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Zein Isa died of diabetes before he could be executed. Maria Isa was later resentenced to life imprisonment and died in prison.\nPalestina Zein Isa, named after Palestine, was born on December 6, 1972 in Mato Grosso, Brazil.[2] The youngest of seven siblings, she lived in a southern portion of the City of St. Louis in an apartment complex,[3] and attended Dewey Junior High School[4] and Roosevelt High School in Saint Louis. Her father was a Muslim Palestinian, Zein Isa, who originated from Beitin, West Bank.[1] Her mother, Maria Isa, was Brazilian and a Roman Catholic.[1] As a result Tina was of German, Italian, Palestinian, and some indigenous South American descent.[5] She learned Arabic and Portuguese from her parents and Spanish during her time living in Puerto Rico.[6]\nZein al-Abdeen Hassan Isa,[7] born on June 3, 1931, was the third son of a farmer.[8] While a teenager, he married a woman named Foiziya, his double first cousin.[9] In the 1950s, Zein left Palestine,[10] emigrating with members of neighboring families.[8] He first lived in the south of Brazil and, while on a business trip to Rondon\u00f3polis, Mato Grosso, met Maria Matias (born August 10, 1943), a native of Mato Grosso who had been born in Santa Catarina. She was of German, Italian, and South American native descent.[11]\nOn February 6, 1963, the two married despite the opposition of Maria's parents.[12] Zein did not reveal to Maria that she was his second wife until after they had married.[13] They moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in fall 1963, then to Paterson, New Jersey, Arecibo, Puerto Rico, back to Rondon\u00f3polis, then to C\u00e1ceres, Mato Grosso;[14] Tina was born in Mato Grosso.[2]\nThe family moved back to Puerto Rico, living in Arecibo until moving to Isabela one year later. During this time, the father, without the mother, lived with his children in the West Bank for periods of time.[15]\nIn 1980, Zein became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[16] The entire family moved to Beitin in the West Bank when Tina was five.[17] The family came to St. Louis around 1986[16] and owned a grocery store there.[18] Tina began learning English after arriving in St. Louis,[4] where her friends gave her the nickname \"Tina\".[19] In 1991, Tim Bryant of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote in regards to the parents, \"Neither speaks English well.\"[16]\nTina's relationship with her father deteriorated after she turned fourteen; in earlier years they had enjoyed a closer relationship.[20] She listened to American popular music such as hip hop,[1] dance, rap, R&B, and rock.[citation needed] Tina Isa's ambition was to become a pilot after taking aeronautical engineering courses;[3] she intended to do this at Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology (part of St. Louis University).[21] Zein wanted to arrange Tina as a marriage partner to a man from his hometown.[1] Isa's elder sisters stated their dislike of her lifestyle. Her family sent people to extract her from a prom dance she attended.[16] When her family learned that she, since January 1989, was engaged in a romantic relationship with a 20-year-old African-American, Cliff Walker, Tina's parents grew even angrier.\n[22] Zein Isa held grudges against African-Americans because he believed Palestinian businesspeople had been targeted by black criminals.[23]\nPrior to his daughter's murder, Zein made telephone calls stating that Tina had damaged the honor of his family and needed to die. On the day of her death, she worked her first day at a Wendy's fast food restaurant;[22] the family also opposed the idea of her not working for the family's grocery business.[18] Ellen Harris, author of Guarding the Secrets, wrote that \"The problem was that Tina thought of herself as American or hyphenated-American, not as Arab.\"[24]\nHer murder took place at the Delor Park Apartments, in her family's residence.[21] Isa's boyfriend walked her home after the first day of her job. Initially, her parents criticized her for having the outside job and later stated a belief that she was doing something else instead of working. Zein Isa stabbed his daughter with a boning knife. One of her lungs, her liver, and her heart were severely damaged by six blows to her chest. Maria Isa assisted Zein by holding Tina.[22] FBI agents were not at the surveillance unit when the killing happened.[18]\nTina Isa was buried at Sacred Heart Cemetery in Florissant, Missouri, reportedly in a bridal gown. Her Brazilian mother said unmarried girls and women in Brazil who die are buried accordingly. The family intentionally did not provide notice of the funeral to the media to ensure that only people from the family, the local Palestinian community and people from Beitin attended. They expressly did not want Tina's boyfriend to attend. FBI agents secretly monitored and photographed the proceedings.[25]\n",

Scott found fame with Bob Kuban and The In-Men in 1966 with his lead vocals on the song \"(Look Out For) The Cheater.\"  \"The Cheater\" spent eleven weeks on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 12 on 12\u201319 March 1966.[2]  Scott left the group soon after to attempt a solo career. When this failed, Scott began touring with a cover band during the 1970s.[3]  In early 1983, Scott and Kuban performed together for a television appearance, and they planned to reunite the band for their twentieth anniversary in June 1983.[4]\nScott disappeared on December 27, 1983. In April 1987, his body was found floating face-down in a cistern. He had been hog-tied and shot in the chest (Forensic Files reported that he was shot in the back).

        "paragraph": "\nThe Temple Lot, located in Independence, Missouri, is the first site to be dedicated for the construction of a temple in the  Latter Day Saint movement. The area was dedicated on August 3, 1831, by the movement's founder, Joseph Smith Jr.,[1] and purchased on December 19, 1831, by his colleague Edward Partridge to be the center of the New Jerusalem or \"City of Zion\" after he received a revelation stating that it would be the gathering spot of the Latter Day Saints during the last days.[2]\nThe most prominent 2.5-acre (1.0\u00a0ha) section of the Temple Lot is currently an open, grass-covered field occupied in its northeast corner by a few trees and the headquarters of the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), which is not considered a temple by adherents of that sect. No other structures (with the exception of monuments, markers and signposts) exist on the 2.5-acre (1.0\u00a0ha) section, although numerous important structures exist on the 63.5-acre (25.7\u00a0ha) section, such as the United Nations Peace Plaza, the Community of Christ Auditorium, the Truman Railroad Depot, the LDS Visitors Center, the Community of Christ Temple, an LDS Church stake center,[3] and the Six Nations Tree of Peace.\nThe city of Independence, Missouri, became important to the Latter Day Saint movement starting in the autumn of 1830, only a few months after the religion was incorporated in the state of New York in April 1830. The movement's founder, Joseph Smith, had said he had received revelations designating this city as the \"Center Place\" of \"Zion\",[4] and many early adherents apparently believed that the Garden of Eden had been located there\u2014including later LDS Church leaders Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball, who said he was told this by Joseph Smith. Alexander Majors, who was a sixteen-year-old resident of Independence in 1831, wrote in his memoirs:[5]\nNothing of very great note occurred in the county of Jackson, after the cyclone of 1826, until the year 1830, when five Mormon elders made their appearance in the county and commenced preaching, stating to their audiences that they were chosen by the priesthood which had been organized by the prophet Joseph Smith...They selected a place near Independence, Jackson County, Mo., in the early part of the year 1831 which they named Temple Lot, a beautiful spot of ground on a high eminence. They there stuck down their Jacob's staff, as they called it, and said: \"This spot is the center of the earth. This is the place where the Garden of Eden, in which Adam and Eve resided, was located, and we are sent here according to the directions of the angel that appeared to our prophet, Joseph Smith, and told him this is the spot of ground on which the New Jerusalem is to be built, and, when finished, Christ Jesus is to make his reappearance and dwell in this city of New Jerusalem with the saints for a thousand years, at the end of which time there will be a new deal with reference to the nations of the earth, and the final wind-up of the career of the human family.\"However, since Smith never issued an official revelation to the effect that Independence and the Temple Lot were the site of the Garden of Eden, Latter Day Saints (other than some adherents of the LDS Church) traditionally do not formally accept this claim as doctrine.[6] While Smith later issued a revelation indicating a spot named Adam-ondi-Ahman (fifty miles to the north of Independence) as the place Adam and Eve went to after being expelled from the Garden, he never officially confirmed or denied the idea that Independence had been the location of Eden itself.\nAlthough Smith had designated the Temple Lot site as the heart of his new City of Zion, the Latter Day Saints were expelled from Jackson County (late 1833) and later from Missouri (early 1839) before a temple could be constructed. Ownership of the property later became the subject of court challenges among some sects of the Latter Day Saint movement that arose from the succession crisis following Smith's assassination, most notably between the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) and the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church). In 1891, the RLDS Church, presided over by Smith's son Joseph Smith III, sued in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri to take possession of the property. It won in lower court, but lost in the United States Court of Appeals. The United States Supreme Court refused to review the case.[7]\nThe Temple Lot is currently owned by the small Church of Christ (Temple Lot), which acquired the land in 1867. This organization made a failed effort in 1929 to build a temple of its own on the property,[8] which represents to date the only attempt to erect such a structure since the time of Joseph Smith. Currently this body has its headquarters on the site, which has twice been damaged by arson attacks. The Temple Lot church has insisted since about 1976 (when final attempts at conciliation by the RLDS Church took place) that it will not cooperate with other Latter Day Saint or Christian denominations in building a temple, nor will it sell the Lot, regardless of any price that might conceivably be offered.[2] Some members of other Latter Day Saint groups have described the Temple Lot church as \"'squatters' on the location,\"[9] but that organization steadfastly defends its right to possess the property as its physical and spiritual \"custodian\".[10]\nThe Community of Christ (formerly the RLDS Church), the second-largest church within the modern Latter Day Saint movement, now owns the bulk of the original 63-acre (25\u00a0ha) property around the Temple Lot, often referred to as the greater Temple Lot. This land had been purchased in the 1830s by Latter Day Saint bishop Edward Partridge to be the central common and sacred area according to the Plat of Zion. It maintains its world headquarters in this area, opening its Auditorium to the south of the Lot in 1958, while in 1994 it dedicated its Independence Temple just to the east.\n",

He is best known, however, for being a participant in a fatal duel with Major Thomas Biddle. Pettis County, Missouri, is named in his honor.[1]\nSpencer Pettis was born in Culpeper County, Virginia, to parents John and Martha (Reynolds) Pettis in 1802.[citation needed] His father was a veteran of the American Revolution, serving with the 1st Regiment, Virginia Line at the Battle of Guilford Court House and elsewhere.[citation needed] Spencer Pettis' exact date of birth and much about his childhood is unknown. Genealogy records indicate he did have at least two sisters, one of whom, Sally, was the mother of American Civil War naval officer Thornton A. Jenkins. Spencer Pettis received at least enough education to study for the law and become a practicing attorney. Pettis moved west in 1821, settling in central Missouri's Boonslick region, opening a law practice in the Howard County seat of Fayette, Missouri.[2]\nDespite his youth \u2013 he did not meet the minimum age of 24 required by the Missouri Constitution \u2013 Spencer Pettis was elected to the Missouri General Assembly in 1824 by an overwhelming margin.[2] He would serve less than one full term in the legislature however. In July 1826 Missouri Governor John Miller appointed Pettis the Missouri Secretary of State. It was while in that position he became a friend and protege' of U.S. Senator Thomas Hart Benton and an ardent Jacksonian Democrat.[3] Through these new connections Pettis won election in 1828 as Missouri's sole member of the U.S. House of Representatives. At the time most of Missouri's population was centered along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. Pettis, seeking every vote possible, had a large number of handbills printed promoting his campaign and distributed them far and wide across the most remote areas of the state. During his brief time in Congress Pettis cast several votes of some historical interest. Among them were \"aye\" on a bill to continue work on the Cumberland Road and a resolution urging the U.S. President negotiate with other nations for the abolition of the African slave trade.[4] Pettis would be reelected to a second term in Congress in 1830, but by then the die had been cast in a conflict that would rock Missouri politics and take Pettis' life.[5]\nWhat transpired on August 26, 1831, had its roots many months earlier. Missouri's Jacksonian Democrats, led by Senator Thomas Hart Benton, engaged in a number of debates during the 1830 Congressional election season that saw many fiery speeches on issues of banking, currency stability, and western land use. During one of those speeches, Congressman Pettis harshly criticized Nicholas Biddle, President of the Second Bank of the United States.[6] U.S. Army Major Thomas Biddle, a resident of the St. Louis area and brother of Nicholas Biddle, took offense at the remarks.\nA war of words soon ensued in the St. Louis press in the form of letters to the editor. In one such letter, Biddle called Pettis \"a dish of skimmed milk\", to which Pettis responded by questioning Biddle's manhood.[2] Pettis was reelected to U.S. Congress in November 1830, but the feud between the two refused to die. Things escalated dramatically on July 9, 1831, when Thomas Biddle heard that an ill Pettis was resting in a St. Louis hotel. Biddle attacked Pettis in his room, beating him severely with a cowhide whip until other hotel guests intervened. \n[7]\nFearing that he might be attacked again during his recovery, Congressman Pettis had Major Biddle arrested on a peace warrant. At the court proceedings, Pettis attempted to draw a pistol, with the intention of shooting Biddle, but was restrained by friends. At this, Biddle stated that he would promptly accept any challenge that the Congressman cared to issue.[7] After sufficient time to recover from the beating, on August 21, 1831, Congressman Pettis challenged Biddle to a duel, which was promptly accepted. As the challenged party, Biddle was allowed to choose the weapons and distance. Being nearsighted, Major Biddle chose pistols at the unusually close distance of five feet.[6] This meant that each man would take at most one or two steps before turning to fire, with their pistols perhaps even overlapping, depending on arm length. In short, it was suicidal and seen as a ploy by some observers and later historians to make Pettis back down and thus lose the affair of honor without bloodshed.[2]\nAt five p.m. on August 27, 1831, Biddle and Pettis, along with their seconds, Major Benjamin O'Fallon and Captain Martin Thomas respectively, met on Bloody Island, a small sandbar located in the Mississippi River between St. Louis and the Illinois shore. Dueling was illegal in both states, but authorities tended to turn a blind eye to this neutral ground. As large crowds watched from the St. Louis riverfront, Biddle and Pettis obeyed the commands to step, turn, and fire. When the smoke cleared, both men had fallen with mortal wounds.[7] Before being carried off the island, both men were overheard to forgive each other for the altercation. Congressman Spencer Pettis died the next day, while Major Biddle lingered on until August 29. Both men were buried with full honors, eulogized for choosing death before dishonor.[6] The funerals for both men were said to be the largest ever held in St. Louis in the 19th century.\nSpencer Pettis never married and had no children.  William Henry Ashley was elected to finish Pettis's term in the House of Representatives.\n",

        "paragraph": "The rapes and murders of Julie and Robin Kerry occurred on April 5, 1991, on the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in St. Louis, Missouri. The two sisters were raped and then murdered by a group of four males, who also attempted to murder the sisters' cousin.\nMarlin A. Gray (September 29, 1967 \u2013 October 26, 2005) was convicted of aiding and abetting and was executed by the U.S. state of Missouri by lethal injection. His conviction was for being a part of the group of four men involved in the murders. Gray continued to protest his innocence saying that although he was at the bridge at the time, he was smoking cannabis in a nearby car. On December 9, 1992, Gray was convicted of aiding and abetting and was executed on October 26, 2005. He maintained his innocence to the end. In 2017, DNA evidence proved he was an active participant in the crimes.\nOn the night of April 4/morning of April 5, 20-year-old Julie Kerry, 19-year-old Robin Kerry, and their 19-year-old cousin, Thomas Cummins, were on the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River. Gray, Antonio Richardson, Reginald Clemons, and Daniel Winfrey went to the bridge that night together. The two groups, who did not know each other, had a brief conversation. Gray showed the other group how to climb down a manhole cover on the bridge down to the pier. Then the two groups separated.\nAccording to testimony offered on behalf of the prosecution, several minutes later the group of four men decided to rob the three, with Winfrey testifying that Gray said he \"felt like hurting somebody.\" They returned and Gray told Cummins that \"This is a robbery. Get down on the ground.\" The two girls were grabbed and held on the ground. Richardson held Julie down while Clemons raped her and then the two swapped positions. Gray, Richardson, and Clemons then alternately raped Robin and Julie. Cummins was then robbed of his wallet, wristwatch, cash, and keys, and the three victims were forced down the manhole cover to the concrete pier. The two Kerry sisters then were pushed, and Cummins jumped as instructed. Medical witnesses testified that Cummins and Julie Kerry survived the 48-foot (15\u00a0m) fall to the water below. Cummins testified that after surfacing, the current pulled him over to Julie, but then she drifted off after he began to drown. Cummins swam to shore and survived. The body of Julie Kerry was found three weeks later near Caruthersville, Missouri; the body of Robin Kerry was not found.\nGray's version of the events was very different. In an interview in 2005, he said that after parting from the group of three, Gray went to a car where he smoked marijuana, while Richardson went to retrieve a flashlight (stolen by Richardson from a police officer's residence) he had left on the bridge. Gray returned to the bridge 30 minutes later to find that the girls and their cousin were gone. Richardson said that Cummins had said the girls had slipped off the bridge but thought the authorities would not believe this story. Cummins was then robbed by the men of his belongings. The version given by Gray at his trial was different, and also differs from what police said that he told them in his initial interview. On returning after 30 minutes in the car, Clemons informed him that \"Man, I just robbed that guy and threw him and the girls into the river.\"\nPolice initially refused to believe Thomas Cummins' version of the events. They theorized that the other men never existed and he had made up the story to cover up his attempted rape of his cousins. They believed Julie had fallen off the bridge while resisting his sexual advances, Robin had jumped in to save her, and both had drowned. Cummins was initially charged with murder but released due to lack of evidence. He later won a settlement from the St.Louis police department for wrongful interrogation techniques.[1]\nDaniel Winfrey, who was 15 years old at the time, confessed to the murder in the presence of police and his parents. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and forcible rape and testified against the other three in their trials. He received a 30-year sentence. He testified that Clemons and Richardson were the ones who had pushed the two girls. Winfrey was the only white member of the convicted group, which has been raised as a criticism since he was the main prosecution witness.[2]\nWinfrey was granted parole in the summer of 2007; when released, he had served 15 years.\nClemons was sentenced to death but his conviction was overturned in 2015. On December 18th, 2017, Clemons plead guilty to five counts: two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of rape and one count of first degree robbery. He was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. \n",

Indeed, a law in Missouri prohibited people under the age of 21 from attending an execution.[2][3]\nOn July 5, 2005, police officers including William McEntee were looking for Kevin Johnson for an alleged breach of his probation.[4] While searching Johnson's house, his 12-year-old brother, \"Bam Bam\", began having a seizure. The police blocked Johnson's family from providing him with sufficient medical treatment, and he eventually died in hospital.[5][4] Johnson therefore blamed the police, believing that they were indirectely responsible for the death of his little brother.[6] Later that evening, one of those officers, Sgt. William McEntee, 43, returned to Meacham Park. He had offered to take a fireworks complaint from another officer because he was closer to the area. Suddenly, Johnson opened fire on McEntee, hitting him multiple times. McEntee drove a short distance, crashed, and fell out of the car. Johnson walked over and shot him again. McEntee later died in hospital.[7]\nJohnson's lawyers claimed racism played a role in his death sentence, as Johnson was black, and McEntee was white. Additionally, the prosecutor who sought the death penalty against Johnson, Bob McCulloch, requested the death penalty in the police officer murder cases where the defendants were black but did not do so for the only white defendant. The courts rejected the defense and declined to halt the execution.[8] [9]\nJohnson's daughter, 19-year-old Khorry Ramey, asked the courts to allow her to witness her father's execution.[10] Her request was denied, however, after a judge upheld a law that stated Ramey was too young.[11] Missouri law requires a person to be aged 21 or older in order to view an execution.[12]\nJohnson was executed on November 29, 2022, via lethal injection. In his final statement, he apologized to McEntee's family as well as his own. In a first in Missouri execution history, Johnson was accompanied by his spiritual adviser during the execution procedure.[8][13]\n",

Convicted of three murders but suspected in five; he was sentenced to death in both California and Missouri in 1983 and 1984 respectively. He remained on death row at San Quentin State Prison until he was extradited to Missouri in December 1998 to face execution. He was executed in January 1999 at the Potosi Correctional Center via lethal injection.[2]\nMalone was born on January 10, 1961, in Seaside, California.[3] He grew up near Monterey but had relatives in Missouri in the St. Louis area. As such, he moved states and lived there for some time during his youth.[4] He attended Brentwood High School in St. Louis County, where he met Michael Terry Crenshaw. According to Crenshaw, when he first met Malone he was calm, however, after Malone went on a trip to California in 1978, he returned a different person, and wanted to get involved in gang activity.[5]\nOn February 15, 1979, Malone and another man, Andrew R. Armstong, robbed Missouri Court of Appeals judge George F. Gunn Jr. near his home in Brentwood. Armstrong pointed a loaded pistol at Gunn, and the pair stole only $4 in the robbery. Armstrong was sentenced to twenty years after fleeing the state in a stolen car.[6] Malone was sentenced to seven years as he was considered the accomplice in the crime. Malone began his sentence on January 24, 1980, at the Missouri Intermediate Reformatory at the Algoa Correctional Center in Jefferson City.[5]\nDespite being sentenced to seven years, he served just under ten months and was paroled in November 1980. After being released on parole, Malone headed to California. In January 1981, he was convicted of burglary and grand theft in Monterey County. He faced sentencing for the crimes, but while he was awaiting his punishment, he escaped.[5]\nMalone's crime spree began on March 10, 1981, when he kidnapped 37-year-old Leroy Cambs in Santa Maria, California. Malone asked Cambs for a ride and then took out a gun and held him hostage. After forcing Cambs to drive him around for two hours, Malone ordered him into the trunk of his car in an underground parking lot in Los Angeles. Malone then drove Cambs around in the car for an hour before finally letting him go near a freeway in Long Beach. On March 11, Malone robbed a gas station in Arroyo Grande, and is suspected to have murdered a man on the same day in Merced County, however, he was never prosecuted for the killing and authorities never released details of the circumstances of the murder.[7]\nOne week later, Malone took a bus trip back to St. Louis where he reunited with Crenshaw. On March 18, Malone shot and killed 62-year-old cab driver William Parr in St. Louis. Parr was found with a bullet in his head in a park near Crenshaw's home. According to Crenshaw, the pair then headed to Kansas City, Missouri, where they encountered 39-year-old James T. Rankin. On March 19, Rankin was kidnapped in the parking lot of a Denny's restaurant in downtown Kansas City. Malone and Crenshaw stole Rankin's car and took him in the trunk to a remote spot in the Mojave Desert just in or near California. According to Crenshaw, Malone took Rankin out of the trunk in the early hours of March 20 and shot him to death.[5]\nHours later, the pair arrived at a gas station in Baker, California. The cashier, 55-year-old Myrtle Dee Benham, was kidnapped, robbed, sexually assaulted, and battered to death with a pipe by Malone. Her body was found eight days later in an abandoned shack just outside Daggett. At dawn on March 21, just north of Blythe, Malone shot 51-year-old Minnie Ola White to death after robbing her.[5]\nOn March 24, Malone and Crenshaw were arrested in a stolen car in San Jose, California.[8] The pair were carrying guns as well as credit cards belonging to White and Rankin. They were taken into custody and placed in separate jails in Southern California.[5]\nOn June 14, 1983, Malone was sentenced to death in California for the murder of Benham.[9] He also received a life sentence for White's murder.[10] His death sentence was upheld in 1988.[11] On April 26, 1984, he was sentenced to death in Missouri for the murder of Parr.[12] He was prosecuted by St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch.[13][14] Malone chose to be imprisoned in California over Missouri, with a circuit judge agreeing to his request.

        "paragraph": "Matthew \"Mack\" Harrison Marsden (1849\u20131883) was a livestock trader who lived in rural Jefferson County, Missouri. Marsden was suspected of many crimes from 1881 to 1883, including arson, murder and robbery. Though he was often accused, questioned, and arrested, he was only brought to trial once, and was acquitted. Marsden's family background gave no hint of criminal activity. On the contrary, he came from an established family of farmers, engineers, and stockmen, and his wife's family members were known as leaders in the local church. His story came to an end when he was murdered, and though four different men were arrested, and three of them tried for the killing, no one was ever convicted. Mack's suspected killers left the county, the murder remained unsolved, and Marsden's death corresponded with the end of a years-long crime spree. Newspapers suggested that his killing was a service to the community, and for decades, people continued to believe he was behind a gang that committed a long series of unsolved crimes.\nMatthew Marsden's mother enjoyed nicknames for their nine children, and Matthew was called Mack. He was born in a log house where Sandy Creek is joined by Metts Branch, in Jefferson County, Missouri, which borders St. Louis County on the south. The cabin was built by Mack's father, Samuel Marsden, who married Mary Meade Johnston. Samuel built a second, larger home about a mile north, at the head of Metts Branch, and the family moved there. During that time he earned recognition for surveying and graveling the main route to St. Louis, the Lemay Ferry Road. He also was commissioner of the long, red, barn-like covered bridge spanning Sandy Creek, which today is the centerpiece of a state historic site and park. Mack was 17 years old when his mother died. Little is known of his life through his twenties, but about 1878 he joined the throngs of men who set out for the Black Hills of Dakota in search of gold. He had some success, but when there was a dispute over the claim he shared with some other men, resulting in one of them being shot dead, the peace-loving Mack returned to Missouri.\nAbout a year after his return to Jefferson County, Mack married a childhood sweetheart, Emma Jean Hensley, daughter of Leander Hensley and Cynthia Ann Williams Hensley. Her family was known for its evangelists and preachers and founded the stalwart Sandy Baptist Church, which has persisted well into the 21st Century. Mack and Emma Jean's only child, Samuel Matthew Marsden, was born in 1879.\nMack came from a family of lead and tin miners in England, who immigrated to America and were successful in mining at Galena, Illinois, a town named for the ore that produces lead. His grandparents came to Missouri about 1840 after the discovery of lead deposits there. Mack's father Samuel devoted himself to mining and engineering in Jefferson County, but Mack chose to become a livestock trader, dealing in hogs, cattle, and horses, buying them from local farmers and driving them to markets along the Mississippi River on the outskirts of St. Louis.\nMack was first associated with crime in the fall of 1881, when a reclusive farmer, Anson Vail, was found dead in his cabin after it was destroyed by fire. Although there was no evidence of foul play, the sheriff was certain Vail had been murdered. Mack admitted to visiting Vail on business on the evening of his death. He was arrested for the killing in 1882, stood trial, and was acquitted for lack of evidence.\nAlso beginning in 1881, Jefferson County farmers suffered from a series of livestock thefts, particularly hogs. The sheriff questioned Mack about those thefts, as well as about the murder of prominent merchant Joseph Yerger in the town of Antonia. The local newspaper, The Democrat, repeatedly accused Mack of various crimes, stated he was the leader of a gang of thieves, and labeled him a \"desperado\". A local vigilante committee even tried to lynch him. Yet in all that time there was no evidence and no witness to tie Marsden to any crime.\nIn the spring of 1883, Mack was arrested after selling some stolen hogs to a butcher in Carondolet. Although he had a bill of sale to prove he'd bought the hogs, he and several other men were indicted for livestock theft. With their trial approaching, all of the men were out of jail on bond. One of them had turned state's evidence, intending to name Mack as the leader of a gang of thieves. Mack planned to testify similarly against the man who accused him.\nOn August 29, 1883, Mack was returning from a trip selling livestock in St. Louis with his brother-in-law and constant companion, Allen Hensley. They were riding along the Lemay Ferry Road in Mack's wagon. At a remote location on the route, a group of men stepped into the road and one of them fired a shotgun, killing Marsden with a blast to the head and torso. Hensley was hit with a second blast, but the horse ran away with the wagon, carrying him to safety in the next town, Antonia.\nHensley survived for two days. As he lay dying, he named the men who killed him and Mack. They were finally brought to trial in 1886, but were acquitted. Fearing reprisals, the accused men all moved out of the state. The murders of Mack Marsden and Allen Hensley remained unsolved.\n",

        "paragraph": "On February 26, 2015, a gunman shot and killed seven people in several locations across the town of Tyrone, Missouri, an unincorporated community approximately 95 miles east of Springfield. The gunman, identified as 36-year-old Joseph Jesse Aldridge, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound the next day. It was the worst mass murder in the history of Texas County, which previously had experienced an average of one homicide per year.\nPolice were alerted to the shootings at 10:15 p.m. CT Thursday, when a 15-year-old girl ran to a neighbor's home to say she heard gunshots in her home and fled. Deputies responded and found her parents, Garold and Julie Aldridge, dead inside the home. A 1/4 mile away, officers found Garold's brother Harold and his wife Janell shot to death inside their bedroom. As a result, police began checking all of the houses in Tyrone, urging citizens to stay inside their residences and lock their doors.\nLess than three miles away, Darrell and Martha Shriver were both shot in their home. While Darrell died from his wounds, Martha survived and managed to identify the suspect as Joseph Jesse Aldridge as she was being taken to a hospital in Springfield. She also had a relative check on the well-being of her son Carey and his family. The relative found Carey and his wife Valirea dead on the floor of their bedroom, and their son sleeping unharmed in another bedroom.[3][4][5][6] The entire shooting spree occurred within a three-mile radius of Tyrone.[7] All of the crime scenes showed no signs of forced entry into the homes.[8]\nAn elderly woman connected to the shootings died from natural causes.[9] Authorities believe the gunman started the shooting spree after finding his mother, the aforementioned elderly woman, dead on a couch from an illness for which she had been under a doctor's care,[10] though this was unconfirmed.[11] The disease was clarified in an autopsy to be metastatic lung cancer,[12] although according to the woman's brother, it was breast cancer.[13] A relative feared the woman did not die from the disease, and had instead been smothered to death by Aldridge.[14] The woman was identified as 74-year-old Alice L. Aldridge.[15]\nAt around 5:30 a.m. on February 27, the gunman was found dead inside a pickup truck situated in the middle of a two-lane highway.[16][17] He was southeast of Summersville in neighboring Shannon County, located about fifteen or twenty miles away from the scenes of the shootings. He died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound earlier that day.[18][7][19][14] A Rock Island Armory 1911 .45-caliber handgun, believed to be the same one used in the shootings, was recovered from the truck along with a stash of ammunition.[11][3] The shootings were the worst mass murder in the history of Texas County, Missouri, which had an average of one homicide per year.[18]\nJoseph Jesse Aldridge (c.\u20091979 \u2013 February 27, 2015) was identified as the gunman in the shootings.[2] He was a cousin of the named male victims.[5] On June 15, 2007, Aldridge was arrested in Howell County for felony marijuana possession, during which he was found to have a Ruger 22/45 .22-caliber pistol in his possession. On May 2, 2008, he was sentenced to 21 months in a federal prison for owning the pistol. He was released three years later, though a judge added six months of his arrest to his sentence in 2011 at the request of Aldridge's probation officer. He was also ordered to undergo mental health and substance abuse counseling. Aldridge was known to local law enforcement, although his criminal history was described as minor. His record at the time of the shooting barred him from owning guns.[3][20][12][21]\nAldridge was described as a recluse by relatives. Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that he was involved in a feud with a cousin, who was one of the victims in the shootings, and that Aldridge and several other members of his extended family were having tense relations between one another following a fistfight involving Aldridge's brother.[14] According to a relative of the Shriver family and other residents of Tyrone, Aldridge had asked Darrell Shriver, one of the slain victims and a neighbor of his, for a job at a cabinet store he owned prior to the shootings, but was turned down. He had also reportedly threatened to kill other residents.[6][17]\nAll of the victims in the shooting were adults.[19] In the hours after the shootings, four of the seven casualties were identified by police, while the others were identified by relatives and friends before being confirmed by police. They are:[3][22][23]\nMissouri Governor Jay Nixon made a statement on the shootings, saying, \"This is a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the victims of these senseless acts and their families.\" He added that crisis counseling will be made available to Tyrone citizens.[24] Houston Mayor Don Tottingham also said, \"This is a terrible tragedy in a community that's real close-knit. This is a great town, and this is why it's such a tragedy because it shows you're vulnerable to things.\"[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe I-70 killer is an unidentified American serial killer who is known to have killed six store clerks in the Midwest in the spring of 1992. His nickname derives from the fact that several of the stores in which his victims worked were located a few miles off of Interstate 70 (I-70).\nHis victims were usually young, petite, brunette women. One of the victims was a man, but it is believed that the killer may have expected a woman in the store due to the store having a woman's name. All of the stores attacked were specialty stores and were usually only robbed of small amounts of cash.[1] He is also suspected of shooting three more store clerks in Texas during 1993 and 1994, one of whom survived, as well as a 2001 murder of a store clerk in Terre Haute, Indiana.\nDespite the case being featured on Unsolved Mysteries, America's Most Wanted, and Dark Minds, the killer is yet to be identified and investigators have not publicly identified any suspects.\nThe killing spree began on April 8, 1992, with the murder of 26-year-old Payless ShoeSource manager Robin Fuldauer in Indianapolis. She was alone in the store when she was shot, having been murdered sometime around 1:30\u00a0p.m.[1] Her body was discovered in a storage room in the back of the store around 3:00\u00a0p.m. Less than $100 had been stolen from the cash register.[2]\nThe next two murders occurred on April 11 at the La Bride d'Elegance bridal shop in Wichita.[3] The victims were Patricia Smith, 23, and the store's owner, 32-year-old Patricia Magers. As this was the only case involving multiple victims, investigators believe the killer was under the impression that there was only one woman in the store.[1] The women had stayed past the normal closing time of 6 p.m. to allow a male customer to pick up a cummerbund. Sometime after 6 p.m., the women allowed the killer into the store, thinking he was the customer they were waiting for. After the women were murdered, the actual customer arrived to pick up the cummerbund and came face-to-face with the I-70 killer. The customer noticed that the killer had a gun and the killer asked the customer to come with him to the back of the store with him. The customer refused after which the killer told him to leave the scene. Had the customer co-operated with the killer, he almost certainly would have been murdered as well.[3][4] The customer was so frightened that he did not report the incident until more than an hour had passed. He later provided details for a composite sketch of the killer, describing the killer as a slender white man with reddish hair armed with an Uzi-style gun.[4]\nOn April 27, Michael McCown, 40, was killed in his mother Sylvia's ceramics store in Terre Haute, Indiana around 4:00\u00a0p.m. McCown's wallet and less than $50 were stolen from the store. No witnesses reported seeing the killer beforehand.[5] McCown was the only man killed during the spree and it is believed by investigators that the I-70 killer chose the store because the store's solo woman's name (Sylvia's Ceramics) seemed to make it a good target. Because McCown was reported to wear his hair in a ponytail and was shot from behind, while he was kneeling to stock shelves, he may have been mistaken for a woman.[1]\nOn May 3, 24-year-old Nancy Kitzmiller was killed while working alone at Boot Village, a footwear shop in St. Charles, Missouri. She opened up the shop at noon and was found dead by customers at 2:30\u00a0p.m.[6]\nThe final confirmed murder occurred on May 7 in Raytown, Missouri. The victim was 37-year-old Sarah Blessing who was working in her gift shop, Store of Many Colors. The murder occurred during the day, and the owner of the video store next to Blessing's shop saw the killer enter the shop, heard a pop, and then saw him leave. He discovered Blessing's body after checking to see what had occurred in the store. A clerk at a nearby grocery store also saw the suspect. He was climbing a hill towards I-70.[7]\n",

        "paragraph": "Joseph \"Jody\" Hamilton (December 7, 1885 \u2013 December 21, 1906)[1] was an American mass murderer who was executed in Missouri. On October 12, 1906, he murdered five members of the same family, including three young children, during an argument over a horse saddle. After his arrest, Hamilton pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death. Dismissing any offers for leniency, Hamilton was executed in December of that year.\nHamilton was the youngest of four children. His father, James Buchanan Hamilton, was a very religious Christian preacher who always carried a Bible. He was strict with his children, refusing to let them drink or square dance. The children were only allowed to sing hymns. James Hamilton was also known to have a bad temper.[2]\nHamilton was known to have feared and respected his father. His mother died when he was 5 years old. Two years later, he was kicked in the head by a mule, giving him a permanent scar over his left eye. Several years later, Hamilton was taking care of mules when one kicked him in the chest, knocking him unconscious. When he was 12, a tree fell on him and almost broke his neck.[2]\nHamilton was known as an ordinary person, albeit with occasional bursts of temper. He once beat a man so badly in a fight that it took the man three days to recover. It is suspected that Hamilton's anger was due to his head injuries.[2]\nIn 1902, James Hamilton remarried and the family set off for Plains, Kansas. Hamilton eventually returned to Missouri by himself, where he started working for Carnell \"Carney\" Parsons, a sharecropper.[2]\nWhen Hamilton was 20, he fell in love with a 16-year-old girl named Mae Thompson, who he'd met shortly before he left for Kansas. The two eventually got engaged. Hamilton planned to use the money he earned from Carney to settle down and have a family.[2]\nThe Parson family and Hamilton initially got along. He had a particularly good relationship with Carney's three young sons. However, their relationship worsened when Hamilton found a horse and its saddle, and never tried to find the owner. According to Hamilton, Carney started to tell lies about him to Mae Thompson.[2]\nOn October 12, 1906, Carney asked Hamilton if he was willing to trade the saddle he stole for $25 and a single-barreled shotgun. Hamilton refused. Carney pressured Hamilton, saying he knew it was stolen and would report the theft to the local sheriff. Hamilton offered the saddle for the shotgun and $35, but Parsons bargained him down to the initial offer with threats. The deal was reluctantly agreed upon by Hamilton, and the Parson family departed.[2]\nAs he thought about the trade, Hamilton became increasingly angry, believing he had been cheated. He eventually took the shotgun and pursued the Parsons. When Hamilton caught up with them, he and Carney got into an argument. Afterward, Carney continued down the road. Hamilton continued to pursue them. By the time Hamilton reached Carney once more, he had lost his temper. The two men got into a fight in front of Carney's family. Realizing that Hamilton wasn't going to stop, Carney pulled out a knife. Hamilton then used his shotgun on him, hitting Carney in the leg. The shotgun broke after he fired it. The shotgun broke into three pieces afterward, and Hamilton fatally struck Carney in the head with the barrel. When Minnie tried to stop him, he struck her as well. She was badly injured but did not die.[2]\n",

The perpetrator, Lisa Marie Montgomery,[3] then aged 36-years-old, strangled Stinnett to death and cut her fetus (eight months into gestation) from her womb. Montgomery was arrested in Kansas the next day and charged with kidnapping resulting in death \u2013 a federal crime. Stinnett's baby was safely recovered by authorities and returned to the father.[4]\nMontgomery was tried and found guilty in 2007. She was executed by lethal injection shortly after midnight on January 13, 2021, having exhausted the appeals process. Montgomery became the first female federal inmate since 1953 to be executed by the United States federal government, and the fourth overall.[5][6][7]\nBobbie Jo Stinnett was born on December 4, 1981 and graduated from Nodaway-Holt High School in Graham, Missouri, in 2000.[8] Stinnett and her husband ran a dog-breeding business from their residence in Skidmore.[9]\nStinnett and Montgomery had met through dog show events and had ongoing interactions in an online Rat Terrier chatroom called Ratter Chatter.[10][11] Montgomery told Stinnett that she was pregnant too, leading to the two women chatting online and exchanging e-mails about their pregnancies.[12]:\u200a155\u200a\nOn December 16, 2004, Montgomery entered Stinnett's house and murdered her by strangulation. Montgomery then cut Stinnett's unborn child from her womb and fled the scene.[5] There was no sign of forced entry; authorities believe that Montgomery, posing as customer \"Darlene Fischer\", had arranged to visit Stinnett's house on that day.[9] It is known that Stinnett was expecting the arrival in Skidmore of prospective buyers for a terrier at about the time of her murder.[12]\nStinnett was discovered by her mother Becky Harper, lying in a pool of blood, approximately an hour after the murder.[13] Harper immediately called authorities and described the wounds inflicted upon her daughter as appearing as if her \"stomach had exploded.\"[14] Paramedics were unsuccessful in attempts to revive Stinnett, and she was pronounced dead at St. Francis Hospital in Maryville.[15] Montgomery allegedly called her husband, Kevin, that same day around 5:15\u00a0p.m. saying that, on a shopping trip to Topeka, she had gone into labor and given birth.\nThe following day, December 17, police arrested Montgomery at her farmhouse in Melvern, Kansas. A witness would later report that on the morning before her arrest, Montgomery took the infant, her husband, and two teenage sons to a restaurant for breakfast. Police had initially gone to Montgomery's home after tracing online communications to her IP address, hoping to interview her as a witness.[16] When they arrived, they found a car matching the description of the one at the crime scene, and when they entered the home, they found Montgomery inside, holding the infant, and watching television. Montgomery was arrested an hour later after her story fell apart and she confessed.[16] The kidnapped newborn, whom she claimed as her own, was recovered and soon placed in custody of the father.[17][18] The quick recovery and capture was attributed to the use of forensic computer investigations which tracked Montgomery and Stinnett's online communication.\nThe investigation was aided by the issuance of an AMBER alert to enlist the public's help. The alert was initially denied as it had not been used before in an unborn child's case and thus there was no description of the victim. Eventually after intervention by Congressman Sam Graves, the alert was implemented.[16] DNA testing was used to confirm the infant's identity.[19]\n",

He grew up in West Babylon, New York and was a standout high school athlete before  attending and graduating from the University of Maine, where he played for the Maine Black Bears football team. Belcher was named an All-American twice in college after switching in his junior year from linebacker to defensive end.\nBelcher was considered a strong small-school NFL prospect, but was not selected in the 2009 NFL Draft. He was later signed as a free agent by the Chiefs and became a regular starter at inside linebacker in 2010. His most productive season was in 2011, when he had 61 tackles and 26 assists. He was re-signed by Kansas City before the 2012 season and played in the team's first 11 games.\nBelcher died on December 1, 2012, in a murder-suicide, killing his girlfriend, 22-year-old Kasandra Perkins, before driving to the Chiefs' training facility and shooting himself in the head with a handgun.\nThe son of John Belcher and Cheryl Shepard, Belcher grew up on Long Island, New York, and attended West Babylon High School in West Babylon, New York.[1] He wrestled and played football there under head coach Albert Ritacco between 2001 and 2004.[2] He was a three-time All-American as a wrestler, and played as a linebacker, offensive tackle, nose guard, and fullback on the football team.[1] He was captain of the football team for two seasons and led West Babylon to two Long Island Football Championships playoff appearances, although the team did not reach the title game.[1] The team had its first-ever undefeated regular season in 2004, when Belcher was a senior, but lost in the Suffolk County Championship game.[1][3] The school retired his number 52 jersey, and he returned to the school frequently later in his career to give pregame speeches to the team.[4] Though he had an accomplished high school career, was a second-team All-Long Island selection in 2004, and was named to Newsday's list of the best players of the decade for the 2000s, Belcher was not heavily recruited by major college football programs.[5]\nBelcher attended the University of Maine, a Division I FCS school, and played on its Black Bears football team.[1][6] Playing as an outside linebacker, he was fourth on the team in tackles in his first two seasons, registering 58 as a freshman in 2005 and 52 as a sophomore in 2006.[1]\nBelcher had a standout season as a junior after he was switched from linebacker to defensive end.[1] The Associated Press named him a second-team All-American, while Sports Network named him a third-team All-American.[1] He led Maine's collegiate conference, the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA), with 10 sacks and 17 tackles for a loss.[1] His sacks total was seventh-highest in the nation.[1]\nBelcher was named a second-team preseason All-American by Lindy's Publications before his senior season in 2008, when he also served as a team co-captain.[1] He led the CAA again with 17.5 tackles for losses. He also had 7.5 sacks and was the association's defensive player of the year.[1][7] After the season, Belcher was named by the American Football Coaches Association and the Walter Camp Foundation as a first-team All-American in the Football Championship Subdivision, a grouping of smaller schools in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division I.[8] He was the fourth multiple-time All-American in Black Bears history, following John Huard, Aaron Dashiell and Stephen Cooper.[8]\nBelcher, who was a strong student in high school and college, graduated from Maine with a degree in child development and family relations.[5] \"He always did his work, sat right up front,\" Ritacco, Belcher's high school coach and 10th-grade biology teacher, said later.[5] After graduating from college, he won an Academic Momentum Award from the National Consortium for Academics and Sports' Scholar-Baller Program.[7]\n",

Originally signed to Jive Records, Franks was best known for his 2006 debut single, \"Pop, Lock & Drop It\".\nLawrence Franks Jr. was born on September 12, 1987, in Kinloch, Missouri, where he was raised. He moved to the Walnut Park neighborhood of St. Louis when he was five and returned to St. Louis County as a teenager. In an interview, he remembered his community as having \"a lot of drugs going on and, of course, a little bit of violence\" and said that his experiences growing up in a tough area inspired his rap lyrics.[4] Franks, the youngest of four children, recalled his childhood being \"really rough\" and stated \"My mama and daddy were on drugs. My brother was in and out of jail. The foster people were chasing me. It was crazy\".[5]\nAt age 15, Huey began creating hip hop beats.[6] His older brother referred Franks to producer Angela Richardson, who was creating a rap group. Franks began performing as Huey, and his songs \"Oh\" and \"Pop, Lock & Drop It\" became local favorites among DJs and promoters. Huey was featured on a series of mixtapes, one of which, Unsigned Hype, sold out of its run of 8,000 copies and was noticed by producer TJ Chapman, who introduced the rapper to Vice President of A&R at Jive Records, Mickey \"MeMpHiTz\" Wright, in 2006.[7]\nHuey's debut album for the label, Notebook Paper, was released in mid-2007, described by AllMusic as sounding like a mixture of Nelly, Chingy, and Ludacris.[7][8] The album reached number 26 on the Billboard 200 chart and number 10 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.[9] \"Pop, Lock & Drop It\", its lead single, peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming his biggest hit to date. Nelly's refusal to work with Huey on his debut album prompted two diss tracks \"Down, Down, Baby\" featuring Tha Camp Boyz and \"Back at Cha'\".[10] Notebook Paper's next single was \"When I Hustle\" featuring singer Lloyd. In 2007, Huey was featured on the song \"Hook it Up\" on R Kelly's album Double Up.\nHuey's second album, Redemption, was released on September 14, 2010, after many delays. The first official single from the album was \"Smile and Wave\", which features Dorrough and was released on June 15, 2010. In \"Smile and Wave\", Huey criticizes his critics.[4]\nIn 2013 Huey announced that he had officially signed with Waka Flocka Flame's label Brick Squad Monopoly and was working on his third album.[11] On May 14, 2014, Huey released his mixtape entitled Project H.[12][13] However, not much materialized from his signing to Brick Squad and Huey had been relatively quiet on the music scene in recent years.[5] According to music executive William \"Quayshaun\" Carter, who worked with Huey in the 2010s, prior to his death, Huey had just started a business in upscale clothing, \"and it was working out, and he was happy\".[14]\nOn June 25, 2020, Franks and an unidentified 21-year old male companion were shot in front of Franks' home in Kinloch, Missouri. Both men were hospitalized, but next day Franks died from his wounds at age 32.[15]\n",

They were convicted of killing five drifters at their farm in Mooresville, Missouri. When her sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1999, Faye Copeland was the oldest woman on death row.\nRay Copeland was born in Oklahoma in 1914. While he was growing up, his family moved around, struggling to survive during the Great Depression.[2][3][4] As a young man, he began a life of petty crime, stealing livestock and forging checks, until he was caught and served a year in jail. After his release in 1940, he met Faye Wilson, and they were married soon afterward. They quickly had several children and, thanks to Ray's criminal reputation, had to keep moving their family around while money was tight.[2][3][4] During this time, Ray served several jail sentences, until he finally came up with a plan to improve his illegal money-making methods so as to be undetected.\nBecause Ray was well known as a fraud, he could not buy and sell cattle on his own. To get around this problem, he began to pick up drifters and hobos and employed them as farmhands on his property in Mooresville, Missouri. He would take his employees to the market, where they would use his bad checks to buy the cattle for him. After the transactions, Ray would sell the cattle quickly and the farmhands would disappear without a trace. For a while, the scam worked, but the police caught up and Ray was once again sent to jail.[2][3][4]\nUpon his release, he resumed his criminal activities, but this time he made sure his farmhands were not as connected to him as before. This went on until a previous employee, Jack McCormick, called the Crime Stoppers hotline in August 1989 to tell them about the Copelands.[2][3][4] McCormick claimed that he had seen human bones on their farm while he was employed there and also claimed that Ray had tried to kill him.\nPolice were initially skeptical of the claims, but after checking Ray's criminal record, they decided to investigate further. In October 1989, they visited the Copeland farm armed with a search warrant, dozens of officers and a team of bloodhounds.[2][3][4] Initially, they did not find any incriminating evidence, but after further searching, the bodies of three young men were discovered in a nearby barn. As the search continued, more bodies were found, all killed with the same weapon: a .22 caliber Marlin rifle that was later found in the Copeland home.[2][3][4]\nIt became clear that Ray killed his employees in the pursuit of money, but Faye's actions were initially questioned. [2][3][4] When she went to trial in November 1990, her defense mounted a picture of her as a dutiful wife and mother who had endured beatings and general ill-treatment from her husband. However, the jury convicted her of five counts of first degree murder. She was given four death sentences for the murders and one life sentence. \nIn March 1991, Ray went on trial, was convicted of five counts of murder and sentenced to death. Upon hearing that Faye had been sentenced to death by lethal injection as well, Ray showed no emotion and replied \"Well, those things happen to some, you know.\"[2][3][4]\nRay died of natural causes on October 19, 1993. His body was cremated. Faye's attorneys appealed her conviction, contending that the jury had not been allowed to hear evidence that Ray had abused her for years. On August 6, 1999, Judge Ortrie Smith overturned the death sentence, but let the convictions stand and commuted her sentence to five consecutive terms of life without parole. \nOn August 10, 2002, Faye suffered a stroke that left her partially paralyzed and unable to speak. Weeks later, in September 2002, Governor Bob Holden authorized a medical parole for Faye, fulfilling her one wish that she not die in prison. She was paroled to a nursing home in her hometown of Chillicothe, Missouri, where she died of natural causes at the age of 82. She left behind five children and 17 grandchildren.\n",

He and his wife were both convicted for first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Zein Isa died of diabetes before he could be executed. Maria Isa was later resentenced to life imprisonment and died in prison.\nPalestina Zein Isa, named after Palestine, was born on December 6, 1972 in Mato Grosso, Brazil.[2] The youngest of seven siblings, she lived in a southern portion of the City of St. Louis in an apartment complex,[3] and attended Dewey Junior High School[4] and Roosevelt High School in Saint Louis. Her father was a Muslim Palestinian, Zein Isa, who originated from Beitin, West Bank.[1] Her mother, Maria Isa, was Brazilian and a Roman Catholic.[1] As a result Tina was of German, Italian, Palestinian, and some indigenous South American descent.[5] She learned Arabic and Portuguese from her parents and Spanish during her time living in Puerto Rico.[6]\nZein al-Abdeen Hassan Isa,[7] born on June 3, 1931, was the third son of a farmer.[8] While a teenager, he married a woman named Foiziya, his double first cousin.[9] In the 1950s, Zein left Palestine,[10] emigrating with members of neighboring families.[8] He first lived in the south of Brazil and, while on a business trip to Rondon\u00f3polis, Mato Grosso, met Maria Matias (born August 10, 1943), a native of Mato Grosso who had been born in Santa Catarina. She was of German, Italian, and South American native descent.[11]\nOn February 6, 1963, the two married despite the opposition of Maria's parents.[12] Zein did not reveal to Maria that she was his second wife until after they had married.[13] They moved to Raleigh, North Carolina in fall 1963, then to Paterson, New Jersey, Arecibo, Puerto Rico, back to Rondon\u00f3polis, then to C\u00e1ceres, Mato Grosso;[14] Tina was born in Mato Grosso.[2]\nThe family moved back to Puerto Rico, living in Arecibo until moving to Isabela one year later. During this time, the father, without the mother, lived with his children in the West Bank for periods of time.[15]\nIn 1980, Zein became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[16] The entire family moved to Beitin in the West Bank when Tina was five.[17] The family came to St. Louis around 1986[16] and owned a grocery store there.[18] Tina began learning English after arriving in St. Louis,[4] where her friends gave her the nickname \"Tina\".[19] In 1991, Tim Bryant of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch wrote in regards to the parents, \"Neither speaks English well.\"[16]\nTina's relationship with her father deteriorated after she turned fourteen; in earlier years they had enjoyed a closer relationship.[20] She listened to American popular music such as hip hop,[1] dance, rap, R&B, and rock.[citation needed] Tina Isa's ambition was to become a pilot after taking aeronautical engineering courses;[3] she intended to do this at Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology (part of St. Louis University).[21] Zein wanted to arrange Tina as a marriage partner to a man from his hometown.[1] Isa's elder sisters stated their dislike of her lifestyle. Her family sent people to extract her from a prom dance she attended.[16] When her family learned that she, since January 1989, was engaged in a romantic relationship with a 20-year-old African-American, Cliff Walker, Tina's parents grew even angrier.\n[22] Zein Isa held grudges against African-Americans because he believed Palestinian businesspeople had been targeted by black criminals.[23]\nPrior to his daughter's murder, Zein made telephone calls stating that Tina had damaged the honor of his family and needed to die. On the day of her death, she worked her first day at a Wendy's fast food restaurant;[22] the family also opposed the idea of her not working for the family's grocery business.[18] Ellen Harris, author of Guarding the Secrets, wrote that \"The problem was that Tina thought of herself as American or hyphenated-American, not as Arab.\"[24]\nHer murder took place at the Delor Park Apartments, in her family's residence.[21] Isa's boyfriend walked her home after the first day of her job. Initially, her parents criticized her for having the outside job and later stated a belief that she was doing something else instead of working. Zein Isa stabbed his daughter with a boning knife. One of her lungs, her liver, and her heart were severely damaged by six blows to her chest. Maria Isa assisted Zein by holding Tina.[22] FBI agents were not at the surveillance unit when the killing happened.[18]\nTina Isa was buried at Sacred Heart Cemetery in Florissant, Missouri, reportedly in a bridal gown. Her Brazilian mother said unmarried girls and women in Brazil who die are buried accordingly. The family intentionally did not provide notice of the funeral to the media to ensure that only people from the family, the local Palestinian community and people from Beitin attended. They expressly did not want Tina's boyfriend to attend. FBI agents secretly monitored and photographed the proceedings.[25]\n",

The footage was taken on June 2 from 2:13\u00a0a.m. to 2:16\u00a0a.m. All suspects in the video had their faces concealed. Six wore masks, and one had a white shirt wrapped around his face and head. At least two of the men were seen armed with handguns. One person pulled his handgun to target the entrance before joining the others. Another suspect had a cut on his left palm.

He and his brother Charley, both members of the James\u2013Younger Gang under James\u2019s leadership, went on to perform paid re-enactments of the killing at publicity events. Ford would spend his later years operating multiple saloons and dance halls in the West.\nTen years after James's death, Ford was himself the victim of a fatal shot to the neck by Edward Capehart O'Kelley in Creede, Colorado, dying at only 30 years old. While initially buried in Creede, his remains were later exhumed and reinterred in his hometown of Richmond, Missouri.\nRobert Ford was born in 1862 in Ray County, Missouri, to James Thomas and Mary Bruin Ford as the youngest of seven siblings. As a young man, Ford came to admire Jesse James for his Civil War record and criminal exploits, eventually getting to meet him in 1880 at the age of 18.\nFord's brother Charley is believed to have taken part in the James\u2013Younger gang's Blue Cut train robbery[1] in Jackson County, west of Glendale, Missouri (renamed Selsa and now part of Independence), on September 7, 1881.[2][3]\nIn November 1881, after the train robbery, James moved his family to St. Joseph, Missouri, and intended to give up crime. The James gang had been greatly reduced in numbers by that time; some had fled the gang in fear of prosecution, and many of the original members were either dead or in prison after a botched bank robbery in Northfield, Minnesota. \nAfter the train robbery, James\u2019s brother Frank James had also decided to retire from crime and moved East, settling in Lynchburg, Virginia.[4]\nBy the spring of 1882, with his gang depleted by arrests, deaths and defections, James thought that he could trust only the Ford brothers.[5] Charles had been out on raids with James before, but Robert was an eager new recruit. The Fords resided in St. Joseph with the James family, where Jesse went by the alias Thomas Howard.\nHoping to keep the gang alive, James invited the Fords to take part in the robbery of the Platte City Bank in Missouri, but the brothers had already decided not to participate; rather, they intended to collect the $10,000 bounty placed on James by Governor Thomas T. Crittenden. In January 1882, Robert Ford and gang member Dick Liddil had surrendered to Sheriff James Timberlake at their sister Martha Bolton's residence in Ray County. They were brought into a meeting with Crittenden, as they had been around James's cousin Wood Hite the day Hite was murdered. Crittenden promised Ford a full pardon if he would kill James, who was by then the most wanted criminal in the US.[6][page\u00a0needed] Crittenden had made capturing the James brothers his top priority; in his inaugural address he declared that no political motives could be allowed to keep them from justice. Barred by law from offering a sufficiently large reward, he had turned to the railroad and express corporations to put up a $5,000 bounty for the delivery of each of them and an additional $5,000 for the conviction of either of them.[7]\nLiving with the James family, the Fords became part of the daily routine, and James\u2019s wife cooked for them. They were nervous and bored, looking for opportunity, and feeling restless. The confession of Liddil to participating in Hite's murder made the news, and pressure began to build around James.[citation needed]\n",

Three people were killed: the pastor of the church and two deacons. Police suspected that he was specifically targeting church leaders.\nSaimon was arrested after approximately ten minutes of negotiations with the police.

        "paragraph": "On August 19, 2015, a Moorish man named Mansur Ball-Bey was shot and killed by a St. Louis police officer who was executing a search warrant at a house where Ball-Bey was present. Rumors surrounded the killing of Ball-Bey as to whether he was unarmed when shot by police, and crowds gathered in the street to express anger at the killing. The demonstrators, in response to harassment and violence by STL Metro police officers, engaged in acts of civil unrest well into the night. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney's office conducted a subsequent investigation and determined that the evidence did not support criminal charges against the two officers involved.\nOn the morning of August 19, 2015, at least 15 police officers and ATF agents[1] arrived at Ball-Bey's aunt's home in the Fountain Park neighborhood of St. Louis to execute a search warrant. As police prepared to enter the home, Ball-Bey and one other man ran from the house.[2] Police said that Ball-Bey had pointed a handgun with extended ammunition magazine at them, prompting them to open fire.[1] After police fired their weapons, Ball-Bey was struck in the back and killed.[2] Police said that crack cocaine were recovered from the scene.[3] Police also said that they recovered two stolen firearms at the scene,[3] specifically .40-caliber handguns.[1] No usable DNA evidence was recovered from the guns, which is not unusual.[1] However, social media postings by Ball-Bey showed me holding a gun matching the guns found on the scene.[1] Ball-Bey had no criminal history, but \"photos found on his cellphone and YouTube videos show him wearing T-shirts naming a gang in St. Louis.\"[1]\nOne witness, an off-duty officer \"said he saw Ball-Bey running with a gun in his hand and his arm extended before the witness ducked behind a parked truck. The witness said he could hear the shooting but could not see it but reported seeing Ball-Bey toss a gun near a trash bin afterward.\"[1] The gun was loaded.[1]\nBall-Bey's family disputed the police claim, claiming that the gun had been planted on Ball-Bey by police.[1] The family's attorney claimed Ball-Bey was running from police when shot, explaining the bullet wound to the back.[4] In contrast, the attorney for the two officers stated that \"My client fired in defense of his partner ... when (Ball-Bey) turns toward (one officer) with a gun that has an extended clip with a 30-round magazine, the policemen have no choice but to pull the trigger.\"[2]\nIn the afternoon of the same day, angry residents took to the streets of Fountain Park to express outrage at the killing of Ball-Bey. Police responded with riot officers, and protests soon took a turn for the worse as protesters began throwing bricks, rocks and bottles at the police, who responded with tear gas.[5]\nAccording to police, over the course of the night, bricks and bottles were thrown at officers, and police responded with tear gas to disperse crowds.[3][6] The police chief reported nine arrests, the torching of one car, and several reports of attempted robbery.[3] St. Louis Alderman Antonio French reported that the disordered was partially fueled by misinformation, including false reports that Ball-Bey was 13 years old.[3]\nThe day following the shooting, about 200 people attended a vigil in St. Louis in protest of the killing; unlike the events of the previous night, the vigil was peaceful.[3]\nIn 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri (ACLU) filed a lawsuit over the police handling of protests following the shooting of Ball-Bey. The ACLU of Missouri alleges that the police deployed tear gas indiscriminately and without warning.[7][8]\nA few days after the shooting, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce announced that her office would conduct an investigation.[2][4] In June 2016, the circuit attorney office's report was made public, and Joyce announced that no charges would be filed against the two officers who shot Ball-Bey. Joyce said that more than two dozen people were interviewed during the investigation. She stated that eyewitness accounts and other evidence showed that it could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers did not act in self-defense.[1]\n",

There has been significant criticism around the police and governmental response to protests, resulting in lawsuits from the ACLU.[10][11]\nRoughly 200-300 demonstrators assembled in downtown St. Louis near the city courthouse.[12] The protests were mostly peaceful. Police used pepper spray to drive back protesters on at least two occasions: after protesters responded angrily to the approach of buses filled with police in tactical armor (riot gear), and after individuals mounted an abandoned police vehicle and damaged its windshield.[13]\nDemonstrations later moved to the Central West End neighborhood, where they swelled to over 1,000 people. They were peaceful until about 9:45\u00a0pm, after protesters made their way to the home of mayor Lyda Krewson. Despite urgings from demonstration leaders, at least one protester put a rock through the mayor's window.[12][5] The mayor is believed not to have been home. Although most demonstrators dispersed immediately, police deployed pepper spray and tear gas, driving back remaining demonstrators and onlookers through the Central West End's commercial area. There, angered protesters damaged several businesses.\nA total of 33 people,[14] 32 of whom were local,[14] were arrested and charged with crimes ranging from peace disturbance to destruction of property.[14] The US Justice Department announced that no federal investigation will take place.[15]\nOn the afternoon of September 16, protesters marched through a shopping center in the St. Louis suburb of Des Peres and blocked a road.[16] As the sun set a peaceful march made its way through the St. Louis suburb of University City. As night fell, however, demonstrators threw projectiles at police and smashed storefront windows as police drove them down Delmar Boulevard. 23 businesses and a police vehicle were damaged.[17] Police made nine arrests.[16]\nAbout 1,000 people protested outside police headquarters in downtown St. Louis. The event was peaceful until a small group of protesters started smashing the windows of a Marriott hotel and other businesses. Police arrested 123 people.[18][19][20] Police also said unknown chemical substances were thrown at them and that an officer on bike was taken to the hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.[8] Among those arrested included an undercover St. Louis police officer, a Getty Images photojournalist, and an Air Force lieutenant.[21]\nProtestors gathered outside the downtown St. Louis jail.[22]\nPolice in Richmond Heights shut down the St. Louis Galleria after a group of protesters blocked the intersection of Brentwood Boulevard and Galleria Parkway.[23]  Protests started outside Busch Stadium in downtown St Louis, as a Billy Joel concert took place.[24]\nProtesters marched through the Saint Louis Galleria in Richmond Heights before St. Louis County Police said it ordered the demonstrators to disperse.[25] Police made 22 arrests.[25] One officer and two protesters were injured during the incident. Some protesters alleged that the police did not give the dispersal order.[25]\n",

        "paragraph": "Robert Eugene Brashers (March 13, 1958 \u2013 January 13, 1999) was an American serial killer and rapist who committed at least three murders from 1990 and 1998 in the states of South Carolina and Missouri. He committed suicide to avoid arrest for an unrelated crime, and was not identified as the killer until 2018, with the help of improved DNA technology.\nVery little is known about Brashers' early life. Born on March 13, 1958, in Newport News, Virginia, he was the younger of two living children born to Doulis and Nancy Brashers.[1] When he was young, the family moved to Huntsville, Alabama, where Brashers spent his childhood and youth.[2] He reportedly had no problems with the law during his teenage years, did not use drugs or alcohol, and after graduation, he enlisted in the Army and served in the Navy for several years.\nIn the early 1980s, Brashers resigned from the Army and moved to Louisiana, settling in a house in New Orleans, but by the mid-1980s, he moved again to Fort Myers, Florida. He married in the early 1990s, had a daughter with his wife in 1992 and at some point had adopted two little girls.\nIn the fall of 1985, Brashers was arrested in Port St. Lucie on charges of assaulting a 24-year-old woman named Michelle Wilkerson.[3] According to investigators, on November 22, Brashers met her in Fort Pierce and convinced her to accompany him to a bar. After spending their evening there, he took Wilkerson to a dark alleyway near a citrus grove, where, after drinking six Budweisers together, he attempted to make sexual advances on her.[4]\nWilkerson refused and attempted to leave his vehicle, after which a fight ensued between the pair, during which Brashers shot her twice in the neck and head.[3] Despite the severity of her injuries, Wilkerson remained conscious, managed to leave the car and hid in a culvert under the road. Having lost track of her, Brashers went to the beach and threw his gun into the sea.[4] He then attempted to leave, but his truck got stuck in the sand, causing to start walking the streets in search of help. In the meantime, Wilkerson made her way to a nearby apartment building, where she received medical attention. Before she was driven to the Lawnwood Hospital, she described her assailant and his car in detail to police officers.[3]\nA few minutes later, Brashers was apprehended while wandering the beach and charged with attempted first-degree murder, aggravated battery and using a firearm during the commission of a crime. He was convicted in the following year and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment, but was granted parole on May 4, 1989.[5]\nAfter his release, Brashers moved between the states of South Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia, often changing his place of residence. On February 18, 1992, he was arrested in Cobb County, Georgia for grand theft auto, unlawful possession of a weapon and theft.[6] While searching his vehicle and apartment, policemen found a radio scanner, a police jacket, lock-picking tools and a fake Tennessee driver's license. Fearing another prison sentence, he made a plea deal with the prosecutors and pleaded guilty to the most serious of the charges, allowing for the rest to be dropped. As a result, he was sentenced to an additional five years imprisonment, which he served in full and was released in February 1997.[6] For the following two years, he moved between Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri.\nOn April 12, 1998, Brashers was arrested while attempting to break into the home of an unmarried woman in Paragould, Arkansas. Having been employed by her on a previous occasion, he had cut the wires leading to her home and was armed at the time of his arrest. In addition, a video camera and locksmithing tools were seized from him as well.[6] Brashers was taken into custody, but was later released after reaching a settlement with the victim, who stated that he had made amends with her.[6]\nOn January 13, 1999, police officers noticed that a stolen vehicle had been parked in the parking lot of the Super 8 Motel in Kennett, Missouri.[7] After speaking with motel personnel, it was established that Brashers and his family had arrived in that vehicle just days earlier. Officers then broke down the door and found him hiding under a bed with a loaded gun, but when they attempted to arrest him, he started resisting and opened fire. The officers were forced to retreat and called for backup.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nBucklew v. Precythe, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the standards for challenging methods of capital punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In a 5\u20134 decision, the Court held that when a convict sentenced to death challenges the State's method of execution due to claims of excessive pain, the convict must show that other alternative methods of execution exist and clearly demonstrate they would cause less pain than the state-determined one.[3][4][5] The Court's opinion emphasized the precedential force of its prior decisions in Baze v. Rees[1] and Glossip v. Gross.[2]\nIn March 1996, Russell Earl Bucklew (May 16, 1968 \u2013 October 1, 2019) murdered Michael Sanders, with whom his former girlfriend Stephanie Ray took shelter after the breakup of their relationship, then kidnapped and raped Ray. He was sentenced to death by the state of Missouri in May 1997, and failed to have the conviction overturned in legal challenges which had completed by 2006.[6] During this period, Missouri, as well as several other states, changed its protocol for death sentences by lethal injection to a combination of drugs. Missouri itself had to clear this change through the courts, so from 2006 through 2010, only two inmates were executed.[6]\nBucklew and other convicts with death sentences across the country attempted to legally challenge states' refusal to use other protocols besides lethal injection through the courts, arguing that this was a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. This ultimately resulted in Baze v. Rees, decided by the Supreme Court in 2008, where it was determined that lethal injection by drugs was constitutional and did not violate the Eighth Amendment.[1] Further, Baze established a test for future challenges to methods of execution under the Eighth Amendment, in that inmates must show that a \"feasible, readily implemented\" alternative procedure that would \"significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain\". With the decision in Baze, the Supreme Court invalidated the other ongoing challenges, including that of Bucklew, and ordered states who had already gained approval for lethal injection to resume executions.[7]\nHowever, Missouri was forced to put its death penalties on hold, as one of the companies providing one of the injected drugs, sodium thiopental, had been pressured by anti-death penalty advocates and its dwindling supplies to stop selling the drug for such purposes.[6] By 2012, Missouri had altered its process to a single drug, first to propofol and later to pentobarbital, and in 2014, began scheduling lethal injections, including for Bucklew.[8] Bucklew sought a new lawsuit on challenging the use of the new drug for lethal injection on the basis that due his own personal health, suffering from cavernous hemangioma, that the injection could cause vascular tumors that would not allow the drug to properly circulate, and thus could experience tremendous pain before the drug shut down his systems. Bucklew asserted both facial and as-applied challenges. While the district court denied his challenge, the Supreme Court agreed to put the execution on hold to allow his appeals to be heard. In the Eighth Circuit, the court rejected Bucklew's facial challenge, as well as turned down his as-applied challenge as given but allowed Bucklew's case to be reheard if he could demonstrate that there was a feasible alternative, as per Baze.[9] Prior to the rehearing, the Supreme Court concluded in Glossip v. Gross in 2015 that affirmed the Baze requirement that an Eighth Amendment challenge to capital punishment puts the onus on inmates to show that there exists an alternative that is \"feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduces a substantial risk of severe pain.\"[2]\nWhen Bucklew returned to court in 2015 he had amended his claim with the suggestion that lethal gas was a viable alternative to lethal injection, and later identified nitrogen as a viable alternative (e.g. via inert gas asphyxiation). This gave enough possibility of a triable remedy that allowed the case to proceed to an additional discovery phase. Bucklew had brought in an expert witness in anesthesiology who had affirmed that even after the injection Bucklew would still have brain function and could experience pain, based on a study done with horses.  Eventually both the district and Eighth Circuit rejected these claims.[10] The Supreme Court intervened a second time, in early 2018, while Justice Anthony Kennedy had still been serving, to put Bucklew's case on hold and evaluate his case.[11]\nThe Court issued its opinion on April 1, 2019. In a 5\u20134 decision falling along ideological lines, the Court upheld the Eighth Circuit's decision, affirming that Baze and Glossip provided the proper tests, and the evidence presented by Bucklew was not sufficient for either a facial or as-applied challenge to the Eighth Amendment.[3] Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion, joined by the other four conservative Justices. Gorsuch wrote that the Eighth Amendment \"forbids 'cruel and unusual' methods of capital punishment but does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death\"; while a constitutionally-valid death sentencing like hanging would require a moment of intense pain, the Eighth Amendment would forbid methods like being drawn and quartered that \"intensified the death sentence by 'superadding' terror, pain or disgrace.\"[12] Gorsuch criticized the choice of death by inert gas asphyxiation, as it was neither a method prescribed by Missouri, and while it was an authorized method in three other states, no one has been put to death by the method to date.[13] Gorsuch also wrote that Bucklew, by this point, had spent twenty years on death row, and there is reasonable expectation by states to complete death sentences in a timely manner. Gorsuch argued that inmates that were seeking alternative methods under the Baze/Glossip test in good faith should readily be able to show evidence for their case, and considered that Bucklew's continuing challenges were stalling tactics.[12][13] Both Thomas and Kavanaugh wrote concurring opinions. Thomas argued that under the Eighth Amendment, the Court only had to show that Missouri's choice of death sentence was not purposely designed to inflict additional pain on the inmate.[13]\nThe dissenting opinion was written by Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by the other three liberal justices on the bench. Breyer argued that Bucklew had sufficiently demonstrated that death by lethal injection could cause unnecessary intense pain and an \"excruciating and grotesque\" execution due to his conditions, and in his as-applied challenge, that death by nitrogen gas met the standards for Baze and Glossip. While Missouri did not use this method, it was authorized (though never previously implemented) in three other states.[12] Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a separate opinion, urging that there is no reason to rush execution sentences, particularly to avoid having any judicial mistakes harm the impact of the Constitution.[13]\nOn June 25, 2019, the Missouri Supreme Court scheduled an execution date of October 1 for Bucklew.[14]\nMissouri Governor Mike Parson denied clemency for Bucklew on the morning of his planned execution, and he was executed as scheduled on October 1, 2019. He was pronounced dead at 6:23 p.m. CDT, eight minutes after being administered a lethal dose of pentobarbital.[15][16]\nThere were no reported complications with the execution.  Corrections staff took precautions with Bucklew such as elevating the head of the gurney to prevent his choking on blood if a tumor were to burst and sedating him with Valium before the execution.[17][18]\n",

Harry, nicknamed \"Cherries\", was known as a ladies man and a daring crook. A first-class street fighter, Harry was quick on the trigger of a pistol and known for his hair-trigger temper. Locked up in the City Workhouse in the spring of 1913, Harry staged a daring escape and resumed his place in the Egan mob.\nWhile in Chicago with his brother John on November 5, 1914, the two Dunn brothers shot and killed a gangster named Robert Koch. Both men were convinced that Koch had been sent up from St. Louis to specifically kill them. While Harry got off scot free, Pudgy was convicted and sentenced to an Illinois prison.\nFrustrated that Egan gang boss Tom Egan hadn't done anything to help his imprisoned brother, Harry went to the St. Louis police headquarters in December 1915 and offered to snitch on his gangmates in order to free Pudgy from prison. The cops turned down Harry's proposal. As he left the police station, Dunn ran into William \"Skippy\" Rohan, one of the original members of the Egan's Rats. Worried that Rohan would rat him out, Cherries Dunn became increasingly paranoid.\nOn December 21, 1915, Cherries Dunn got into a beef with a group of laborers in a saloon at Goodfellow and Cote Brilliante avenues and ended up fatally shooting John Groenwald over trivial reasons. Nine days later, Dunn and two pals botched a holdup and killed a North St. Louis saloonkeeper named Charles Reutilinger. \nWith a police dragnet out for him, Harry Dunn strode into Tom Egan's saloon at Broadway and Carr streets at 12:30 on the morning of January 8, 1916. Inside he saw Skippy Rohan. Cherries ordered drinks for everyone except Rohan. Skippy asked, \"What's the matter with me?\" Dunn replied, \"Go on, you snitch!\" Before Skippy could answer, Harry shot him dead. Dunn had violated a cardinal rule of the Egan's Rats, by killing someone on the premises of Tom Egan's saloon.\nBecause Willie Egan was a good friend of Dunn's, the gangster's life was spared. Cherries Dunn signed on with the old Bottoms Gang, and continued to rob and kill with no abandon. His main hangout was the Typo Press Club, a saloon located at the rear of 712 Pine Street. \nThe final straw occurred on August 21, 1916, when Cherries Dunn and his pal, Eddie Schoenborn, shot and killed a semi-pro boxer named Harry Romani who was hooked up with the Egan mob. The task of getting rid of Dunn thus fell to his friend Willie Egan.\n",

O'Neal, who was serving a life sentence for the robbery and murder of 78-year-old Ralph Roscoe Sharick, stabbed Dade to death at the Missouri State Penitentiary. For the latter murder, O'Neal was sentenced to death and executed in 1995 at the Potosi Correctional Center via lethal injection.[2] O'Neal is notable for being the only white person to be executed for killing a black person in the history of modern Missouri.[3][4]\nOn July 6, 1979, O'Neal and his accomplice, John E. Boggs, broke into the home of Doctor J. Larry Dowell in Strafford, Missouri. While burglarizing the home, Dowell's father-in-law, 78-year-old Ralph Roscoe Sharick, who lived in a trailer home behind the house, entered the property after hearing a disturbance. After confronting O'Neal and Boggs, Sharick was bound and placed into a chair in a closet. After stealing a saxophone, a guitar, and a couple of guns, O'Neal fired four shots with a .22 caliber gun into the closet, one of which fatally struck Sharick in the chest. His body was found later that night by Dowell when he returned home.[5][6]\nBoggs was captured and arrested two days later in Fort Worth, Texas.[7] O'Neal remained a fugitive and became the subject of a multi-state manhunt. On August 25, 1979, he was captured in Enid, Oklahoma, after police received a tip from an area truck stop operator. He was found sleeping in a stolen truck and had been working in the Enid area.[8] O'Neal was held without bail in the Greene County Jail. He was charged with capital murder, first-degree burglary, stealing, and armed criminal action.[9] On August 27, O'Neal waived extradition and was returned to Springfield, Missouri.[10]\nO'Neal and Boggs both pleaded innocent to all charges.[11] Each accused the other of pulling the trigger.[5] On January 24, 1980, O'Neal was convicted of first-degree murder. On February 22, 1980, he was sentenced to life in prison by Circuit Judge James H. Keet. O'Neal was then transported to the Missouri State Penitentiary to serve his sentence.[12] For his role in the crime, Boggs also received a life sentence. He was eventually granted parole but was barred from ever returning to Greene County.[5]\nWhile serving life in prison, O'Neal became a member of the white supremacist group, the Aryan Brotherhood,[13] and was affiliated with the Aryan Nations.[14] On February 3, 1984, at noon, 33-year-old Arthur Dade, a black American man serving a twenty-two-year sentence at the Missouri State Penitentiary for two armed robbery convictions in 1979, was attacked by three white inmates.[15] O'Neal, accompanied by fellow inmates Lloyd Schlup and Rodnie Stewart, attacked Dade in a prison hallway outside the prison dining hall. Dade had been released from his cell to eat his noon meal.[16] Schlup allegedly held Dade's arms, while Stewart threw hot liquid in Dade's face to distract him.[17] O'Neal then stabbed Dade to death with a homemade ice pick.[18][19] Dade was stabbed four or five times in the chest and once in his right arm. He was pronounced dead by prison physicians twenty minutes later.[20] Both Dade and O'Neal were residents of the Special Management Unit, which was a special prison inside the Missouri State Penitentiary. The unit was used for the confinement of 400 of the most troublesome inmates.[21]\nO'Neal, Schlup, and Stewart were each charged with capital murder in the killing of Dade. Prosecutors called the killing a well-planned \"Aryan hit.\"[22] O'Neal tried claiming that he had killed Dade in self-defense.[23] Ultimately, all three suspects were found guilty. O'Neal and Schlup were sentenced to death, while Stewart was sentenced to life in prison.[17] Schlup's death sentence was overturned in 1999 following Schlup v. Delo, in which he was retried, and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder to avoid being sentenced to death.[24]\nOn December 6, 1995, O'Neal was executed at the Potosi Correctional Center via lethal injection.[25][26] He was pronounced dead at 12:17\u00a0a.m.[27][28] His final statement was, \"Praise the Lord and the name of Jesus. I forgive everybody involved in this. Jesus is my Lord.\"[29] He clutched a bible to his chest during the execution.[30][31] He declined a last meal and instead fasted all day on the day before his execution.[32]\nO'Neal's execution marked the rare occasion of a white person being executed for killing a black person.[33][34] He remains the only white person to have been executed for killing a black person in the history of modern Missouri.[3] Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in the United States in 1976, only 21 white people have been executed for murdering a black victim (less than 1.4 percent of all executions).[4][35]\n",

        "paragraph": "Thomas Andrew Williamson (April 23, 1831 \u2013 October 31, 1891) was a 19th-century American serial killer. First sentenced to death for an 1868 murder in Illinois, his sentence was commuted to 20 years imprisonment and he was released after serving 11 years. He then moved to Missouri, where he subsequently murdered his wife and two men in 1889 and 1890, respectively. He was convicted of the latter murders, sentenced to death again and executed in 1891.[1]\nWilliamson was born in Mackinaw Township, Illinois on April 23, 1831, one of five children to wealthy farmer Reuben W. Williamson.[2] According to Thomas, his father was a harsh man who demanded hard work from his son from an early age. At the age of 10, he began to steal, committing numerous thefts around Tazewell County, and spending a majority of his evenings in Oakdale, where he was known as a miscreant.[2] At age 13, he attempted to rob a store in Pekin, but was caught and sent to the local penitentiary, but released after being found not guilty at a trial several weeks later.[2] At age 22, he was struck down with an illness, which caused him to be paralysed on one side.[3]\nAfter spending a majority of the following years bouncing between working for his father and uncle, Thomas was jailed for horse stealing in Centralia, where he spent a week. Upon his release, he decided to join the Union Army, thinking that the military life might do him good. He enlisted in the 7th Illinois Infantry Regiment, spending most of his time in Bald Knob.[2] After being honorably discharged, he returned to Mackinaw Township, worked at various odd jobs and made considerable profit. Williamson would eventually enlist in the 108th Illinois Infantry Regiment, who were dispatched to Tennessee. During his time, he resumed his thefts, stealing small items from fellow soldiers like pocket watches. According to Thomas' account, he fought in the Siege of Vicksburg, Siege of Corinth, the battle at Red River, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of Lookout Mountain and numerous others. After the war ended, he returned to Illinois.[2]\nIn 1868, Williamson, together with a brother-in-law named Shivler and a friend named Harket, decided to go over to the house of an old German named August Koch, whom lived in Delavan,[4] where they would play cards together. Everyone present drank heavily, and an altercation arose between the three men and Koch, whom accused them of cheating. With the help of Shivler and Harket, Williamson proceeded to kill the old man, and they all buried his body under the house.[2] Not long after, Shivler and Harket were captured, but Thomas evaded authorities for a little while longer before also being caught in Springfield. All three men were sentenced to hang, but at the last minute, thanks to his attorney B.S. Prettyman, then-Governor Richard J. Oglesby decided to commute their sentences.[4] Williamson spent 11 years in prison, working overtime to earn money. Upon his release on April 1, 1879,[3] he returned to Mackinaw Township yet again, only to learn that his father had died.[2] After working for a man named Mr. Orndorff, he moved to Missouri, travelling around the state and nearby Kansas, where he continued to commit various petty crimes.[3]\nIn January 1877, Williamson married 57-year-old Susan Kerk in Centralia, Missouri.[3] The couple were happy together, but their poverty forced them to travel around Missouri, selling wares to whoever might be interested. The following year, they came across a Dr. Middleton, whom directed them to go to Sedalia, where the local mayor, Col. Crawford, would likely find suitable work for them.[5] By the fall of 1889, the couple were living in a log cabin six miles outside Sedalia, but they abandoned some time in September or October. Williamson moved to the city and worked various odd jobs, but strangely, his wife was nowhere to be found. When queried about her whereabouts, Thomas replied that she had gone to visit some relatives in Calhoun, Illinois, and would return shortly.[5] When she didn't, Williamson claimed that she had died from renal colic while in Illinois, and being too poor to have her remains transported, he would have her buried there. Although some were suspicious of his claims, nobody looked further into the incident and it was soon forgotten.[5] The only one to take notice was farmer Dan Clossier, the new owner of the log cabin, whom was informed by Williamson not to dig out a certain location on the premises, claiming that \"he had planted parsnip there\".[6] At some point, Williamson became a member of the local Salvation Army branch, where he was sheltered.[7] As he was jobless at the time, he sought out work around the town, and would eventually find employment as a farmhand on the Moore farm, which was run by 59-year-old Jefferson \"Jeff\" Moore and his 29-year-old son, Charles.\nIn early May 1890, Charles suddenly vanished, but not much attention was paid to his disappearance. A week passed, during which Jeff bought some rails from a neighbor, John Brennicke, promising to pay for them soon. When he failed to arrive on the agreed date, Brennicke went to the Moore farm, he was puzzled, as Jeff was nowhere to be seen. Williamson was present, and when asked about the older man's whereabouts, he replied that he hadn't seen him. This aroused suspicion in Brennicke and the other neighbors, as on the previous day, Thomas had been seen hauling dirt to the house for unknown reasons.[7] A search party was organized to find Jeff Moore. In the meantime, local police officers were alerted that an old man had attempted to commit suicide in Sicher's Park by ingesting a lethal dose of strychnine. Four officers were sent to the park, where they found Thomas Williamson lying on the ground, barely clinging onto life. He was immediately transported to the Salvation Army barracks, where he was given antidotes, and soon completely recovered. When asked about why he had attempted to die by suicide, he replied that he \"had been tired of living\" and wanted to meet God.[5]\nNot long after his suicide attempt, the search party, while excavating the Moore farm, found Jeff's body buried in the cellar. Later in the day, Charles' body was also found buried in one of his father's fields. Both men had had their skulls caved in with an axe.[7] The locals quickly connected the dots, and accused Williamson of the crime. He was promptly arrested, and lodged in the county jail to prevent him from being lynched. When rumors that he had killed his wife resurfaced, Dan Clossier and another neighbor set out to the log cabin and dug out the spot that Williamson had previously forbidden him from touching.[6] There, they found the preserved remains of Susan, curled up in the fetal position.[6] Her body was then transported to the coroner, and after confirming that she had died in a suspicious manner, her body was sent to town for further inquiries. At the inquest, the jury unanimously agreed that all three victims had died at the hands of Thomas Williamson, who, shortly after, would be put on trial for the killings.[5]\nWhile awaiting his trial, Williamson confessed that he had killed the Moores, but claimed that he had been paid $300 to do it. In response to these claims, Jeff Moore's ex-wife and son William were arrested, but later released due to lack of evidence.[6] Before his trial, Williamson began to claim that he actually was simply an accomplice who helped bury the bodies, and would plead guilty to that charge, but not murder.[8]\nAt the preliminary hearing, it was decided that the case would be postponed, as no attorney had been set for Williamson. During the hearings, it was noticed that the accused man was wearing a hat which eerily matched one worn by the late Charles Moore, and that the hat had an identical dent which corresponded to the head wound that the former had on his head.[9] Thomas was officially indicted for the murders of Jeff and Charles Moore on November 30, 1890. When interviewed by reporters, he appeared indifferent and admitted to not having read the indictment, hinting at the hope that he might be acquitted of all charges.[10] Justice Ryland ordered that no other trials be held at Pettis County while Williamson's lasted, as the case was considered high-profile.[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "James Hendricks and Kimberlin Mills (known as Jimmy and Kim respectively) are American murder victims who were discovered on June 17, 1978. The pair were believed to have been seen together at a truck stop in Missouri, which is where the murders are presumed to have taken place. Hendricks was left at the crime scene, while Mills was found in Mississippi County, Arkansas.[1][2]\nHendricks was identified in May 2017; Mills' identity was confirmed in late 2017, and publicly released in early February 2018.[3] Neither had been reported missing. Both were from Michigan.[4]\nThe bodies later identified as Hendricks and Mills were discovered on June 17, 1978 in Pemiscot County, Missouri, and Blytheville, Arkansas, respectively. Although they were found fifteen miles from each other, they were likely murdered by the same person, as the pair were reportedly seen together before the murders at a truck stop in the same town and were believed to have been dropped off by a man.[5]\nDue to flooding, their case files were damaged, including the loss of their fingerprint records, although their dental charts and DNA information remained intact.[6][7] In September 2017, both victims were identified.[5]\nHendricks's age range was between 25 and his early 30s; this placed his birth between c. 1948 and 1953.[8] He was discovered in Pemiscot County, Missouri, where it is believed the murders took place.[6][7][9] He had blue eyes, brown hair and a light complexion with freckles. Hendricks had a tattoo on his right arm, which consisted of the letters \"J\" and \"H\", later found to be his initials. He was estimated to be 5\u00a0feet 8\u00a0inches (1.73\u00a0m) tall and weighing 130 to 140 pounds (59 to 64\u00a0kg). He had a distinctive vertical scar on his forehead, the cause of which was unknown. He wore a red shirt containing a graphic of a woman enclosed inside a circle, with the words \"hot sauce\" underneath. Other clothing included size nine or ten boots and blue jeans. Some of his teeth were reported to have been missing.[8]\nUnlike Mills, who was shot once, Hendricks had suffered three bullet wounds to his neck and head.[5]\nMills was determined to be between the ages of 18 and 25, although possibly as old as 35; this placed her birth between c. 1943 and 1960.[6] Her hair was naturally brown, but was likely dyed blond, as its color was darker toward the roots. The word \"Kim\" was amateurishly tattooed on her right arm; this was speculated, before her identification, to have been her own or her child's name, as her autopsy concluded that she had borne at least one child. Some of her teeth had yet to erupt.[2][6] She was shot once in the head with a shotgun.[6] Her possessions included a mercury dime necklace and a multicolored striped shirt and jeans.[1][7]\nHendricks's identity was confirmed first, in May 2017. His DNA was matched to his sister June. Additionally, his fingerprints were linked to those taken by the Michigan Department of Corrections; Hendricks had served a prison term in Michigan for an unspecified offense. After his relatives were contacted by police with questions about his female companion, they informed the investigators of his girlfriend at the time. Mills' brother's DNA was later obtained and was matched to her remains in February 2018. The couple had not been reported missing due to the belief that they left Michigan due to Hendricks's parole agreement.[10] The pair had planned to leave for Texas and return home after seven years, according to Hendricks' sister.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "Adam \"Eddie\" Richetti (August 5, 1909-October 7, 1938) was an American criminal and Depression-era bank robber. He was associated with Aussie Elliott and later Pretty Boy Floyd in the early-1930s, both he and Floyd later being implicated in the Kansas City Massacre in 1933.[1]\nAdam Richetti was born in Strawn, Texas on August 5, 1909, and moved with his family to Lehigh, Oklahoma three years later.[1][2]  He had an older brother Joseph and a younger sister Eva.[3]  Richetti, although he began drinking heavily at 14, was apparently uninvolved in criminal activity until his arrest for robbery in Crown Point, Indiana on August 7, 1928, two days after his 19th birthday.[2][3]  He was convicted and sentenced to serve 1 to 10 years at the Pendleton state reformatory, remaining there for two years, and paroled on October 2, 1930.[1][2]\nHe participated in his first bank robbery two years later when he joined Fred Hamner and brothers L.L. and W.A. Smalley in raiding a bank in Mill Creek, Oklahoma.[2][3] During the getaway, Hamner was killed and the Smalley brothers were wounded and captured at the scene. Richetti, also wounded, was able to escape with $800. He managed to make it to Sulphur, Oklahoma before being arrested, only two hours after the robbery. On April 5, he was convicted of the robbery and sent to McAlester state prison. He spent four months in prison before being granted release under a $15,000 bond pending appeal of his conviction.[3] Richetti quickly skipped bail and disappeared for several months.[1]\nHe finally reappeared on January 12, 1933, to rob a bank in Ash Grove, Missouri of $3,000. His partners in the heist were Edgar Dunbar and Aussie Elliott with whom he hid at his brother's home in Bolivar, Missouri. Sometime prior to this, Richetti met Pretty Boy Floyd who eventually became one of his closest confidants. The two became partners and, despite Richetti's worsening alcoholism, accompanied Floyd on a crime spree during the summer of 1933.[4] They stole a car in Castle, Oklahoma on June 8 and together stole $1,638 from a bank in Mexico, Missouri six days later. That same afternoon, two police officers were killed near Columbia for which Richetti and Floyd were wrongly accused.[1]\nThree days later, on June 16, the two men kidnapped Polk County Sheriff William Killingsworth from Bolivar,[4] driving east in his brother's car (which he stole) until reaching Clinton, Missouri, where they commandeered another car and took its driver Walter Griffith hostage as well. Both Killingsworth and Griffith were released later that night at Lee's Summit near Kansas City. Unknown to either Richetti or Floyd, while they were driving across Missouri, bank robber Frank Nash was being transported by train from Arkansas to Kansas City where his partners attempted to free him from custody. A shootout resulted, referred to as the Kansas City Massacre, which left Nash and four of his guards dead. Eyewitness accounts were inconsistent and various men were identified in the aftermath including Harvey Bailey and Wilbur Underhill. Vernon Miller, a former sheriff turned outlaw, was identified as the ringleader but his accomplices remained unknown.[1]\nMeanwhile, Richetti and Floyd struck again holding up a Galena bank for $3,000 on August 29. A month later, they rented an apartment in Buffalo, New York and moved in with their gun molls, sisters Rose Ash and Beulah Bird, on September 21. \nDespite the fact that there was nothing to link Richetti and Floyd to the shooting, the FBI identified them along with Miller as the triggermen on October 10, 1934.[3][4] At the time of the announcement, the two were still living in Buffalo with their girlfriends. Floyd, by this time, had been elevated to \"public enemy #1\" for his alleged role in the Kansas City Massacre.[1]\nThe basis for Floyd's involvement was largely circumstantial. A .45-caliber cartridge shell found at the scene was later traced to one of Floyd's guns months after the shooting and questionable testimony from one of Miller's female associates, held incommunicado by the FBI and without legal representation, was enough to convict Floyd. As a well-known associate, it was assumed that Richetti had also taken part in the rescue attempt. Richetti is believed by most modern crime historians to have had no active role in the Kansas City Massacre, the most popular story being sleeping off an all-night drinking binge at the time the shooting began.[1]\nAfter hearing the news, Richetti and Floyd fled Buffalo with their girlfriends on October 20.[4] Heading for Oklahoma, their car broke down near Wellsville, Ohio after two days on the road. They sent the girls into town to get a tow truck and hid in the woods until their return. Their presence attracted the attention of local residents who called the police and arrested Richetti.[3][4]  Floyd managed to escape but was cornered by federal agents under Melvin Purvis near East Liverpool and gunned down two days later.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "Nicholas Troy Sheley (born July 31, 1979[2]) is an American spree killer. He is serving life in prison for six murders and pled guilty to killing two others in Missouri. He was arrested on July 1, 2008 in Granite City, Illinois. A $25,000 reward was offered for information leading to his arrest. Federal authorities charged him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.[3]\nSheley, of Rock Falls, Illinois, had been arrested frequently since adolescence for crimes ranging from marijuana possession to domestic battery.[4] He and his ex-wife Holly married on May 10, 2008. The couple had been dating since 2004. They later divorced in December 2013 after his arrest.[5]\nSheley's murder spree began on June 23, 2008, when he killed 93-year-old Russell Reed in his hometown, Sterling. Police say Sheley was looking for money to buy cocaine and bludgeoned Reed. Reed's body was found in the trunk of his car three days later.[1]\nOn June 28, Sheley encountered 65-year-old Ronald Randall at a car wash in Galesburg where Randall had gone to clean his truck; Sheley murdered him and stole his truck, hiding his body behind a grocery store before leaving town. That same night, Sheley drove Randall's truck to Rock Falls and murdered Kenny Ulve, 25, Brock Branson, 29, his fianc\u00e9e Kilynna Blake, 20, and her son Dayan, 2 in an apartment. All four victims had been bludgeoned with a hammer. Sheley's DNA was found in the apartment and he was seen wearing one of the victim's clothes the next day. Holly Sheley testified that she and her husband had sex the night of the murders by a canal, not in the truck and that the truck's cab was covered in blood. The bodies of Ronald Randall and the four victims in Rock Falls were not discovered until two days later, on June 30.[1]\nSheley fled to Festus, Missouri after the Rock Falls murders and on June 29 allegedly committed his last two murders. The victims were Tom and Jill Estes, both 54, of Sherwood, Arkansas. They had attended a graduation party and were allegedly attacked by Sheley outside the hotel at which they were staying. Sheley put their bodies in Randall's truck and hid the bodies behind a gas station.[6]\nThe night before his arrest, Sheley was seen outside of a St. Louis Cardinals game, where he asked to use a tailgater's cell phone. Sheley also requested that the man delete the phone numbers. However, police were able to trace the call back to a drug house in the Kirkwood area. On July 1, Sheley was arrested outside of a bar in Granite City, IL, after bar patrons recognized him from news reports and contacted the local police. He surrendered peacefully.[7]\nSheley was convicted of the first-degree murder of Randall in Knox County, Illinois on September 29, 2011. His trial for the murder of Reed began in Whiteside County, Illinois on October 22, 2012. He was found guilty on November 6 of charges of first-degree murder, home invasion, and residential burglary, and was sentenced on January 16, 2013, to life imprisonment for the murder, as well as 30 years for home invasion and 15 years for residential burglary.[8] He is an inmate at Pontiac Correctional Center, in Pontiac, Illinois.\nSheley was also found guilty of first-degree murder in a Rock Island County court on May 29, 2014, for the four murders in Rock Falls. He was sentenced on August 11, 2014.[9] His wife, Holly, testified against him in exchange for immunity. Prosecutors have said that Sheley killed the four victims in Rock Falls after finding out that Branson was having an affair with Holly Sheley.\nIn February 2015, Sheley was extradited to Jefferson County, Missouri to stand trial for the murders of the Estes' where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.[6] Illinois, unlike Missouri, does not have a death penalty.[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Staudte Family Murders case, also known as \"The Antifreeze Murders\", was a series of killings and attempted killings within the Staudte family of Springfield, Missouri, during a five-month period in 2012. Family matriarch Diane Staudte and her daughter, Rachel Staudte, committed the crimes together using antifreeze purchased off the internet, with the rationale that antifreeze sold online would not contain the added bittering agent in commercial chemicals making the ethylene glycol poison detectable. Diane's husband, Mark Staudte, was murdered first, followed five months later by her autistic 26-year-old son, Shaun Staudte.[1] 24-year-old daughter Sarah Staudte had also been poisoned with the antifreeze, being taken to hospital in critical condition. Sarah survived the poisoning and later recovered, albeit with physical and neurological damage. Diane Staudte was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 2016, while Rachel Staudte pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in May 2015 as part of a plea deal in exchange for testifying against her mother at her trial, eventually being sentenced in March 2016 to life in prison with the possibility of parole.[2]\nDiane and Mark Staudte were a married couple living in a modest home in Springfield, Missouri with four children: Shaun Staudte (age 26), Sarah Staudte (age 24), Rachel Staudte (age 22), and Briana Staudte (age 9). The Staudte children had varying special needs, with Shaun being on the autism spectrum and still living at home, and Briana, then a fourth-grade student, having learning disabilities. In addition, Sarah Staudte, a university graduate with high grades but refused to get a job, had incurred a high amount of student loan debt and was also living at home with her parents. Diane favoured Rachel over the other siblings, and would routinely make a habit of praising Rachel and uploading photos of her onto social media. The family was musically talented and enjoyed religious-themed contemporary music; Diane was a church organist and trained nurse, and also the main source of income for the family, while Mark was the lead singer and guitarist of a local blues band called Messing With Destiny. Mark only brought in minimal income, sometimes taking odd jobs related to the band for extra earnings.[3]\nDiane and Rachel, after being arrested for the murders, claimed that the targeted family members were burdens on them. Diane alleged that Mark was lazy, would throw objects when angry, and that by the point of killing him, she \"hated his guts\". She claimed that Shaun was \"worse than a pest\" as he was always in the home and had trouble socializing with people due to his autism, leading her to kill him as well, although Rachel claimed that she initially had felt that her brother's death was unfair, arguing that her mother should have placed Shaun in assisted living instead. The murders of Mark and Shaun Staudte occurred within five months of each other. Both victims were found with a suspicious ring of blood around their mouths, but the deaths were not investigated any further, owing in part to Mark's lifestyle, which included alcohol consumption on a regular basis. Both bodies were cremated. Diane went further when she considered killing Sarah as well, owing to her not wanting to pay Sarah's student debt. The 24-year-old was poisoned, then later taken to a hospital by Diane because, according to Diane, she did not want the house to smell bad if Sarah died in it (by that point, Diane had used Mark's US$20,000 life insurance policy to move the family into another house with more space). Rachel was also bothered by the prospect of Sarah dying in the house, because she had moved into the room where Shaun had died, and claimed that it was unsettling to her. Sarah was admitted in critical condition, with organ failure and neurological damage presenting.[4][5]\nAn anonymous tip, later revealed to be from the Staudte family's local church pastor, alerted police to the deaths of Mark and Shaun Staudte possibly being connected with Sarah's acute symptoms. Multiple people who knew the Staudtes had observed that Diane was not expressing any grief for the loss of Mark and Shaun; instead, Diane frequented the social media platform Facebook and appeared aloof about the deaths. Family relative Michael Staudte revealed that there had not been any formal services to commemorate Shaun, and that he had only been informed of Shaun's passing after another relative had discovered it. Robert \"Rob\" Mancuso of Messing With Destiny recalled that Diane was behaving \"like she was hosting a party! There was no sadness. I thought it was just her way of grieving.\"[6]\nWhen police investigated the case, Diane had been planning a future vacation to Florida and was still residing with Rachel in the house where Shaun had died and Sarah had fallen ill. Diane revealed that she and Rachel had poisoned their family members with antifreeze. They had sneaked the substance into energy drinks that Mark regularly consumed, as well as into Shaun's favorite soda pop, and had specifically bought it online so as to ensure that there was no noticeable taste to it when hidden. Unlike most antifreeze sold commercially for the general public, the antifreeze purchased by Diane and Rachel lacked an added bittering agent that would have left a foul taste to anything poisoned by it. A note was discovered in Rachel's purse, on which Rachel had written a bizarre poem that read, \"Only the quiet ones will be left, my mother, my little sister and me.\"[7] A hidden diary kept by Rachel revealed that Rachel herself had been involved directly with the murders, and that she had been aware of Mark's impending poisoning at least two months beforehand. Rachel and Diane also admitted that Briana Staudte was to be poisoned after Sarah's death because of the burden of her learning disabilities. Rachel Staudte pleaded guilty in May 2015 to two counts of second-degree murder and one count of first-degree assault. Her mother, Diane Staudte, pleaded guilty to two counts of murder in January 2016 and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[8] Both Rachel and Diane have since appealed to vacate their pleas, with Rachel arguing, \"when lawyers were appointed, my fear of men was not accommodated, leading to miscommunication, coercion (and) mental duress. Being in an interview room alone with a male detective was like being flayed alive.\"[9]\nIt is unclear what happened to Briana Staudte after the arrest of Diane and Rachel. Briana, then a fourth-grade student and minor child, had not yet been poisoned by her mother or sister. The girl, whose new name has not been identified by news sources due to her age, was placed in foster care.[10] Sarah Staudte survived, but suffered severe organ damage and neurological damage as a result of the antifreeze. Her symptoms, initially thought to be flu-like, were later revealed to be caused by the poisoning. Sarah maintains a Facebook profile with information about the murder case, as well as a profile banner photo of her father performing in Messing With Destiny. Sarah was given the opportunity to read the following statement in court: \"I prefer to be a survivor than a victim. I forgive my mom for what she did to me. But she not only took away my dad and brother, but she took away my lifestyle, livelihood and my independence.\"[11][12] Sarah, who had been on the Dean's List during her years in university, was said by Greene County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Patterson to require \"a guardian, and living in an assisted living facility\" due to the effects of the poison on her body and mental state.[13]\nThe public and media expressed disgust over Diane's favouritism towards Rachel, as well as her view of her disabled children as burdens. In particular focus was Rachel's attitude towards the murders; Rachel had written in her diary, prior to her father's death, \"It's sad when I realized how my father will pass on in the next two months... Shaun, my brother, will move on shortly after... it will be tough getting used to the changes but everything will work out.\" After Shaun's murder, Rachel had posted a selfie on Facebook of herself sitting cross-legged and smiling, with a post that read, \"don't think I've seen Mom [Diane] so chilled out like this in a long time.\"[14] The case was covered extensively by various national and local news agencies. Additionally, the case was discussed at length in multiple true crime YouTube videos, and featured in a segment of 20/20, where Sarah Staudte was interviewed in recovery from her poisoning.[15]\n",

When he was a boy, Tutt's family became involved in the Tutt-Everett War, during which his father and other family members were killed.\nEnlisting in 1862 in Company A, 27th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, Davis Tutt fought for the Confederate States of America in the Trans-Mississippi Theater during the American Civil War. At its end, he decided to go west, stopping first in Springfield, Missouri, where he met Wild Bill Hickok. Despite serving on opposite sides during the war, they became friends and often gambled together. Tutt even loaned Hickok money on occasion. Historians have debated the amount, but Hickok himself stated he owed Tutt $25. The fall out between Tutt and Hickok was due to Hickok's failure to repay the money he owed, worsened by Tutt taking Hickok's watch as collateral. Hickok allowed Tutt to take it, but warned him to never wear it in public. \nHickok approached the square and called out Tutt. Tutt responded and the two men faced each other fearlessly. Each fired one shot. Tutt missed, but Hickok's shot killed Tutt.\n",

        "paragraph": "Edward Bates Soper (February 7, 1855 \u2013 March 30, 1899) was an American serial killer. Initially sought for the murder of his first wife and two daughters in Archie, Missouri in 1895, Soper killed a son from his second wife near Portland, Oregon two years later. After his arrest, he confessed to five homicides committed throughout his life, starting with the murder of his father in 1880, but was hanged solely for the one of the murders in Archie.[1]\nEdward Bates Soper was born on February 7, 1855, in Kearney, Missouri, the second of eight children born to farmers John Lewis Soper and Sarah Hyatt Soper (n\u00e9e Estes). Little is known of his life prior to committing his first crime, that being stealing a horse at the age of 20 and selling it in Kansas City.[2] Sometime after committing this deed, Soper hatched a plan to kill his father John, whom he had grown to hate over the years for unclear reasons. \nOn January 30, 1880, Edward Soper started a literary society near the family home in Kearney, inviting his father to join. Once the elder Soper accepted his invitation, Edward went to hide in a feeding lot, and when he saw his father approaching, he drew his pistol and shot him four times, killing him.[2] Soper then disposed of the murder weapon in a nearby creek, returned to the society and went on to participate in the exercises, acting as if nothing had happened. When the crime was discovered, another man named Mapes was convicted on circumstantial evidence and imprisoned for the murder.\nSoper himself was arrested for horse theft and sentenced to a 2-year prison term in a local penitentiary.[2] After his release, Soper returned to Clay County, where he married 35-year-old Ardela Hunt, a divorc\u00e9e with two children: 6-year-old Maude and 3-year-old Gillis. While the marriage was generally considered a happy one, Soper and his wife would begin to quarrel after the latter decided to join a local Christian church, to which the former objected, as he was supposedly a spiritualist.[3] On April 21, 1891, while Ardela and the two children were sleeping in their respective rooms at the family farm in Archie, Soper grabbed an axe and proceeded to murder all three of them, bludgeoning them repeatedly.[2]\nAfter killing them, he sat down and wrote several letters, claiming that he had exterminated his family because he could not properly take care of them and would rather have them die than to live in misery.[1] He then locked the doors and proclaimed that he was moving out of town because he had supposedly discovered an illegal saloon, which he considered immoral.[1] Three days after his departure, neighbors broke down the family home to find his wife and children's decomposing bodies. Soon after this discovery, an arrest warrant was issued for Soper, who would remain on the run for several years. \nIn June 1891, three fishermen found the highly decomposed body of an apparent drowning victim in the Missouri River, which was initially believed to be Soper.[4] After a coroner's inquest, the man's body was erroneously identified as that of Soper, and the case was temporarily closed.[3]\nIn the meantime, the real Soper had moved to Albina, Oregon (now a district of Portland), where he lived under the assumed name of R. S. \"Sandy\" Soper and worked as a car cleaner for the Pullman Company.[5] In 1894, Soper remarried to a woman named Catherine Brownleewe, with whom he had a child, Gilis. For around three years, the trio lived a relatively happy life until one fateful day, when Soper accidentally revealed his real name to his wife. \nOn April 16, 1897, under the guise of going to a shoemaker, Soper took his 2-year-old son with him and went out, but never returned home.[5] A few days later, he sent his wife a letter claiming that the child was \"placed where it would be well cared for\", and asked her not to worry about him.[3] In actuality, Soper had gone to a bank of the Willamette River, where he then threw Gilis into the river and let him drown, before fishing out the corpse and burying it nearby.[3]\nFor the next month or so, Soper remained on the run, using the alias \"Homer Lee\" and finding himself a job as a farm hand on a farm in Ashland.[3] He remained under the radar until a police officer from Kansas City, Sam E. Lowe, happened to read about the Portland case in a newspaper.[6] Taking note that the man had the same surname as the supposedly dead Soper, Officer Lowe contacted his brother, a local prosecutor, who used his connections around various towns in Oregon to arrange for Lowe to be dispatched and hunt the fugitive down.[6] After searching for some time, Lowe tracked Soper down to the Ashland farm, where the officer promptly placed Soper under arrest and immediately sought to have Soper extradited back to Missouri.[7] On the way, Soper confessed to killing his wife and three children, but initially denied responsibility for his father's murder.[8] While Soper showed no outward remorse for his deeds, Officer Lowe would later claim that Soper would have nightmares about drowning Gilis, and would exclaim \"He can't swim; he can't swim; poor little fellow.\" upon waking up.[8] After being asked by the medical examiner to say exactly where he had disposed of Gilis' body, Soper provided directions which led to the discovery of the boy's decomposing corpse.[9]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Young Brothers massacre (sometimes referred to as the Brookline shootout) was a gun battle that occurred outside of Brookline, Missouri (now part of Republic, Missouri) in the Ozarks region on the afternoon of January 2, 1932, during the period known as the \"Public Enemy Era\". It resulted in the deaths of six law enforcement officers, making it the worst single killing of U.S. police officers in the 20th century.[1]\nThe Young brothers, Paul, Harry, and Jennings, were well known to the law enforcement officers of southwest Missouri in the 1920s as small-time thieves. Each served terms in the Missouri State Penitentiary at \"Old Jeff\" for burglary and theft, and Jennings and Paul also served terms at Leavenworth. By the late 1920s, the three had become household names with local law officers and had even earned the nickname of the 'Young Triumvirate'\" [Stephen]. The local authorities considered the brothers non-violent until June 2, 1929, when Harry Young and an accomplice murdered Mark Noe, City Marshal of Republic, Missouri, after Noe stopped Young for drunk driving. Harry Young then disappeared with his two brothers, allegedly living under a false name in Texas for two and a half years. The brothers established a grand-scale auto theft ring, later described by the FBI as one of the largest of its kind. However, the Youngs still valued family ties, and by the end of 1931, Harry and \"Jinx\" decided to visit their family farm in Missouri. On January 2, 1932, Sheriff Marcell Hendrix of Greene County, Missouri, received reliable information indicating that the two Young brothers were at their family's farm near Brookline, a small village not far from Springfield. Hendrix quickly assembled a posse of lawmen and set out for the farm. The ten police officers and one civilian who went to arrest the Young brothers were by today's standards woefully unprepared for the job; they carried no weapons other than handguns, and most had no spare ammunition on them.[2]\nUpon arriving at the farmhouse, the police officers assembled in the front yard and yelled for the brothers to come out. They received no response, but officer Ollie Crosswhite said he had heard a person walking around inside. Sheriff Hendrix ordered tear gas to be fired into the house, with no immediate result. At that point, Hendrix and his deputy sheriff, Wiley Mashburn, decided to kick down the back door of the house and enter the home. When they did so, two persons, one armed with a 12-gauge shotgun and the other with a .32-20 rifle, opened fire from inside the house. (It is not completely clear who was in the house at the time of the gun battle, but all evidence points to the presence of Harry and Jennings Young.) Both Hendrix and Mashburn fell, mortally wounded. The officers outside began shooting into the windows of the house, while those inside continued to pour deadly fire on the exposed policemen. Another three officers, Tony Oliver, Sid Meadows, and Charles Houser were quickly gunned down. The surviving policemen, out of ammunition and pinned down, were forced to abandon their dead and dying comrades and flee for their lives. Unknown to the fleeing lawmen, Officer Crosswhite was still alive and uninjured, crouching behind a storm cellar at the rear of the house. Once the suspects inside the house became aware of Crosswhite's presence, one of them pinned him down with rifle fire while the other crept up behind him and killed him with a shotgun blast to the back of the head. While a relief party was being hastily formed in Springfield, the killers took both money and weapons from the fallen policemen and fled.\nA national manhunt immediately commenced, and the Young brothers were quickly tracked to a rented room in Houston, Texas. Houston police officers entered the home on January 5 and discovered the brothers had retreated to a bathroom. They called on the men inside to surrender, and were met with gunfire. After the officers returned fire, there was a period of silence, and then several shots were heard. A voice called out \"We're dead-come on in\". The officers found Jennings Young dead and Harry Young mortally wounded from multiple gunshot wounds. The guns taken from the murdered lawmen in Brookline were found on the bodies. The coroner's office in Houston concluded that the brothers had shot each other in a suicide pact to avoid capture. Some persons later questioned this version of events, suspecting that the officers involved had in fact fired the fatal shots.\nThe Young Brothers Massacre was one of the events that persuaded law enforcement in the U.S. to take a more professional and cautious approach to armed standoff situations, particularly those involving persons suspected of previous violence towards police officers.[original research?] A monument bearing the names of the six slain officers stands today in front of the police headquarters building in Springfield and in front of the Greene County Courts building.\nTerminus Pictures in Atlanta produced a docudrama written, directed and edited by Jim Hancock, and Produced by Alex Mionie, based on the story, released in August of 2018 called \"Come On In We're Dead.\"[citation needed] Available to stream on Amazon.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Come-Were-Young-Brothers-Massacre/dp/B07FXG75XG/ref=sr_1_1?crid=Z5FH1L7MSN62&keywords=come+on+in+were+dead&qid=1670294200&sprefix=come+on+in+were+dead%2Caps%2C109&sr=8-1\nCoordinates: 37\u00b011\u203208\u2033N 93\u00b023\u203233\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff37.185434\u00b0N 93.392542\u00b0W\ufeff / 37.185434; -93.392542\n",

        "paragraph": "Vivian Davis Chase (c. 1902 \u2013 November 2, 1935) was a Midwestern gangster of the 1920s and 1930s.\nThere are few sources on Chase\u2019s origins and early life. The official record begins in 1920, when the US Census for January 1920 reported an eighteen-year-old Vivian Davis as living in Kansas City, Missouri, who worked as a waitress in a restaurant and her parents listed as Missouri natives, although she was not living with them.[1] Her marriage certificate states she married a certain George M. Chase, also of Kansas City, Missouri, on April 1, 1921, when she was nineteen-years-old.[2]\nHer identity has been incorrectly associated with that of Vivian Grace Davis of Springfield, Missouri,[3] or with that of Albert and Sarah Davis.\nChase first gained notice as George's wife on December 23, 1923, when he was arrested for an altercation during which he was shot by Ella Keller. Keller stated that George and his companions attacked her because she had reported them to the police and that she had to shoot George in self-defense. After arresting him, the police went to his home, where they found Chase wearing six diamond rings.  She was arrested for suspicion when she could not explain her possession of the multiple rings. She was released three days later when further evidence could not be found against her.[4]\nChase did not surface in public records again until three years later when she was in the company of Charlie Mayes, also known as Pighead Hardman. On February 15, 1926, Chase, Mayes, and Lee Flournoy and his wife were arrested after a free-for-all fight in a rooming house in Wichita, Kansas. During the arrest, Chase refused to talk.[5] The investigation led investigators to her brother-in-law Charles Chase and allegations of involvement with the Joe Bratton liquor gang.[6] On June 9, 1926, following a \"drunken party and joy ride\", Flournoy and Mayes were fatally shot in a gun battle in Picher, Oklahoma during which Chase was present. The three of them had been under surveillance by Ottawa County, Oklahoma officers for several days because the deputy sheriff had informed the Sheriff of Montgomery County, Kansas that he had found the suspects who robbed the Cherryvale Bank on May 29, 1926.  Chase was placed in jail, where she refused to face reporters.[7]  She was released on June 13, 1926, after insufficient evidence was found to charge her with a crime.[8]\nChase resurfaced in June 1932, when she was arrested with Jackie Forman and Enos Weeks for the robbery of the First National Bank in North Kansas City on April 9, 1932. She was held on a $50,000 bond. Chase was held at the Clay County Jail in Liberty, Missouri and escaped after four months by sawing through the bars of her cell and lowering herself down with a rope made of bedsheets.[9]\nAfter her escape from the Liberty jail, Chase fled to St. Louis, Missouri, where she became involved with Walter O'Malley. On July 10, 1933, she participated in the kidnapping of banker August Luer. Chase, O'Malley, and Percy 'Dice Box' Fitzgerald drove to Mr Luer's home in Alton, Illinois. Chase, accompanied by O'Malley, rang the doorbell and requested to use the phone. When she was let in and shown the phone's location, she cut the line. O'Malley wrestled August Luer to the floor and gagged his mouth. Luer was taken to a farm where he was hidden in a damp underground cellar while his captors tried to collect a ransom for him. Luer is known to have a bad character, and fearing that he would die before they were able to receive any ransom, his kidnappers released him after 123 hours. Both Chase and O'Malley fled from Illinois back to Missouri after the bungled kidnapping. Chase eluded capture, but O'Malley was apprehended in Kansas City on May 23, 1935.[10]\nIn the early fall of 1935, Kansas City, Missouri experienced a series of drug store robberies.  The robbers were described as a man and a woman. The woman was further described as approximately 5\u00a0ft. 6 in. tall, slender, with hennaed hair. When victims were shown a photograph, they identified Chase as the female robber.\nOn November 3, 1935, Chase's body was found in a parked car at Saint Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, MO. She had been shot in the neck with a .45 caliber gun, the bullet exiting through her chest.[11] When she was found, the coroner estimated that she had only been dead 2 hours or less, leading to speculation that her killer drove her to the hospital while she was still alive, expecting her to be found before her death. She had a .22 caliber pistol on her person, with .45 caliber bullets in her handbag. Newspapers speculated that she had been double-crossed by an accomplice and was shot before she could shoot her assailant.\n",

Bustamante murdered Olten simply due to homicidal ideation and to see what it was like to kill someone. She was later indicted and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and armed criminal action and was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of conditional release in 2024 for second-degree murder. However, due to her additional conviction of armed criminal action, even if she is granted conditional release in 2024, she will have a consecutive sentence of 30 years in prison. This makes her earliest probable release in 2054, when she will be 60 years old.\nElizabeth Olten, aged nine, lived four houses down from Bustamante. On October 21, 2009, Bustamante convinced her younger sister to bring Olten to the forest by their homes to hang out. Upon Olten's arrival, Bustamante strangled Olten, slit her throat and stabbed her eight times in the chest. Bustamante then buried Olten's body in a grave that she had dug five days before in the woods behind her house and covered the grave with leaves.[3]\nAlyssa Dailene Bustamante's grandparents, Gary and Karen Brooke,[4] took legal custody of her and her three younger siblings in 2002, since her mother Michelle had addiction issues and her father Caesar was serving time in prison.[5] Friends started noticing changes in Alyssa around 2007 when she was hospitalized after a suicide attempt.[5] On her YouTube profile, she listed \"cutting\" under her hobbies.[6] She had also posted a photograph of herself on social media where she held two fingers to her head, pretending to shoot herself.\nAfter the murder, Bustamante wrote in her journal (though later attempted to scribble it out):[7]\nI just fucking killed someone.

        "paragraph": "The rapes and murders of Julie and Robin Kerry occurred on April 5, 1991, on the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in St. Louis, Missouri. The two sisters were raped and then murdered by a group of four males, who also attempted to murder the sisters' cousin.\nMarlin A. Gray (September 29, 1967 \u2013 October 26, 2005) was convicted of aiding and abetting and was executed by the U.S. state of Missouri by lethal injection. His conviction was for being a part of the group of four men involved in the murders. Gray continued to protest his innocence saying that although he was at the bridge at the time, he was smoking cannabis in a nearby car. On December 9, 1992, Gray was convicted of aiding and abetting and was executed on October 26, 2005. He maintained his innocence to the end. In 2017, DNA evidence proved he was an active participant in the crimes.\nOn the night of April 4/morning of April 5, 20-year-old Julie Kerry, 19-year-old Robin Kerry, and their 19-year-old cousin, Thomas Cummins, were on the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River. Gray, Antonio Richardson, Reginald Clemons, and Daniel Winfrey went to the bridge that night together. The two groups, who did not know each other, had a brief conversation. Gray showed the other group how to climb down a manhole cover on the bridge down to the pier. Then the two groups separated.\nAccording to testimony offered on behalf of the prosecution, several minutes later the group of four men decided to rob the three, with Winfrey testifying that Gray said he \"felt like hurting somebody.\" They returned and Gray told Cummins that \"This is a robbery. Get down on the ground.\" The two girls were grabbed and held on the ground. Richardson held Julie down while Clemons raped her and then the two swapped positions. Gray, Richardson, and Clemons then alternately raped Robin and Julie. Cummins was then robbed of his wallet, wristwatch, cash, and keys, and the three victims were forced down the manhole cover to the concrete pier. The two Kerry sisters then were pushed, and Cummins jumped as instructed. Medical witnesses testified that Cummins and Julie Kerry survived the 48-foot (15\u00a0m) fall to the water below. Cummins testified that after surfacing, the current pulled him over to Julie, but then she drifted off after he began to drown. Cummins swam to shore and survived. The body of Julie Kerry was found three weeks later near Caruthersville, Missouri; the body of Robin Kerry was not found.\nGray's version of the events was very different. In an interview in 2005, he said that after parting from the group of three, Gray went to a car where he smoked marijuana, while Richardson went to retrieve a flashlight (stolen by Richardson from a police officer's residence) he had left on the bridge. Gray returned to the bridge 30 minutes later to find that the girls and their cousin were gone. Richardson said that Cummins had said the girls had slipped off the bridge but thought the authorities would not believe this story. Cummins was then robbed by the men of his belongings. The version given by Gray at his trial was different, and also differs from what police said that he told them in his initial interview. On returning after 30 minutes in the car, Clemons informed him that \"Man, I just robbed that guy and threw him and the girls into the river.\"\nPolice initially refused to believe Thomas Cummins' version of the events. They theorized that the other men never existed and he had made up the story to cover up his attempted rape of his cousins. They believed Julie had fallen off the bridge while resisting his sexual advances, Robin had jumped in to save her, and both had drowned. Cummins was initially charged with murder but released due to lack of evidence. He later won a settlement from the St.Louis police department for wrongful interrogation techniques.[1]\nDaniel Winfrey, who was 15 years old at the time, confessed to the murder in the presence of police and his parents. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and forcible rape and testified against the other three in their trials. He received a 30-year sentence. He testified that Clemons and Richardson were the ones who had pushed the two girls. Winfrey was the only white member of the convicted group, which has been raised as a criticism since he was the main prosecution witness.[2]\nWinfrey was granted parole in the summer of 2007; when released, he had served 15 years.\nClemons was sentenced to death but his conviction was overturned in 2015. On December 18th, 2017, Clemons plead guilty to five counts: two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of rape and one count of first degree robbery. He was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. \n",

        "paragraph": "Lee Monroe Betterton (March 24, 1872 \u2013 July 9, 1920) was an American serial killer. Originally sentenced to 99 years imprisonment for killing his second wife in Missouri and suspected of having killed the first, Betterton was later paroled, remarried a third time and moved to Oklahoma, where he killed his last wife as well. He was sentenced to death for this final murder, and subsequently executed in 1920.[1]\nLee Monroe Betterton was born on March 24, 1872, in Kings Prairie Township, Missouri, one of fifteen children born to farmers Lee Land and Mary Catherine Betterton (n\u00e9e Whittingdon). Little is known about his childhood, but when he became an adult, he married a woman named Laura Elizabeth McCoy, with whom he had several children. The couple lived a seemingly normal life on a farm in Kings Prairie Township, with Betterton's only criminal convictions being for non-payment of fines.\nIn 1904, however, their marital life became strained, with the pair arguing frequently. During one such argument, an enraged Betterton beat Laura into unconsciousness, prompting neighbors to swoop in and rush her to a nearby hospital, where she soon died from her injuries.[2] For reasons unknown, Betterton was never charged in her death, and shortly after, he hired a Choctaw woman named Rose Hudson to work as a housekeeper.[3] The pair developed a liking for one another, and soon entered a de facto common law marriage. However, this relationship proved to be strained as well, as Hudson left Betterton on several occasions, but always returned to him. On December 28, 1906, after another argument between the two, Hudson left again, but felt compelled to accompany Betterton to Verona, where he had sent his children to live with their grandfather.[3] After staying with them for some time, the pair decided to return home and boarded a train. On the way, Betterton drank a few pints of whiskey, and when they disembarked at Pierce City, they decided to walk on foot to nearby Monett.[4] On the way however, Betterton and Hudson got into another argument, and in his inebriated state, Betterton pulled out a knife and stabbed her three times, causing Hudson to collapse on the ground. While she lay dying, he poured whiskey on her face until he was apprehended by the crew of a nearby passenger train.[3] The men dragged Betterton to the city jail, where he readily confessed to killing Hudson, but claimed to have been drunk at the time.[3] At his subsequent trial at Mount Vernon, Betterton pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to 99 years imprisonment.[4]\nIn spite of his long prison sentence, Betterton was among several convicted murderers who were paroled on September 25, 1917.[5] After his release, he returned to Monett, where he met a local woman named Elzadah Lockwood. The pair married at Mount Vernon on June 11, 1918, and settled at their home in the southern part of Monett.[6] To the outside world, the couple lived a seemingly happy life, with the only trouble they had experienced being their house burning down because of an accidental fire on March 26, 1919.[7]\nHowever, this proved not to be the case, as the couple divorced just several months later. On July 1, they remarried again in Mount Vernon, coincidentally on the same day as Lockwood's daughter Mayme and one of Betterton's sons, Ernest.[2] To celebrate the happy occasions, the two couples decided to visit some relatives in Vinita, Oklahoma, where the elder couple left the young newlyweds for a few days. On July 9, they returned to Vinita again for another visit.[2] While the other family members were out of the house, Betterton and his wife got into another argument, prompting him to pull out his revolver and shoot her three times.[8] After Elzadah fell to the ground, Betterton attempted to aim it at his daughter-in-law, but was prevented from doing so by Ernest, who rushed in the house and wrestled the revolver out of his father's hands.[8] When alarmed neighbors came by to check what had happened, Betterton tried to pin the murder on his son, but was unable to convince anybody and was quickly dragged to the city jail. While awaiting trial on murder charges, Betterton threatened to kill both himself and the rest of his family if he was ever let out.[8]\nBetterton's preliminary trial was scheduled for July 29, 1919, with Emery Smith acting as a prosecutor in the case.[9] After an almost three-month long trial, Betterton was found guilty of the murder and sentenced to death, with his initial execution date set for January 23, 1920.[10][11] In pronouncing the death sentence, the presiding justice expressed his disappointment at the convict's actions, reinforced by the fact that his own children testified against him.[12]\nDespite the overwhelming evidence against him, Betterton continued to profess his innocence during his incarceration on death row.[1] He was granted a stay of execution for a mental evaluation, which concluded that he was indeed sane and aware of his actions. His new execution date was set for July 9, 1920, which was coincidentally exactly a year to the exact date of his third wife's murder.[1] On the day of his execution, Betterton released a statement to the press in which he again proclaimed his innocence, but also proclaimed that he was ready to be reunited with God. At noon on the day, he was executed in the electric chair at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, the second white man to be executed in this manner in the state.[1] His final words were \"Goodbye, and God bless you all.\"[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nKevin Strickland (born June 7, 1959) is an African-American man who was wrongfully convicted by an all-white jury[2] in 1979 of killing three people in Kansas City, Missouri. No physical evidence linked him to the scene of the crime and the only alleged witness later recanted her testimony that Strickland was involved.[3][4] Strickland was given a life sentence.[5] In 2021, he garnered national attention after former prosecutors in his case said he was very likely innocent and called for his release.[3]\nTwo black men who pled guilty to the murders have said Strickland was not involved, and a fingerprint from the shotgun used in the murders belonged to someone else.[3][4] Cynthia Douglas, the sole eyewitness to the crime, said detectives pressured her into naming Strickland as a perpetrator. She attempted several times to recant her testimony before her death in 2015.[4]\nNumerous legal and political figures called for Strickland's exoneration. In June 2021, the Supreme Court of Missouri denied a petition to have him released.[5] The Governor of Missouri Mike Parson refused to pardon him, saying he did not see his case as a \"priority\" and was not certain of his innocence.[6][7][8] The office of the Missouri Attorney General fought in court to keep him in prison, saying it believed him to be guilty.[9]\nOn November 23, 2021, Judge James Welsh overturned Strickland's conviction \"since it was not based on physical evidence but on eye-witness testimony \u2026, who later recanted her account\", and Strickland was released on the same day. He was exonerated after more than 42 years in prison, \"making his case the longest confirmed wrongful-conviction case in Missouri\u2019s history\".[10][11]\nOn April 25, 1978, in Kansas City, Missouri, three people were killed when a group of assailants ransacked a house. The victims were 22-year-old Sherrie Black, 21-year-old Larry Ingram, and 20-year-old John Walker.[4] Another woman, Cynthia Douglas, Ingram's girlfriend, was shot in the leg non-fatally; she pretended to be dead until the attackers left, at which point she crawled out of the house.[4][12] All of the victims were tied up and then shot.[12] Strickland, who was then 18 years old, said at the time he was watching television and talking on the phone, and that the next morning police began accusing him of the murders.[13]\nTwo suspects, Kilm Adkins and Vincent Bell, were later arrested. Bell was a childhood friend of Strickland's, and lived at a house nearby. Police found a fingerprint belonging to Strickland on Bell's car; Strickland says this was because he had driven the car before, but the last time he had seen Adkins and Bell was at 5 or 6 p.m. on the night of the murders.[13] A fingerprint from the shotgun used in the murders belonged to someone other than Strickland who has not yet been identified.[4] Douglas, the only eyewitness, first stated she could not identify other perpetrators (two other guys) but Adkins and Bell. Later, when police arrested Strickland,[14] she picked out him in a police lineup.[15][13][16] Douglas later said she was pressured into naming him as one of the perpetrators by detectives on the case, and until her death in 2015 attempted to have her testimony recanted.[4] In 2009, she emailed the Midwest Innocence Project, saying, \"I am seeking info on how to help someone that was wrongfully accused. I was the only eyewitness and things were not clear back then, but now I know more and would like to help this person if I can.\"[13] Douglas said police told her, \"Just pick Strickland out of the lineup and we'll be done, it will all go away, you can go on and you don\u2019t have to worry about these guys no more.\"[12] Adkins and Bell confessed to the murders, but said Strickland was not a participant.[13]\nStrickland's first trial ended in a hung jury, with the only black juror refusing to find him guilty. According to Strickland, after the trial, the prosecutor approached his lawyer and said \"I'll make sure this doesn't happen next time.\"[13] Strickland's current lawyer, Tricia Rojo Bushnell of the Midwest Innocence Project, said the prosecutor used each of his peremptory challenges to strike black jurors, resulting in the next trial having an all-white jury.[13]\nStrickland was convicted in 1979, one year after being arrested, and sentenced to life imprisonment without the chance of parole for 50 years.[5][13] Adkins and Bell later cut plea bargains, pled guilty and were sentenced to 20 years, each of them serving less than 10 years. Others were suspected but not charged.[11][16] Strickland tried to appeal in 1980, but it was dismissed by Supreme Court of Missouri.[17]\n",

She has also been nicknamed \"Hope\", \"Precious Hope\", and the \"Little Jane Doe.\"[3] The victim was estimated to be between eight and eleven when she was murdered and is believed to have been killed via strangulation. She was raped and decapitated. The brutality of the crime has led to national attention.\nThe head of the Jane Doe has never been located, hindering dental examination and the possibility of a traditional facial reconstruction.[4]\nOn the afternoon of February 28, 1983, two teenage boys entered an abandoned twenty four-unit red brick building at 5635 Clemens Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri (since demolished) looking for a metal rod they could use on their go-cart; inside, they discovered the headless body of an African-American child in the home's basement.[5] The looters noticed the body after lighting a cigarette, which illuminated it; her body was naked except for a yellow sweater, and had been left lying on her stomach, with the hands bound behind her back with red and white nylon rope.\nThe victim was initially believed to have been a sex worker until police moved her body and discovered she did not have developed breasts, indicating she had not gone through puberty. Further examination was conducted within the next week.[6]\nIt was concluded by law enforcement that the victim was not killed at the location where she was discovered, as no traces of blood were found by the body.[7] This led to law enforcement to believe blood had been drained from her body elsewhere; her stomach was also empty at the time of her death.[1] The Missouri Botanical Garden performed mold tests on her body which determined she had been killed within five days of her discovery.[1]\nThe child had been bound at the wrists with a red nylon cord. Her head had been severed cleanly by a large blade, possibly a carving knife. She was between eight and eleven years old and was prepubescent; she had also been raped.[8] She wore only a yellow, long sleeved V-neck sweater and two coats of nail polish on her fingers \u2013 both of them shades of red.[9] Her head has never been found, but fingerprints, footprints and DNA information were successfully collected. There were no distinct marks or deformities on her body, she was approximately 4\u00a0feet 10\u00a0inches (1.47\u00a0m)\u00a0\u2013 5\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (1.68\u00a0m) tall when she was alive. Ten months after her discovery, with no new leads for investigators, she was buried at Washington Park Cemetery on December 2, 1983.[10][11]\nThe child's sweater had previously been sent by law enforcement to a psychic in Florida who wanted to touch it to receive a psychic impression; however, the sweater was never returned, and is presumed to have been lost in the mail.[12]\nFour missing girls have been ruled out as the victim, as well as the Northampton County Jane Doe from North Carolina, who was ruled out to be the remaining parts of the body.[13] She was also presumed to have been a victim of Vernon Brown, who had murdered a young girl in a similar manner. Brown was executed in 2005 and never confessed to murdering the Jane Doe, despite efforts made by investigators.[12]\nAuthorities decided to exhume the body in 2013 in order to gather more forensic information about the victim. The remains had been misplaced, along with many other bodies in the Washington Park Cemetery, due to the negligence of cemetery records and were not found until mid June.[14][15][16] The remains were located by using camera calibration techniques to determine precisely where a photograph of the casket had been taken on the day of the burial.[17]\n",

His cousin Bob Klinger was also a Major League Baseball player.[1]\nHollocher helped the Cubs win the National League pennant in 1918. (In that year the professional baseball season was prematurely curtailed due to World War I.) That season he led the National League in games (131), at bats (509), hits (161), total bases (202), singles (130) and runs created (76, although this statistic was a retroactive metric).\nIn 1922 he led the National League in at bats per strikeout (118.4), which to this day remains the Cubs' single season record. His five strikeouts for the entire season remains the National League record by a player with a minimum of 150 games.[2]\nHollocher left the Cubs in August 1923 due to depression, apparently linked to an undiagnosed intestinal disorder. He tried a comeback in 1924, but was unable to complete the season.\nHe killed himself in Frontenac, Missouri, on August 14, 1940,[3] when he shot himself in the throat.

A mob grabbed the unconscious Wright, poured gasoline on him, and burned him in front of Smiths Chapel.[2] Threats were made to other blacks of the city, and many fled the city. Others armed themselves and guarded the entrance to their neighborhood. Governor Forrest Donnell directed the Missouri State Highway Patrol and Sheriff John Hobbs to assign additional men to the scene. Nearly 100 residents who fled never returned to the community.\nAfterwards, blacks who had armed themselves and patrolled the community opened a chapter of the NAACP, seeking protection from mob violence. The white community considered the killing justified. Church leaders, while generally negative on the righteousness of lynching, were afraid to speak out one way or the other due to the fear it would \"drive a wedge\" between members.[3]\n\n\nThis United States biographical article related to crime is a stub.

He was one of three children, having two sisters.  After high school, Valencia worked as a model.  \nAt the time of his death, Valencia was a 23-year-old junior at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Boone County, Missouri.  While at the university, Valencia studied pre-law and journalism; he also worked at the Campus Inn Motel.\nValencia is buried on the family farm in Perryville, Kentucky.[2]\nSteven Arthur Rios (born 1977), a Columbia police officer regarded well by his division and with a wife and newborn baby at the time of the murder, was convicted of Valencia's murder in September 2004.[3]  Rios was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for the murder and to a consecutive ten-year sentence for a related charge (for use of a weapon during commission of the crime). His conviction was later overturned after a judge ruled hearsay was admitted into evidence during his first trial. A retrial led to Rios' conviction of second-degree murder and armed criminal action, resulting in another life imprisonment and an additional twenty-three-year sentence.\nValencia was openly gay at his college, which was supported by the people he loved, and he would date and have casual intimate relationships during his time in college. Rios was called to break up a party two months before Valencia's murder. Valencia was attending and opposed the raid, so Rios arrested him. After asking numerous personal questions of Valencia on the drive down to the station, Rios offered the next day to disappear the charges if Rios solicited sex from Valencia.\nRios would continuously arrive unannounced at Valencia's living space without warning, where sexual exchanges would occur before Rios slipped away each time. One of Valencia's casual partners, Andy Schermerhorn, was present during one of the visits and coerced into participating in the sexual activities, with Valencia swearing him to silence. Valencia spoke with his mother, Linda, about the extortion and described it as \"stalking\", yet he knew little to nothing about Rios, possibly including his name. As the charges weren't dropped, Valencia was ready to report Rios to his department, which he told his friend Joan Sheridan.[4]\nValencia left his shift at the motel, then made his way to a campus party. He had drank at the party and was making his way back on foot, having called one of his partners, Ed McDevitt, on the night in question. Valencia was found dead between two campus buildings by a group of students during the morning, estimated to have been killed some time shortly before dawn. His throat was slashed with a serrated knife, deep enough to scrape his spine. He had no defensive wounds, but strangulation marks on his throat revealed he was choked before he was slashed. Rios was one of the first officers to identify Valencia after he died.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard (n\u00e9e Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield,[2] lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and who had the \"mental capacity of a 7-year-old due to brain damage\" as the result of premature birth.\nAfter reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult and did not have any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.[3]\nFurther investigation found that some of the doctors who had examined Gypsy Rose had found no evidence of the claimed disorders. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nDee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent.[4] Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence;[1] after a brief trial in November 2018, Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[5]\nDee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow.[6] Blanchard was one of five children of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr. and Emma Lois Gisclair.[7]\nRelatives recalled that she had a habit of stealing from her family, which they speculated was a form of retaliation when \"things didn't go her way\".[8] At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse's aide.[3] The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food.[8]\nWhen she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses.[a] Shortly before Gypsy Rose's birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod realized he \"got married for the wrong reasons\". He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.[3]\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder.[3] At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker.[9]\n",

It was replaced by the Jefferson City Correctional Center, which opened on September 15, 2004.[3]\nThe Missouri State Penitentiary was designed by John Haviland and constructed in the early 1830s to serve the newly admitted (1821) state of Missouri. Jefferson City had been designated the state capital in 1822, and Governor John Miller suggested that the state's main prison be constructed there to help the city maintain its somewhat tenuous status against other towns trying to obtain the capitol for themselves.[4] James Dunnica, a master stonemason who built the first Capitol building in Jefferson City in 1826, was appointed to oversee construction of the new prison, and $25,000 was allotted by the legislature for expenses.[4] The facility opened for business in March 1836, the same month as the fall of the Alamo in Texas.\nPrisoners were employed during the 1830s in making bricks; the initial prison population consisted of one guard, one warden, fifteen prisoners, and a foreman for the brick-making operation with an assistant. Eleven of the fifteen prisoners were from St. Louis, and all were incarcerated for larceny except for one, who was imprisoned for stabbing a man during a drunken brawl.\nIn 1868, A-Hall, also known as Housing Unit A and Housing Unit 4, was finished. The building was constructed of stone quarried on site and built mainly by inmates. Warden Horace Swift was the architect of the structure. It is still standing today, and housed inmates until the day the prison was closed.\nIn its daily \"Times Past\" column, the Irish Times ran the following column in 1990 and 2000:\nTired of Irish Stew\nJefferson City, Missouri.\nSome five hundred more convicts at the Missouri State Penitentiary mutinied to-day. Seven hundred and fifty prisoners in the same institution struck yesterday, following on the refusal of their demand for grilled meat instead of the continual Irish stew, and refused to leave the dining hall, though they were subsequently persuaded to disperse peaceably by the Governor.\nThe prisoners to-day, who demand better food and better working conditions, downed tools at all the prison factories. They were quickly marched back to their cells.\n",

At age 34, Adams was surrounded and then killed by police in Wichita, Kansas.[2]\nEdward James \"Eddie\" Adams was born in 1887 on a farm in Hutchinson, Kansas, as William Joseph Wallace. His father died when he was young, and his mother remarried. He had a strong disdain for his stepfather, as well as for physical labor. He learned the barber trade and moved to Wichita in the early 20th century. There, he met John Callahan, and quickly became involved in bootlegging, petty robberies, and car theft.\nAdams was handsome and charismatic, and attracted many women and hangers-on. His wife left him after growing weary of his illegal activities and infidelities.\nHe soon formed his own gang and began committing bank and train robberies throughout Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa, eventually earning a reputation as the premier bandit in the Midwest by the early days of Prohibition.\nIn 1920, through Callahan, Adams formed a partnership with outlaw brothers Ray and Walter Majors, and, on September 5, attempted a daylight robbery against a notorious Kansas City gambling den on Grand Avenue owned by Harry Trusdell. However, a shootout between the bandits and tough employees of the illegal casino  resulted in the death of gambler and gunman Frank Gardner and the eventual capture of the gang by police.[citation needed]\nAdams was sentenced to life imprisonment in February 1921. The Majors brothers received lesser sentences by agreeing to plead guilty to robbery, and were both sentenced to five years' imprisonment. Both brothers  eventually died in prison. A third Majors brother involved in the botched robbery attempt, Dudley, escaped from the scene, only to be later arrested and serve time in Delaware.\nWhile being transported to the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City, Missouri, Adams escaped custody by jumping off the train, and several days later joined Julius Finney in the robbery of a bank and general store in Cullison, Kansas, on February 11, 1921. He was captured on February 17, 1921, near Garden Plain, Kansas, by a posse, after wrecking a stolen car under a bridge. Convicted of bank robbery, Adams was sentenced to serve 10 to 30 years at the Kansas State Penitentiary in Lansing, in addition to his life sentence in Missouri for murder.\nOn August 13, Adams once again successfully escaped imprisonment after sabotaging the prison power plant and scaling the prison walls during the night, along with inmates Frank Foster, George Weisberger, and D.C. Brown. The driver of the getaway car was Billy Fintelman, a World War I veteran who had turned to a life of crime. With the exception of Brown (who was recaptured days later), the fugitives  eluded capture from state authorities and eventually formed what  became the newest incarnation of the Adams gang.\nBy September of that year, joined by Fintelman, the gang robbed around $10,000 from banks in Rose Hill and Haysville, Kansas. During the Haysville robbery, Adams pistol-whipped 82-year-old James Krievell for no apparent reason, who later died of a fractured skull.[citation needed]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJohn Wesley Robinson (1867 \u2013 February 15, 1915) was an American serial killer. Originally sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for killing his girlfriend in St. Louis, Missouri in 1896, Robinson would gain notoriety for the double murder of his wife and stepdaughter in Kansas City in 1913. Due to the severity of the latter crime, he was convicted, sentenced to death and subsequently executed for it in 1915.\nOn the early morning of June 16, 1896, Robinson was suddenly awakened by his girlfriend Ella Jones, who had come to his house to ask him to get her some medicine. When he refused to do so, she accused him of seeing other women, causing Robinson to retaliate by claiming that she was cheating on him and that she planned to poison him.[1] Their arguing quickly turned violent, with Robinson managing to get a tight grip around her neck and choke her to death. He then went to have a glass of water, but was spooked by a breeze that led him to believe that Jones was still alive. Robinson then grabbed a soaked sponge and shoved it down her throat to ensure that she would choke to death. He then went to sleep, with his girlfriend's corpse lying right next to him in bed.[1]\nOn the following morning, he closed the blinds and left the house, spending most of the day getting drunk.[1] When he sobered up on the next day, Robinson returned to the house and tore up two planks from the kitchen floor and started digging a shallow grave in it. After some time, he eventually gave up and went back to the body, which he carried over to the hole and dumped it inside. Robinson then put a quilt over it, covered it with dirt, and promptly left. Over the next few days, Robinson grew paranoid that somebody would notice that she was missing, so he packed his belongings and left St. Louis, just before Jones' body was found by concerned neighbors.[2]\nThe day after the discovery, Robinson boarded a steamboat bound for Quincy, Illinois, but was arrested en route by a detective who recognized him. By that time, news of the murder had spread all around the city, causing great anger and outrage amongst the city's white and black communities. While he was being escorted to the Central Police Station, a lynch mob of more than 1,000 people had gathered and threatened to kill Robinson, forcing the detectives to arm themselves in order to discourage them.[2] While Robinson feared that he would be killed by the angry mob, he appeared to be completely emotionless when questioned by detectives, explaining what had happened to Jones in a calm, collected manner.[2]\nIn subsequent interviews, Robinson began to claim that he was not the one who had shoved the sponge down Jones' throat. As he had been truthful up until then, detectives summarized that this act might have been done by a friend of his - James \"Temp\" Temples, who had previously told Robinson that he needed to treat his girlfriend more harshly.[3] After he refused to testify at the coroner's inquest, it was ordered that Robinson should be transferred back to his jail cell at the Central Police Station, but as another mob was forming along the way, investigators had to take another path to there. Upon their arrival, an even bigger crowd had gathered to take a look at the confessed murderer - while the detectives were attempting to hold them back, a spectator managed to sneak from behind and hit Robinson in the back of the head.[3] This greatly frightened the convict, who started begging for his life, but the situation was deescalated and he was safely returned to his cell.[3]\nThree days later, Temples was arrested for the unrelated murder of a man after losing a game of craps. When questioned, he offered another version of the story: in his account, Robinson came to him and asked to sleep next to him for the night so he would not be lonely, but during the night, Robinson attempted to choke him to death.[4] Temples said that he managed to overpower him and threatened to cut his throat if he tried to do that again, which successfully dissuaded his friend.[4] Despite this admission, Robinson remained the sole man charged with the case, but was allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder after striking a deal with Circuit Attorney William Zachritz. As a result, he was convicted of the second-degree murder charge and sentenced to serve 15 years at a state penitentiary.[5] The move was heavily criticized by law enforcement officers, all of whom felt that Robinson's crime was so severe that he deserved to be executed.[5]\nAfter serving 11 years of his sentence at the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City, Robinson was paroled on January 12, 1908. Sometime afterwards, he moved to Kansas City, where he met and soon married Mary Felton. The pair resided on 2213 Michigan Avenue together with her daughter from a previous marriage, 11-year-old Alma.[6]\nTheir marriage proved to be very rocky, as Mary frequently accused Robinson of cheating on her. Fearing that she would attempt to have him returned to jail, he decided to get rid of her. On the evening of April 11, 1913, Robinson got a butcher knife and went to his wife's room, where he choked her to death in her sleep.[6] After assuring himself that she was dead, he proceeded to sever her arms and legs. He then went to Alma's room, where he choked her to death and dismembered her as well. After burning the arms and legs in the stove, he buried Mary's body in the backyard before shoving Alma's remains in a bag. He then went to a nearby pasture and buried them in a shallow grave near a pond.[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U.S. 361 (1989), was a United States Supreme Court case that sanctioned the imposition of the death penalty on offenders who were at least 16 years of age at the time of the crime.[1]  This decision came one year after Thompson v. Oklahoma, in which the Court had held that a 15-year-old offender could not be executed because to do so would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In 2003, the Governor of Kentucky Paul E. Patton commuted the death sentence of Kevin Stanford, an action followed by the Supreme Court two years later in Roper v. Simmons overruling Stanford and holding that all juvenile offenders are exempt from the death penalty.\nThe case involved the shooting death of 20-year-old Barbel Poore in Jefferson County, Kentucky. Kevin Stanford committed the murder on January 7, 1981, when he was approximately 17 years and 4 months of age. Stanford and his accomplice repeatedly raped and sodomized Poore during and after their commission of a robbery at a gas station where she worked as an attendant. They then drove her to a secluded area near the station, where Stanford shot her pointblank in the face and then in the back of her head. The proceeds from the robbery were roughly 300 cartons of cigarettes, two gallons of fuel, and a small amount of cash.\nAfter Stanford's arrest, a Kentucky juvenile court conducted hearings to determine whether he should be transferred for trial as an adult, and, stressing the seriousness of his offenses and his long history of past delinquency, found that certification for trial as an adult to be in the best interest of Stanford and the community.\nStanford was convicted of murder, first-degree sodomy, first-degree robbery, and receiving stolen property, and was sentenced to death and 45 years in prison. The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence, rejecting Stanford's \"deman[d] that he has a constitutional right to treatment\". Finding that the record clearly demonstrated that \"there was no program or treatment appropriate for the appellant in the juvenile justice system\", the court held that the juvenile court did not err in certifying Stanford for trial as an adult. The court also stated that Stanford's \"age and the possibility that he might be rehabilitated were mitigating factors appropriately left to the consideration of the jury that tried him\".\nOral arguments were heard 27 March 1989. Prior to the hearing, briefs of amici curiae pushing for reversal were filed by the American Baptist Churches, the Child Welfare League of America, and the West Virginia Council of Churches. Briefs supporting the affirmation of the capital sentence were filed by the Attorney General of Kentucky and a number of attorneys general from other states.\nIn both cases, briefs of amici curiae were put forth by the American Bar Association, the American Society for Adolescent Psychiatry, the International Human Rights Group, and Amnesty International.\nArguments in the defense of petitioners Stanford and Wilkins (see below) were that the application of capital punishment upon defendants who were minors at the time of the offense was unconstitutional because it violated the prohibition of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[1]\nIn both Stanford v. Kentucky, and the parallel case Wilkins v. Missouri, the Supreme Court affirmed the capital punishments handed down in lower courts. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that neither Stanford or Wilkins asserted that the punishment was cruel or unusual at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted (common law at the time set the incapacity to commit a felony at age 14), and so both petitioners were left to argue that capital punishment for minors older than 14, was contrary to \"the evolving standards of decency\". This expanse in the review of the Eighth Amendment was not granted in this decision, and Scalia went on to cite precedent limits set in Gregg v. Georgia (1976).[2]\nWe discern neither a historical nor a modern societal consensus forbidding the imposition of capital punishment on any person who murders at 16 or 17 years of age. Accordingly, we conclude that such punishment does not offend the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. ... and to mean that as the dissent means it, i.e., that it is for us to judge, not on the basis of what we perceive the Eighth Amendment originally prohibited, or on the basis of what we perceive the society through its democratic processes now overwhelmingly disapproves, but on the basis of what we think \"proportionate\" and \"measurably contributory to acceptable goals of punishment\" \u2013 to say and mean that, is to replace judges of the law with a committee of philosopher-kings.\n",

Convicted of murdering a young girl and a man in both Missouri and Kansas, Priest is also suspected, but acquitted, in another three murders dating from 1980 to 1985. He is currently serving two life sentences at the Lansing Correctional Facility in Lansing, Kansas.[1]\nOn June 15, 1980, the body of 12-year-old Tonya Lea Lewis, a student at Nevada Middle School, was found floating on a farm pond about 11 miles south of the city by two men who had gone fishing. According to the Vernon County Sheriff Department, she had died about two days prior.[2] Initially, the cause of death couldn't be determined and no obvious signs of wounds could be located after the autopsy, but the authorities nevertheless treated the case as a suspected homicide.[3] Almost a month later, 22-year-old local Martin Priest was arrested for the death, now determined to be a drowning, remaining in custody with a $250,000 bond.\nAt the time, Priest was part of a painting crew and was working in the Lewis household when he overheard a conversation between Tonya and a friend, Kelly Schumacher, who wanted to go to the municipal pool. He excused himself before his boss with a supposed job interview, but instead went to see Tonya, allegedly making arrangements for the two of them to play basketball later. After Lewis failed to return home, her mother, Shirley, questioned Martin about the disappearance, but he explained that after he left their supposed game, he went home and stayed there all night.[1]\nOn the day Tonya had disappeared, he had been jailed on charges of forgery and theft.[4] While awaiting his capital murder trial, Priest's third wife, 32-year-old Genieve, attempted to break him out of jail on August 5. She struck the prison guard on the back of the head and demanded that they release her husband. The jailer refused, and she then fled, but was later arrested and charged with attempted prison escape.[5] On March 5, 1981, Priest was convicted of Lewis' murder and sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. He filed for retrial twice, but both motions were denied by Justice William Kimberlin.[6] The following year, Genieve committed suicide. In 1983, Martin filed another retrial, but this time successfully received an acquittal - since no cause of death could be determined, there was no conclusive proof that she hadn\u2019t died accidentally, and thus, he was released.[7]\nOn May 16, 1984, the 14-year-old Rothganger disappeared while walking to school from her home in Eldon.[8] She was last seen entering Priest's car, which was additionally occupied by his nephew, 13-year-old David Nicholas. According to Nicholas, Priest knocked the girl unconscious with a wrench, before proceeding to rape and strangle her. He then abandoned the body at a local residence, but he then returned to the dump site and disposed of it in another location.[8]\nPriest is the prime suspect in three other murders, all of which he has nonetheless been acquitted.\nOn November 16, 1984, 15-year-old Katrina Cheely mysteriously vanished after leaving for Allison Junior High School in Wichita, Kansas. Originally from Binghamton, New York, Katrina moved to Wichita in December 1983 to live with her mother, and was described as a nice friendly girl. Her partly decomposed nude body was discovered in a culvert by a farmer on February 28, 1985, after he decided to inspect what his dog had barked at for the last month. She was positively identified as Cheely from a school book and a ring she was wearing.[9] The forensic examiner, Dr. William Eckert, determined that she had been asphyxiated, but hadn't been sexually assaulted.[10]\nMartin and Katrina's mother, Linda Hall, had met in 1984, shortly after the former moved to Wichita. Hall, who described her new boyfriend as a very nice person, noted that on the day of her daughter's disappearance, Martin was at the home. Katrina was running late for school, and he had offered her a ride there.[11] According to testimony from Martin's fourth wife, Debra Yoder, he bragged to her that he had driven around the neighborhood and then tried to molest Katrina. When she resisted, he strangled her with her own pantyhose.[7]\nOn December 27\u201328, two bodies were found to the north-northwest part of Wichita. Both victims had been shot, which led to speculation that the deaths were related. The male victim, 25-year-old William H. Mayhugh, was found in a ditch near the Arkansas River, with a single gunshot wound to the head. He was discovered by flood control supervisor Bob Jennings while he was checking the floodways. According to Jennings, it was likely that Mayhugh had been in there since the weekend, as he still wore clothes suited for the cold weather.[12] The following day, 33-year-old Frieda Bayliff was discovered dead at the home the couple shared. She had been strangled to death.[13] Both were last seen by relatives on Christmas.\n",

        "paragraph": "Thomas Biddle (November 21, 1790 \u2013 August 29, 1831) was an American military hero during the War of 1812. Biddle is better known though for having been killed in a duel with Missouri Congressman Spencer Pettis.\nThomas Biddle was born into the powerful Biddle family in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, one of ten children born to Charles and Hannah (Shephard) Biddle.[1] \nHis father Charles was a Revolutionary War officer and vice-president of the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Two of Thomas' brothers, James and Edward, had served in the U.S. Navy, while brother John was a U.S. Army officer before becoming an early mayor of Detroit, Michigan. Older brother Nicholas Biddle was president of the Second Bank of the United States.[2]\nDuring the War of 1812, Thomas Biddle was commissioned, as a captain of artillery, under Zebulon Pike. He saw action, at Fort George and Stoney Creek and was wounded, at Fort Erie. Biddle was wounded again at the Battle of Lundy's Lane, where he distinguished himself by capturing the only British cannon seized in the clash. It would later be preserved and displayed in Washington, D.C.[2] In 1814 Biddle was brevetted to the rank of Major and became an aide for George Izard. In 1819, he accompanied the Yellowstone Expedition up the Missouri River to the vicinity of present-day Omaha, Nebraska.[3][4]  In August, 1820 he was transferred to St. Louis, Missouri where he served as U.S. Army paymaster.\nOn September 1, 1823 Thomas Biddle married Ann Mullanphy, daughter of Missouri's first millionaire, John Mullanphy. Now serving as the director of the St. Louis branch of the Bank of the United States, the Biddles were financially well-off and at the peak of young St. Louis society, often hosting lavish dinner parties for business and political luminaries. It was their involvement in local politics that would have deadly consequences, however.\nWhat transpired on August 26, 1831 had its roots many months earlier. Missouri's Jacksonian Democrats, led by Senator Thomas Hart Benton, engaged in a number of debates, during the 1830 Congressional election season, that saw many fiery speeches, on issues of banking, currency stability, and western land use. During one of those speeches, Congressman Spencer Darwin Pettis, a Benton acolyte, harshly criticized Biddle's brother Nicholas, President of the Second Bank of the United States.[5]\nA war of words soon ensued, in the St. Louis press, in the form of letters to the editor. In one such letter, Thomas Biddle called Pettis \"a dish of skimmed milk\", to which Pettis responded by questioning Thomas Biddle's manhood.[2] Pettis was reelected to U.S. Congress, in November, 1830, but the feud between the two refused to die. Things escalated dramatically on July 9, 1831, when Biddle heard that an ill Pettis was resting in a St. Louis hotel. Biddle attacked Pettis in his room, beating him severely with a cowhide whip until other hotel guests intervened.\n[6]\nFearing that he might be attacked again during his recovery, Congressman Pettis had Major Biddle arrested on a peace warrant. At the court proceedings, Pettis attempted to draw a pistol with the intention of shooting Biddle, but was restrained by friends. At this, Biddle stated that he would promptly accept any challenge that the Congressman cared to issue.[6]\nAfter sufficient time to recover from the beating, on August 21, 1831, Congressman Pettis challenged Biddle to a duel, which was promptly accepted. As the challenged party, Biddle chose the weapons and distance. Being nearsighted, he chose pistols at the unusually close distance of 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m).[5] This meant that each man would take at most one or two steps before turning to fire, with their pistols perhaps even overlapping, depending on arm length. In short, it was suicidal and seen as a ploy by some observers and later historians to make Pettis back down and thus lose the affair of honor without bloodshed.[7]\nAt five p.m. on August 27, 1831, Biddle and Pettis, along with their seconds, Major Benjamin O'Fallon and Captain Martin Thomas, respectively, met on Bloody Island, a small sandbar located in the Mississippi River between St. Louis and the Illinois shore. Dueling was illegal in both states, but authorities tended to turn a blind eye to this neutral ground. As large crowds watched from the St. Louis riverfront, Biddle and Pettis obeyed the commands to step, turn, and fire. Both men fell with mortal wounds.[6] Before being carried off the island, both men were overheard to forgive each other for the altercation. \n",

Griffin was executed by lethal injection on June 21, 1995. Griffin maintained his innocence right up to his execution.\nAfter Griffin's execution, a 2005 post-execution investigation was sponsored by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.

He was the youngest of Jesse James and Lula Novada (Bomar) Hatcher's four children. His father was a bootlegger,[3] an ex\u2011convict and an abusive alcoholic. Hatcher was bullied in school, and in turn bullied his classmates and would carry this practice into adulthood.[4]\nIn the spring of 1936, he and his older brothers were flying a kite with copper wire they had found in an old Model\u00a0T Ford. His oldest brother, Arthur Allen, was about to hand the kite to him when it hit a high\u2011voltage power line and electrocuted him. Arthur was pronounced dead at the scene. Soon afterward, his father left home and divorced his mother. His mother remarried several times, and in 1945, Hatcher moved with his mother and her third husband to St.\u00a0Joseph.[1]\nIn 1947, Hatcher was convicted of auto theft in St.\u00a0Joseph after stealing a logging truck from Iowa\u2013Missouri Walnut Company, his employer of two weeks. He received a two\u2011year suspended sentence. In 1948, he was convicted of auto theft a second time for stealing a 1937 Buick in St.\u00a0Joseph. Hatcher was sentenced to two years in the Missouri State Penitentiary.[1]\nOn June 8, 1949, Hatcher was released from prison after serving a little more than half of his time. He was back in prison in just a few months, after being convicted of forging a $10 check at a gas station in Maryville, Missouri. On March 18, 1951, Hatcher escaped from prison and attempted a burglary. He was caught and received an extra two years in prison.[1]\nAfter serving his additional time, Hatcher was released from prison on July 14, 1954. He stole a 1951 Ford in Orrick and was subsequently sentenced to four years in prison. Before he was sentenced, Hatcher attempted to escape from the Ray County Jail in Richmond and received an additional two years. On March 18, 1959, Hatcher was released from prison after the sixth prison sentence of his life.[1]\nOn June 26, 1959, Hatcher attempted to abduct Steven Pellham, a 16\u2011year\u2011old in St.\u00a0Joseph who delivered newspapers, threatening him with a butcher knife. Pellham reported the crime, and Hatcher was arrested when the police stopped him in a stolen vehicle.[1]\nHatcher was sentenced to five years in the Missouri State Penitentiary for the attempted abduction and auto theft under the Habitual Criminal Act. While Hatcher was waiting to be transported to prison, he unsuccessfully attempted to break out of the Buchanan County Jail. When Hatcher arrived at the Missouri State Penitentiary, he claimed to be the most notorious criminal in northwest Missouri since Jesse James.[1]\nOn July 2, 1961, a 26-year-old inmate named Jerry Tharrington was found raped and stabbed to death on the floor of the prison kitchen loading dock.[5] He had been repeatedly stabbed in the back.[4] Hatcher was the only individual missing from the kitchen crew at the time of the murder. He was sent to solitary confinement for Tharrington's murder, but there was not enough evidence to convict him in court.[1]\n",

He earned a civil engineering degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, then moved to Wisconsin and became a civil engineer and lumberman. After successfully building a log dam on the Wisconsin River for use by lumber raftsmen, he and his wife, Mary, purchased several tracts of land in Kilbourn, Wisconsin (now Wisconsin Dells). He built a home in town with acreage that stretched northward up River Road which included the site of present-day Meadowbrook Resort. Politically, he was a Democrat.[1]\nBailey entered the Union Army at the beginning of the war as captain of Company D of the 4th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment. He served as part of Major General Benjamin F. Butler's Army of the Gulf, which occupied New Orleans after Admiral David Farragut captured the city in April 1862. Bailey was named acting chief engineer for the city of New Orleans shortly after its occupation.\nPromoted to major in May 1863, Bailey contributed to the Union Army's engineering activities in support of the Siege of Port Hudson. In August 1863, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel when the regiment was redesignated as the 4th Wisconsin Cavalry Regiment.\nBailey's engineering skills during Major General Nathaniel P. Banks' ill-fated 1864 Red River Campaign are considered the reason the campaign did not result in the loss of the entire 30,000-man Army of the Gulf. Having landed his forces at Simmesport, Louisiana in March with the intention of moving north along the Red River some 200 miles to capture Shreveport, the headquarters of Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith, Banks was repulsed at the Battle of Mansfield on April 8, 1864, by Confederate General Richard Taylor and his force of just 12,000 men.\nRetreating down the Red River, Banks found the low river level at Alexandria prohibited the passage of Commander David Dixon Porter's fleet of ten Federal gunboats, part of the Union Army's Mississippi Squadron. Hounded by Taylor's forces in the rear, Banks faced the humiliating necessity of abandoning Porter's fleet. Without the fleet's supporting firepower, his entire Army would risk capture before it could return to safety in New Orleans.\nResigned to his fate, Banks reluctantly listened to Porter's suggestion to give Bailey's idea a try. Bailey suggested building a wing dam, similar to those he had built as a Wisconsin lumberman. The dam, Bailey argued, would raise the level of the river. When it was high enough to carry Porter's fleet over the falls, Bailey would blow up the dam, and the fleet would be saved.\nPersuaded by Porter, Banks agreed to the plan. For ten days, 10,000 troops worked feverishly on both banks of the River to build the dam. Finally, on May 10, 1864, the river rose, the dam was broken, and the fleet floated past. Porter's fleet and Banks' army were saved. The ruins of Bailey's Dam can be seen to this day in Alexandria.\nA grateful United States Congress voted Bailey the Thanks of Congress, making him only one of fifteen army officers to receive such an honor during the Civil War. Of those he was the only who did not command an army or corps at the time. The original Thanks of Congress signed by Abraham Lincoln can be seen on display at the Bank of Wisconsin Dells; other memorabilia and artifacts are displayed at the Dells Country Historical Museum at the Bowman House, and at Meadowbrook Resort in Wisconsin Dells.\n",

It is a one-story, Greek Revival style frame dwelling measuring 24 feet, 2 inches, wide and 30 feet, 4 inches, deep.[2]\nAt the time, the house was located at 1318 Lafayette Street in St. Joseph.[3] In 1939, it was moved to a busier Belt Highway location. In 1977, it was moved to a location directly behind Patee House at 12th and Mitchell in St. Joseph, only two blocks away from its original location, which restored more of its historic context.\nThe investigation into the shooting death of James was conducted at Patee House Hotel (formerly the World's Hotel).  Mrs. James, her two children, and Jesse's mother stayed in Patee House for two nights after Jesse James was killed.\nThe house has a large bullet hole on the north interior wall.  The hole was actually much smaller but over the years, souvenir hunters carved shavings from the hole and enlarged it.\nThe Jesse James Home contains a number of items owned by Jesse James and his family.  In 1995, top forensic scientist Professor James E. Starrs, of George Washington University, conducted an exhumation of the grave of Jesse James to settle persistent controversy about the remains. In February 1996, he announced that DNA tests performed on the remains and compared to the DNA of existing known relatives proved a 99.7% reliability that the body in the grave was that of Jesse James.  The museum includes new exhibits based on the 1995 exhumation, including artifacts such as coffin handles, bits of wood, and a pin Jesse James wore in his death photo, as well as numerous photos taken during the exhumation.\nThe home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1980.[1] It is a contributing resource to the Patee Town Historic District.[4]\n",

Others say Miller became drunk one night and told a marshal about a train robbery that was to take place in the near future. The Times story speculated that a woman was involved.

Thousands of people attended a candlelight vigil for Hailey on February 23, 2014. A neighborhood park was later dedicated to her called Hailey's Playground. Her family and friends also advocated for improvements to the state's AMBER Alert system, ultimately leading to the 2019 passage of HAILEY'S Law, which empowers law enforcement officers to issue alerts more quickly and to include a URL with each AMBER alert.[3]\nHailey was born to parents Stacey Barfield and Ryan Owens in Springfield, Missouri. Hailey was a fourth grader at Westport Elementary at the time of her death. In a news interview, Hailey's mother said she enjoyed helping her babysit and loved little kids. Her mother also stated that Hailey was always smiling, laughing, and willing to help anyone in any way she could.[4]\nAt about 5:00\u00a0p.m. on February 18, 2014, Hailey was walking home from a friend's house when a man in a truck pulled over, called to her, and asked for directions. As she approached him, he grabbed her, threw her into his truck, and sped away. Michelle and Carlos Edwards were talking in their garage when they saw a gold Ford Ranger truck pull up, and the driver grabbed Hailey. Michelle wrote down the license plate number, and Carlos ran after the truck while another neighbor jumped in a vehicle and followed until the truck eluded him. \nAs Michelle called 911, Carlos knocked on doors trying to find the girl's parents, the search warrant application said. He described the girl to a boy who said it sounded like his sister and took Carlos to his home to talk with his mother. The license plate number led police to Jim and Regina Wood, who informed them that their son Craig Wood was the primary driver of that vehicle.\nHailey's body was found in Craig Michael Wood's home in Springfield. It was inside two garbage bags within plastic storage containers in the basement of the house. She had been raped and shot in the back of the head.[5] There were marks on her wrists indicating that, at some point, she had been tied up.[6] There is video footage of Wood disposing of Hailey's clothing in a dumpster. There is also footage of him buying two bottles of bleach and Liquid Plummer on two separate trips.\nThe suspect in the murder was Craig Michael Wood (born March 25, 1968).[7] He was 49 years old at the time of his conviction. Wood once worked in Springfield as a paraprofessional worker and worked for 16 years as a school football coach at Pleasant View Middle School.[6] He also worked there supervising suspensions and as a teacher's aide and substitute teacher.[8]\nPolice found over a dozen firearms in his home, as well as child pornography.[8] While searching a bedroom dresser in Wood's home, they discovered stories about sexual fantasies. Two of these handwritten stories involved girls aged 13. Also found were four pictures of young female students who attended the school where Wood had been employed.[9]\nWood had a criminal record. In 1990, he pleaded guilty and was fined $100 after being found in possession of a controlled substance. In 2001, he was convicted of the misdemeanor of stealing wildlife.[8]\n",

Delo, 513 U.S. 298 (1995), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court expanded the ability to reopen a case in light of new evidence of innocence.[1]\nPetitioner Lloyd E. Schlup, Jr., a Missouri prisoner under a sentence of death for the 1984 murder of an inmate named Arthur Dade, filed a habeas corpus petition alleging that constitutional error deprived the jury of critical evidence that would have established his innocence. At trial, the state's evidence consisted of the testimony of two corrections officers who had witnessed the murder. Schlup's defense was that the videotape from a camera in the dining room showed that he was not the man that killed Arthur Dade. Schlup was denied his federal habeas corpus petition and filed a second petition alleging ineffective counsel. However, he did not argue his ineffective counsel claim in his first habeas corpus petition. Due to this, he was procedurally barred from arguing his case unless he could show that he was actually innocent and his conviction would be a miscarriage of justice. The Court granted certiorari to consider whether the Sawyer v. Whitley[2] standard provides adequate protection against the kind of miscarriage of justice that would result from the execution of a person who is actually innocent.\nThe Court held[1] that the standard of Murray v. Carrier,[3] which requires a habeas petitioner to show that \"a constitutional violation has probably resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent,\" id., at 496\u2014rather than the more stringent Sawyer standard, governs the miscarriage of justice inquiry when a petitioner who has been sentenced to death raises a claim of actual innocence to avoid a procedural bar to the consideration of the merits of his constitutional claims. The exception is dependent on the petitioner's credible showing of innocence with reliable evidence. To meet the standard in Murray v. Carrier, the petitioner must show that it is more likely than not that no juror would have convicted given the new evidence. The Supreme Court remanded for determination of whether Schlup showed this evidence as required by Carrier. \nIn 1996, Schlup was granted a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that his original trial attorney failed to adequately represent him. In 1999, on the second day of his re-trial, Schlup agreed to plead guilty to second degree murder which allowed him to avoid the death penalty.[4] Sclup's co-defendant, Robert Earl O'Neal, was executed for his role in Dade's murder in 1995.[5]\nThis article related to the Supreme Court of the United States is a stub.

        "paragraph": "The 1968 Kansas City riot occurred in Kansas City, Missouri, in April 1968. Kansas City became one of 37 cities in the United States to be the subject of rioting after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The rioting in Kansas City did not erupt on April 4, like other cities of the United States affected directly by the assassination, but rather on April 9 after local events within the city.[1][2]\nThe first sign of disorder in the streets of Kansas City was a relatively stable student march, in response to the government failing to close schools across the city that day for the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr. This was seen as a lack of respect for King by the students.[1]\nMayor Ilus W. Davis decided to go to the marchers, meeting with them at Parade Park. After Davis joined several leaders from the Black community in talking with the marchers, he then joined the others to lead the march the remaining distance to City Hall. The crowd grew in size, slowly becoming more militant, more so when they arrived at City Hall to find a large contingent of Kansas City Police Department officers. As tensions rose, with verbal and physical actions escalating on both sides, a volley of tear gas by the KCPD into the crowd would be the final moment when the full riot was unavoidable. The students dispersed, but word of this spread through the city, and a riot erupted.[1][2]\nThe riot resulted in nearly 300 arrests, six deaths, and at least twenty hospital admissions.[3]\n",

From 1976-1988 none were executed, and from 1989-2021 91 persons were executed.[1]\nFrom 1937 until 1987 lethal gas inhalation was used. By 1987, inmates could choose lethal injection as opposed to lethal gas.[1]\nWhen the prosecution seeks the death penalty, the sentence is decided by the jury and must be unanimous. In case of a hung jury during the penalty phase of the trial, the judge decides the sentence.[2] The power of clemency belongs to the Governor of Missouri after receiving a non-binding advice from the Board of Probation and Parole.[3]\nExecutions are carried out by lethal injection or gas inhalation.[4]\nFirst-degree murder is punishable by death when it involves one of the 17 following aggravating factors:[5]\nMissouri law also provides the death penalty for treason, and placing a bomb near a bus terminal. Statute books also provide it for aggravating kidnapping, but capital punishment for this crime is no longer constitutional since the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court case Kennedy v. Louisiana.[6]\nMale death row offenders are housed at Potosi Correctional Center (PCC), while Women's Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center (WERDCC) has the female death row. Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center (ERDCC) houses the state's execution chamber.[1]\nThe first person executed in the modern era was George Mercer who was executed at the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City, Missouri on January 6, 1989.[7]  The next 61 executions starting with Gerald Smith were done at the Potosi Correctional Center in Potosi, Missouri.  Since April 2005, executions have been 25 miles east of Potosi at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri.

        "paragraph": "\nThe lynching of Jay Lynch, age 28, took place in Lamar, Missouri, on May 28, 1919. The year 1919 saw 83 lynchings in the United States. Lynch was one of only four white men lynched in that year.[1]\nJay Lynch had a long arrest record. Crimes he was accused of included burglary and robbery. In Oklahoma City he allegedly stole a car, and in Kansas City he allegedly stole $300 ($4,700 in 2023) worth of women's silks.[2] For almost a decade he was in and out of jail and escaped from prison several times. In 1918, he was hired on as a private detective of the Wabash Railroad in St. Louis. While working for the railway he was arrested for robbing a train.[3] Lynch skipped bail on that charge and was later arrested near his sister's house near Lamar.[2]\nOn March 3, 1919, while being held in Lamar in connection with the Wabash Railroad boxcar robbery in St. Louis, Lynch asked to use the jailhouse telephone. When Sheriff John Marion Harlow Jr. of Barton County opened his cell, Lynch fatally shot the sheriff with a gun he had earlier smuggled into the county jail. Harlow's son, Dick Harlow[A 1], heard the commotion and ran to save his father, but was also mortally wounded by Lynch and died a few days later.[4] After shooting the sheriff and his son, Lynch fled the state and drove across the country. He was denied entry to Mexico and was arrested again in La Junta, Colorado, on May 13, 1919, and sent back to Missouri.[5]\nLynch pleaded guilty to murder. As there was no death penalty in Missouri, he was sentenced to life in prison.[4][6]\nFearing violence from the packed courthouse, presiding judge B. G. Thurman had the prisoner taken into his private office after the verdict to say goodbye to Lynch's family. In his office were the judge; Lynch's wife, baby, mother, and sister; and several deputies assigned to guard the prisoner. While Lynch was holding his child, 24 people burst into the office and overpowered the armed guards. The men put a noose around Lynch's neck and dragged him out of the courthouse. The noose's rope was thrown over a tree branch, but when he was strung up, it broke under the weight. Another, sturdier branch was chosen, and Lynch was hanged in front of a cheering crowd.[7]\nThe coroner's report listed the cause of Lynch's death as \"at the hands of parties unknown\". Prosecuting attorney H. W. Timmonds and sheriff W. A. Sewell of Barton County started an investigation into the lynching, but no charges were ever filed as no one was willing to identify the perpetrators.[8]\nThe State of Missouri had abolished capital punishment in 1917.[9] In large part due to the events surrounding Lynch's lynching, as well as the representative of Barton County, H. C. Chancellor, giving an impassioned speech calling for the death penalty; the punishment was quickly restored for seven crimes: treason, perjury, subornation of perjury, first-degree murder, rape, kidnapping, and train robbery.[10] It was signed into law by Governor Frederick D. Gardner.[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "Frank Nash (February 6, 1887 \u2013 June 17, 1933)[1] was an American bank robber, and has been called \"the most successful bank robber in U.S. history.\" He is most noted for his violent death in the Kansas City Massacre. Nash spent part of his childhood in Paragould, Arkansas (Greene County) and was arrested in Hot Springs, Arkansas (Garland County) the day before his death.\nFrank \"Jelly\" Nash was born on February 6, 1887, in Birdseye, Indiana. His father, John \"Pappy\" Nash, started hotels in several southern towns, including Paragould and Jonesboro (Craighead County) Arkansas, and Hobart, Oklahoma. Nash's mother, Alta, was the second of John's three wives. Nash had two sisters and two stepbrothers. Living in Paragould from 1893 to 1896, he then moved with his father to Jonesboro and, afterward, to Hobart, which he later treated as his hometown.\nNash worked in his father's hotels and also served in the U.S. Army from 1904 to 1907. He later served three prison sentences for various crimes, including robbery and murder. Nash is thought to have participated in roughly 200 bank robberies and was often considered the \"mastermind\" of several groups of criminals. He planned various escapes from prison, both from within the prison and while free. In spite of his criminal record, Nash was widely considered friendly, likeable, and charming. His nickname, \"Jelly\" (shortened from \"Jellybean\"), began during his childhood, due to his poise and his well-groomed appearance (although some associate the nickname with the explosives used to open bank safes).\nNash was first convicted in 1913.[2] He and a friend, Nollie \"Humpy\" Wortman, stole nearly $1,000 from a store in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. While escaping, Nash suggested they hide the evidence. As Wortman went to bury the money, Nash shot him in the back. He was arrested hours later and sentenced to life in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. On March 28, 1918, Nash's sentence was reduced to ten years after he convinced the warden he wanted to join the army and fight in World War I. Nash signed his military registration card on June 12, 1918, and was released on August 16, 1918. Nash saw action in Belleau Wood, France, before the end of the war.  (The fighting in Belleau Wood ended in June, 1918, and the war ended November 11 of that year).\nTwo years later, Nash was convicted of burglary using explosives, also known as safe-cracking, and sentenced to twenty-five years in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. He became a trustee, and his sentence was reduced to five years. On December 29, 1922, Nash was released, and he joined the Al Spencer gang, a group of bank robbers.\nOn August 20, 1923, the Spencer gang robbed the Katy Limited postal train at Okesa, Oklahoma. Nash fled to Juarez, Mexico, where he married a local woman. Many sources claim that Nash hoped to falsify the date on the marriage license to provide him an alibi for the time of the train robbery. The same sources also state that Nash was already married to a sweetheart from Hobart, but the names of his first two wives are not known. His military registration card indicates that he was single in 1918.\nNash was enticed across the Mexico\u2013United States border and arrested for the burglary of the Katy Limited in early 1924. On March 1, Nash and three members of the Spencer gang received twenty-five-year sentences at the federal penitentiary at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, for mail robbery and assault on a mail custodian. In 1930, Nash was appointed the deputy warden's chef and general handyman, a position that brought privileges. On October 19, 1930, Nash was sent outside the prison on an errand and never returned.\nNash escaped to Chicago, Illinois,[3] where he fell in love with a barmaid named Frances Luce and continued his criminal activities, now in the major cities of the United States. Among other crimes during these years, Nash assisted in the escape of seven prisoners from Fort Leavenworth in December 1931.\nNash visited Hot Springs with Frances Luce and her daughter in the spring of 1932 and returned with them the following spring. Hot Springs was then known as a playground for members of the criminal underworld. Without telling her about his first two wives, Nash married Luce on May 26, 1933. The two adopted the last name of Moore.\n",

He also played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Chiefs and the Washington Redskins.\nIn 1980, Tyrer murdered his wife, and then committed suicide.\nBorn and raised in Newark, Ohio, Tyrer played college football at nearby Ohio State University under head coach Woody Hayes, and earned All-America honors.\nTyrer signed with the American Football League's Dallas Texans in 1961. He played 13 years with that franchise (180 consecutive games), which became the Kansas City Chiefs in 1963, helping set the standard for his position at left offensive tackle. His 14th and final season was with the Washington Redskins under head coach George Allen, who preferred veteran players. Tyrer was traded from the Chiefs in late August 1974 for three draft picks.[1]\nTyrer was named AFL Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1969. He and Ed Budde at guard made a powerful left side. In Super Bowl IV, Tyrer and Budde opened holes for Chiefs running backs against the Minnesota Vikings' opposing defensive linemen Jim Marshall and Alan Page, respectively, gaining 151 yards on 42 carries (3.6 yards per attempt) and 122 net passing yards in the team's upset 23\u20137 victory.\nTyrer was an anchor of Texans/Chiefs' line and was selected as The Sporting News'' AFL All-League tackle eight consecutive years, from 1962 through 1969. He was an AFL Western Division All-Star seven times, in 1962, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1969 before also capturing a pair of All-AFC accolades in 1970\u201371. His efforts in the upstart league would result in his selection to the American Football League All-Time Team.\nAt the retirement press conference for former Chief linemate Dave Hill in Kansas City in June 1975, Tyrer also announced his retirement.[2]\nTyrer's sons, Brad and Jason, went on to college football careers in the Big Eight Conference. Brad played for Nebraska under head coach Tom Osborne from 1983\u20131988, starting his junior and senior seasons. Tyrer and the Blackshirts defense led Nebraska to a win over LSU in the 1987 Sugar Bowl, a close loss to Florida State in the 1988 Fiesta Bowl, and a Big Eight title in 1988 and an appearance in the 1989 Orange Bowl. Jason was a defensive end for Kansas under head coach Glen Mason from 1988 to 1992.\n",

He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Missouri.[2]\nBeishline had a relatively normal childhood. Although he enjoyed playing pranks, he was not mean and even saved a drowning camper when he was 13 years old. According to his parents, Beishline had a promising future, although he was diagnosed as hyperactive at the age of seven. Due to this diagnosis, the young Beishline took ritalin for a period of three years, even though his parents weren't comfortable about their child using the drug.[3]\nWhen Beishline was twelve, he was suspended from school because the director caught him smoking marijuana. His parents consulted a psychologist and forced him to undergo therapy.\nIn high school Beishline distinguished himself and received honors with his average A\u2212 score, in addition to excelling in the wrestling and football teams. He was even named for a prize when he was 17 years old. However, that same year he was arrested for driving under the influence and was readmitted to the program.\nAt the age of 18 Beishline entered Purdue University and joined a fraternity. The following year he was sent back for cocaine use. He was also sentenced to 30 days in jail in Lafayette, Indiana for stealing a friend's camera, to get enough money for on his addiction. His parents then sent him to live with his grandparents in California, where he \"set out on the right path\". He completed the rehabilitation program, got a job and a girlfriend. But at a party he used cocaine again, and once more less than a month later.\nBeishline began by smoking marijuana, then, among other things, speed and valium. His favourite drug quickly became cocaine.\nBeishline was charged with first degree murder, elder abuse and robbery.\nOn January 7, 1993, Beishline called on 84-year old Evelyn Hoech, telling her that he was an insurance agent. When she refused to buy anything, he changed his story. Hoech later said that he had told her that the CIA had sent him to kill his insurance agent. He told her that he needed money to leave the city. When she refused he pointed a gun at her; she told him that if he wanted to kill her, he'd do it and leave the house. Then that Beishline dipped a cloth in liquid, pushed her to the ground and covered her mouth with it. The old lady passed out and when she came to he was gone. Beishline later pled guilty to the charges laid by Hoech.\nOn January 8, 1993, 72-year old Elisabeth Norton wasn't as lucky. According to the prosecutor Kevin Crane, Beishline entered Norton's home, and tried to sell her insurance. As the old lady wasn't fooled, he hit her, submerged her in chloroform, and threw her body in the Missouri River. In his defence, Missouri's state director of the public defense system, Daniel Gralike, said that his client had not intention of murder and that the 16 years of drug abuse had reduced his mental capabilities. Although he attacked Hoech and Norton with the purpose of stealing from them to finance his addiction, it was not, according to him, a case of murder in the first degree. When he sat on Norton's chest to drug her with chloroform - as he had done with Hoech - Beishline broke his sternum. Despite his speech, the jury accused Beishline of murder in the first degree.\n",

Her defense team led by John Jameson argued an affirmative defense: Celia killed Robert Newsom by accident in self defense to stop Newsom from raping her, which was a controversial argument at the time.[2] Celia was ultimately executed by hanging following a denied appeal in December 1855.[3] Celia's memory was revitalized by civil rights activist Margaret Bush Wilson who commissioned a portrait of Celia from Solomon Thurman.[4]\nNot much is known of Celia's origins or early childhood. Robert Newsom, a yeoman farmer, acquired approximately 14 year old Celia in Audrain County in 1850 to act as his concubine after his wife had died the previous year.[1] However, this purpose may have been masqueraded as acquiring a domestic servant for his daughter Virginia Waynescott or as a same-aged companion for his youngest child Mary Newsom.[5] On the way back to Callaway County, Newsom sexually assaulted Celia for the first time.[6]\nNewsom housed Celia separately from his other five slaves, all male, in a cabin close to the main house.[7] Celia became involved with George, one of Newsom's four adult male slaves, and began sharing this cabin with him by the beginning of 1855.[8]\nCelia had three children, at least one of which was indisputably Robert Newsom's.[9] Sometime during Celia's incarceration, Celia delivered her third child. Earlier historians reported that this child was stillborn.[10] More recent scholarship posits this child was sold following birth and is from whom Celia's living descendants are descended.[11] Following her execution, Harry Newsom, one of Robert Newsom's adult sons, may have acquired one of her daughters, because a female enslaved child appears in his household in the 1860 census.[10] According to the probate court of Callaway County, Celia's daughters were sold in the year following her execution.[11]\nIt is unknown where Celia's remains are interred.[12]\nIn early 1855, Celia, approximately nineteen, conceived for the third time, and the father of the child was uncertain.[9] At this time, George demanded Celia cut off her relationship with Robert Newsom.[9][13] Celia repeatedly requested, demanded, and threatened Newsom to stop sexually coercing her.[14][15][16]  On June 23, 1855, when Newsom came to her cabin that night, Celia struck Newsom twice with a large stick, killing him with the second blow.[14][17][18] She burned his body in her fireplace while her two children slept through the confrontation.[14][18] The following day, the search party consisting of the Newsom household and William Powell, a neighboring farmer, questioned first George and then Celia, who after sustained questioning, eventually confessed.[19]  Celia repeatedly denied George's involvement in the planning or execution of the murder, as well as the disposal of the body.[20]  After Celia's arrest, George was sold to another family.[11]\nState of Missouri vs. Celia, a Slave ran from June 25 to October 10, 1855. Celia's testimony does not appear in the trial records because at that time in Missouri, slaves were not allowed to testify in their own defense if their word disputed a white person's.[21]\nIt is a crime \"to take any woman unlawfully against her will and by force, menace or duress, compel her to be defiled.\"\nMissouri statute of 1845, article 2, section 29[22]\n",

Following his murder by a mob, he became a martyr to the abolitionist cause opposing slavery in the United States.[1] He was also hailed as a defender of free speech and freedom of the press.[1][2][3]\nLovejoy was born in New England and graduated from what is today Colby College.  Unsatisfied with a teaching career, he was drawn to journalism and decided to 'go west'.  In 1827, he reached St. Louis, Missouri.  Due to the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Missouri had entered the United States as a slave state.  Lovejoy edited a newspaper but returned east for a time to study for the ministry at Princeton University.  On his return to St. Louis, he founded the St. Louis Observer, in which he became increasingly more critical of slavery and the powerful interests protecting slavery.  Facing threats and violent attacks, Lovejoy decided to move across the river to Alton in Illinois, a free state. But Alton was also tied to the Mississippi River economy, easily reachable by anti-Lovejoy Missourians, and was badly split over pro-abolitionist and anti-abolitionist views.\nIn Alton, Lovejoy was fatally shot during an attack by a pro-slavery mob. The mob was seeking to destroy a warehouse owned by Winthrop Sargent Gilman and Benjamin Godfrey, which held Lovejoy's printing press and abolitionist materials.[4] According to John Quincy Adams, the murder \"[gave] a shock as of an earthquake throughout this country.\"[5] The Boston Recorder wrote that \"these events called forth from every part of the land 'a burst of indignation which has not had its parallel in this country since the Battle of Lexington.'\"[6] When informed about the murder, John Brown said publicly: \"Here, before God, in the presence of these witnesses, from this time, I consecrate my life to the destruction of slavery.\"[7]  Lovejoy is often seen as a martyr to the abolitionist cause and to a free press. The Lovejoy Monument was erected in Alton in 1897.\nElijah Parish Lovejoy was born at his paternal grandparents' frontier farmhouse near Albion, Maine (at that time, part of Massachusetts), the eldest of nine children of Elizabeth (Pattee) Lovejoy and Daniel Lovejoy.[8] Lovejoy's father was a Congregational preacher and farmer, and his mother was a homemaker and a devout Christian. Daniel Lovejoy named his son in honor of his close friend and mentor, Elijah Parish, a minister who was also involved in politics.[9] Due to his own lack of education, the father encouraged his sons \u2013 Elijah, Daniel, Joseph Cammett, Owen, and John \u2013 to become educated. Elijah was taught to read the Bible and other religious texts by his mother at an early age.[10][11]\nAfter completing early studies in public schools, Lovejoy attended the private Academy at Monmouth and China Academy. When sufficiently proficient in Latin and mathematics, he enrolled at Waterville College (now Colby College) as a sophomore in 1823.[10] Lovejoy received financial support from minister Benjamin Tappan to continue his studies there.[12] Based on faculty recommendations, from 1824 until his graduation in 1826, he also served as headmaster of Colby's associated high school, the Latin School (later known as the Coburn Classical Institute). In September 1826, Lovejoy graduated cum laude from Waterville,[13] and was class valedictorian.[14]\nDuring the winter and spring, he taught at China Academy in Maine. Dissatisfied with teaching, Lovejoy considered moving to the American South or westward to the Northwest Territory. His former teachers at Waterville College advised him that he would best serve God in the West (now considered the American Midwest).[15]\nIn May 1827, he went to Boston to earn money for his journey, having settled on the free state of Illinois as his destination.[16] Unsuccessful at finding work, he started for Illinois by foot. He stopped in New York City in mid-June to try to find work. He eventually landed a position with the Saturday Evening Gazette as a newspaper subscription peddler. For nearly five weeks, he worked to sell subscriptions.[17]\nStruggling with his finances, he wrote to Jeremiah Chaplin, president of Waterville College, explaining his situation. Chaplin sent the money that his former student needed.[17] Before embarking on his journey westward, Lovejoy wrote a poem which later seemed to prophesy his death:[18]\n",

It became the world's largest brewery in 1957 under direction of his son August A. \"Gussie\" Busch Jr.[1]\nAugust Anheuser Busch was born on December 29, 1865, in St. Louis, Missouri. His father, Adolphus Busch, was the German-born founder of Anheuser-Busch. His mother, Lilly Eberhard Anheuser, was the third daughter of brewer Eberhard Anheuser, who owned the Anheuser Brewery.[2] He had eight brothers and five sisters.[2]\nBusch became President of Anheuser-Busch in 1913, shortly after his father's death. Under his leadership, the company survived World War I, Prohibition, and the Great Depression by innovating and diversifying.\nThe company delved into the production of corn products, baker's yeast, ice cream, soft drinks, and commercial refrigeration units to stay afloat during Prohibition. After Prohibition ended in 1933, many of these operations were discontinued. August also managed to keep Anheuser-Busch prosperous during anti-German bias of World War I. He built the Bevo Mill, about halfway between his mansion on Gravois Road and the Anheuser-Busch brewery downtown.[3]\nBusch married Alice Ziesemann on May 8, 1890. Their children were Adolphus III, Marie, Clara, August Jr., and Alice Busch. The Busches were among prominent families who participated in the Veiled Prophet Ball, and in 1922, Alice Busch was selected as that year's Queen of Love and Beauty.[4]\nBoth sons joined the family business. Eldest son Adolphus became president and CEO of Anheuser-Busch. After his death in 1946, August Jr. became CEO, building the company into the largest brewery in the world.[1]\nIn his later life, Busch suffered from heart disease, dropsy, and gout. After being severely ill for several months, he committed suicide at the age of 68 with a gunshot to the abdomen on February 10, 1934, at the Busch Mansion at Grant's Farm.[5] Before shooting himself, August penned a brief note to his family saying, \"Goodbye precious mommie and adorable children.\"[3] The St. Louis County coroner's jury gathered at the Busch mansion and heard Busch's chauffeur testify to the events of August's suicide. A Dr. P.E. Rutledge of Kirkwood also testified that he had given Busch morphine seven hours before the suicide. The coroner's jury ruled August's death a suicide due to long illness.[3]\nThousands of people mourned August at the Busch mansion, including senators and brewers. Busch's lawyer, Daniel N. Kirby said during the service, \"As worthy son of a noble father, he was as great a leader in saving the industry as his father had been in creating it.\"[3] Although his parents are buried in a mausoleum at Bellefontaine Cemetery, August wished to be buried at Sunset Burial Park, near Grant's Farm in St. Louis. St. Louis police had to keep crowds away from August's grave.[3]\n",

It was constructed beginning in 1938 by Brother Bronislaus Luszcz, a Polish immigrant of the Franciscan order.\nIn 1927, John J. Glennon, Archbishop of St. Louis requested a group of Franciscans to come from Poland to set up a nursing home in the countryside. A number of Franciscan Missionary Brothers of the Sacred Heart of Jesus emigrated from Poland to the St. Louis area. Among them was Brother Bronislaus Luszcz, age thirty-four. They were given an abandoned convent in the foothills of the Ozarks, and built an infirmary. The brothers had a small farm that produced food for the infirmary and brothers.[1] The Black Madonna Shrine is adjacent to the site of the infirmary which closed in 2008. \nIn 1937, Brother Bronislaus began clearing the thickly wooded land, built a cedar wood chapel and hung a portrait of the Black Madonna of Cz\u0119stochowa above the altar. The image is referred as the Black Madonna because of its dark brown skin tones. The chapel soon became a center of religious devotion, with numerous pilgrimages, prayer services and masses being offered.[2] A picnic pavilion is on site.[3]\nThe Black Madonna Shrine was built out of his devotion to Mary, and dedicated to her as \"Queen of Peace and Mercy\".[4] After completing the chapel, Brother Bronislaus began building grottoes, using concrete and native Missouri tiff rock acquired from the nearby mining town of Potosi. The stone and rock structures are made to resemble natural cave formations. The grottos feature statues of Saint Francis, Saint Joseph, Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Jesus and the disciples at Gethsemane, Our Lady of Sorrows, Mary's Assumption, and the Nativity. Each is an intricate mosaic with seashells, costume jewelry, ceramic figurines, and colorful bits brought to him by pilgrims from time to time. Cake pans shaped like lambs and rabbits became molds for the concrete animals that sit at the feet of St. Francis. The altar stone at the Our Lady of Sorrows Grotto is from the original monastery chapel. The Crucifix of the Gethsemane Grotto is used as landmark by local hikers making their way through the nearby woods.[5]\nBrother Bronislaus spent twenty three years building the shrine, and died from heat stroke in 1960 at the age of sixty-six, while working on a grotto of Our Lady of Fatima.[1]\nThe shrine has been subjected to arson and vandalism many times in its history. In 1958 an arsonist set fire to the altar which burned the chapel. An open-air chapel was built in the early 1960s to replace the burned chapel. Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski, Primate of Poland, donated a painting to replace one lost in the fire. John Carberry, Cardinal Archbishop of St. Louis donated a glass-encased icon of Our Lady of Czestochowa from the former Church of Our Lady of Czestochowa in St. Louis.[5]\nIn 2013, a thief broke into shrine gift shop and stole some sterling silver medals, silver plated necklaces, and a donation jar containing change.[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "The shooting of Antonio Martin occurred on December 23, 2014, in Berkeley, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Martin, an 18-year-old black male, was fatally shot by a white Berkeley police officer when Martin pulled a gun on him. The shooting sparked protests in the St. Louis area and other cities in the U.S. The shooting elicited comparison to the earlier shooting death of Michael Brown two miles away in Ferguson, Missouri.\nOn the night of December 23, 2014, a Berkeley Police Department officer responded to an employee's emergency phone call report at 11:11\u00a0pm of shoplifting by two men at a Mobil On the Run convenience store along the 6800 block of North Hanley Road.[1][2] An unidentified officer arrived at 11:15\u00a0p.m. in his police cruiser and saw two men just outside the store who matched the description of the suspects.[1]\nThe shooting happened in a parking lot outside a Mobil gas station. The police officer was not wearing a body camera and there were no shots fired by the teen's gun.[3] As the officer fired, he fell to the ground while running away, which was caught on video by the store's security cameras.[1][4] One of the shots fired by the officer struck Martin, another struck the tire of the officer's vehicle, and the third is unaccounted for.[4]\nPolice recovered a Hi-Point 9mm handgun from the scene, said to be Martin's, with five rounds in the magazine and one round in the chamber.[5][6]\nFootage of the incident was captured by surveillance cameras outside the convenience store.[1] According to police, several witness' accounts back up the officer's story that Martin was first to draw his weapon.[2] The officer said he was not wearing the body camera he had been issued earlier that day. The police car's dash-camera was likely not recording at the time.[6]\nThe officer is identified as a 34-year-old white male, and a six-year veteran of the department.[4] He had previously Served with the Country Club Hills, Missouri Police Department.[1] He is represented by attorney Brian Millikan who also represents St. Louis police officer Jason Flanery in the October killing of VonDeritt Myers.[4]\nSt. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch assigned a prosecutor to the county's investigation. The City of Berkeley will conduct its own independent investigation.[1]\nDespite complaints about the timeliness of medical attention to arrive, paramedics arrived six minutes after the shooting. Martin was declared dead, and his body covered, by 11:28\u00a0p.m.[2] A crowd of onlookers and protesters gathered at the scene within 20 minutes of the shooting.[1][2] The county crimes against persons unit arrived at 12:15\u00a0a.m.[6] As the crowd grew angry, protesters clashed with law enforcement working to protect the scene for investigators collecting evidence. The crowd grew to an estimated 300 people as tensions escalated. Some threw rocks and other projectiles at them.[1]\nMedia crews and surveillance video recorded an individual lighting fires with lighter fluid inside and outside the same store when looters broke in. Police say 19-year-old Joshua Williams of St. Louis was the individual. Williams, a frequently quoted advocate for peace in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting, was charged days later with arson in the first degree, a felony; felony burglary and misdemeanor stealing. On video Williams confessed to police of lighting the fires.[7] Four others were arrested for assault-related offenses. Martin's body was removed from the crime scene at around 1:40\u00a0a.m. Several protesters lingered at the site throughout the night.[1]\n",

By his teens, Willie had followed his older brother Thomas into the Kinney Gang. By the time Tom took over the street gang in 1904, nineteen-year-old Willie was one of his best men. The Rats, at this point in time, specialized in political terrorism, armed robbery, extortion, and bootlegging. With the murder of Egan gangster Sam Young on April 4, 1909, Willie Egan inherited his saloon at the corner of Fourteenth and Franklin streets, which would remain a gang headquarters for over ten years.\nGenerally quiet and reserved, Willie was nonetheless a tough street fighter who proved himself time and time again in action. However, Willie wasn't as passionate and gregarious as his older brother Tom was. When original Egan's Rat William \"Skippy\" Rohan was gunned down in Tom's saloon on January 8, 1916, Tom Egan made plans to kill the shooter, Rat gangster Harry \"Cherries\" Dunn. Willie successfully argued from Dunn's life, only to have \"Cherries\" go berserk later that year, killing Egan allies for trivial reasons. Willie tracked his former pal to the Typo Press Club on the night of September 19, 1916 and watched as two of his men shot and killed Dunn. This touched off a gang war with the remnant of the old Bottoms Gang, a longtime rival of the Egan's Rats. The Egans would ultimately prevail, eliminating the Bottoms Gang once and for all.\nUpon Tom Egan's 1919 death, Willie took control of the Egan mob. He served as a constable under Judge Andy Gazzolo and a member of the Democratic City Committee. His right-hand man, William \"Dint\" Colbeck, served as his sergeant-at-arms. While Willie tried to maintain the gang's bootlegging rackets, the younger members, known as \"red hots\", began looking to high-risk robberies as a source of income.\nWillie Egan split with his long-time friend, Max Greenberg, when Maxie chiseled Egan out of a whiskey shipment. While the two conversed on a downtown street corner on March 11, 1921, a gunman appeared out of nowhere and began shooting. Greenberg was shot through the face and another man, John Sweeney, was killed. Willie Egan himself was shot in the arm. It was widely believed that Willie engineered the attempt of Maxie's life. After recovering and boasting connections to New York bootlegger Arnold Rothstein, Max Greenberg signed on with the Hogan Gang.\nWhile standing out in front of his Franklin Avenue saloon on Halloween night, 1921, Willie Egan was fatally shot by gunmen in a passing automobile. It was said he gasped the names of his killers to Dint Colbeck, who rushed to his aid just after the shooting. Colbeck announced to his men that the shooters were James Hogan, John Doyle, and Luke Kennedy. The ensuing gang war rocked St. Louis and claimed well over a dozen lives (including those of Doyle and Kennedy).\n",

The population was 1,292 at the 2010 census. In 2010, the town annexed property along Route 97 into Barry County to a point just north of U.S. Route 60. It was estimated to be 1,309 by the City of Pierce City as of July 1, 2019.[4]\nThere was once a small village called St. Martha about two and a half miles west of Pierce City.  It was surveyed for William Robert Wild on Section 30, Pierce Township, May 9, 1870.  Wild committed suicide there on June 8, 1870.[5]  Nothing remains of the village.[6]\nPierce City was laid out in 1870[7] as a stop on the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. It was originally spelled Peirce City, named for Andrew Peirce, Jr. of Boston, president of the St. Louis\u2013San Francisco Railway.[8][nb 1] The Pierce spelling was used erroneously by the United States Postal Service and adopted officially in the 1930s.[8][10] A 1982 attempt to revert to Peirce was rejected by the United States Census Bureau.[10]\nOn August 19, 1901 a large white mob took three African-American men from jail in Pierce City and lynched them. French and William Godley, and Peter Hampton[11] were suspects in the murder of a young white woman. Two of the men were quite aged and were unlikely suspects; none had a chance at a trial. These are the only recorded lynchings in Lawrence County.[12]\nUnrest continued, and the white mob burned five black homes, and drove \"30 families into the woods\", affecting the roughly 300 black residents in the town. (It had about 1,000 white residents.) Most of the African Americans lost all their land and property; whites simply took over the empty properties.\nThis was part of a pattern of violence in southwest Missouri in the early 20th century; there were also large public lynchings in Joplin and Springfield, resulting in many African Americans abandoning the region for less hostile territory. \"Monett, Peirce City, Rogers, Ark., and several other towns around here have driven the negros out.\"[13] By 1910 only 91 African Americans remained in Lawrence County and their numbers continued to decline.[14] The incident has been considered an act of ethnic cleansing.[15]\nIn reaction, Mark Twain wrote the essay The United States of Lyncherdom, which was published posthumously.[16]\nIn the 21st century, some descendants of the people who had been driven out of Pierce City threatened to file a lawsuit for the city's failure to protect their families and to recover the value of their families' properties, but none has been filed. There have been other grassroots efforts to acknowledge these crimes and injustices.\nThe Lawrence County Bank Building and Pierce City Fire Station, Courthouse and Jail are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[17]\n",

Attempts by the FBI's Cryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit (CRRU) and the American Cryptogram Association failed to decipher the meanings of those two coded notes, which are listed as one of the CRRU's top unsolved cases.[1] On March 29, 2011, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an appeal for help from the public in obtaining the meaning of the messages. A few days later, they updated their website to note the \"outpouring of responses\", and established a separate page[2] where the public can offer comments and theories.[3][4]\nRicky McCormick was a high school dropout who had held multiple addresses in the Greater St. Louis area,[5] living intermittently with his elderly mother.[6] According to a 1999 article in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, McCormick suffered from chronic heart and lung problems. He was not married, but had fathered at least four children. He had a criminal record, and had previously served 11 months of a three-year sentence for statutory rape. At the time of his death, he was 41 years old, unemployed, and receiving disability welfare payments.[7]\nMcCormick's body was found on June 30, 1999, in a cornfield near West Alton, Missouri by a woman driving along a field road near Route 367.[6][5] The reason he was 15 miles (24\u00a0km) away from his then-current address is another mystery, as he did not own a car and the area was not served by public transportation.[8] Though the body had already somewhat decomposed, authorities used fingerprints to identify McCormick. There was no indication that anyone had a motive to kill McCormick and no one had reported him missing. As such, the authorities initially ruled out homicide; however, no cause of death was officially determined at the time. McCormick was last seen alive five days earlier, on June 25, 1999, getting a checkup at St. Louis' now-defunct Forest Park Hospital.[6]\nThe two notes found in McCormick's pockets are written in an unknown code consisting of \"a jumble of letters and numbers occasionally set off with parentheses\" and are believed by the FBI to possibly lead to those responsible for the killing. Dan Olson, chief of the FBI's Cryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit, said, illustrating the significance of the notes, \"Breaking the code could reveal the victim's whereabouts before his death and could lead to the solution of a homicide.\"[3][6] \nAttempts by both the FBI's Cryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit (CRRU) and the American Cryptogram Association failed to decipher their meaning, and Ricky McCormick's encrypted notes are currently listed as one of CRRU's top unsolved cases, with McCormick's killer yet to be identified.[1] According to members of McCormick's family, Ricky had not used encrypted notes as a boy, and apparently no one in his family knows how to decipher the codes, either.[3]\nThe FBI has had so many responses with suggestions for the cipher that they later requested helpers to not call by phone nor use email.[9] An FBI news release has stated, \"This story has generated an outpouring of responses. \nTo accommodate the continuing interest in this case, we have established a page[10] where the public can offer their comments and theories about the coded messages.\"[11]\nIn a 2012 interview with the Riverfront Times, McCormick's family members said \"they never knew of Ricky to write in code. They say they only told investigators he sometimes jotted down nonsense he called writing, and they seriously question McCormick's capacity to craft the notes found in his pockets.\"[12] His mother, Frankie Sparks, said \"The only thing he could write was his name. He didn't write in no code.\"[12] His cousin, Charles McCormick, said Ricky \"couldn't spell anything, just scribble.\"[12]\nMoreover, when McCormick died, officials told his family about the other contents of the victim's pockets, but the family only found out about the notes twelve years later when informed by a local news broadcast.[12]\n",

Johnson's execution by lethal injection proved controversial, as a 2008 surgery had removed up to 20 percent of his brain tissue, leaving Johnson permanently cognitively disabled.\nJohnson was born on August 20, 1960,[1] in Steele, Missouri, and was raised by his grandmother in Charleston. His mother had substance abuse problems, including alcohol addiction, and Johnson had fetal alcohol spectrum disorder as a result.[2] As an adult, Johnson was arrested and imprisoned for robbery and burglary, but he was released on parole in May 1993.[3] Johnson also suffered from substance abuse in his adult life, and in January 1994, he asked his parole officer for assistance with alcohol addiction.[4][5]\nOn February 12, 1994, Johnson killed three convenience store employees during an attempted robbery of a local Casey's in Columbia, Missouri: Mary Bratcher (46), Mable Scruggs (57), and Fred Jones (58).[6] Johnson, who had been under the influence of cocaine at the time, had borrowed a .25-caliber pistol with the intention of robbing the store. When Bratcher attempted to destroy a key to the Casey's safe during the attempted robbery, Johnson became angry with his victims. He shot them with the borrowed gun before beating them to death with a claw hammer. Bratcher was also stabbed in the head with a screwdriver.[7] Johnson then stored the bodies in the store's bathroom and cooler before fleeing the scene, disposing of most of his belongings in a nearby field.[8] Bratcher and Scruggs were both mothers.[9]\nJohnson went to trial on May 11, 1995, in the Boone County Circuit Court. Prosecutor Kevin Crane told reporters that he would seek the death penalty for Johnson in connection to the murders.[10] After a week of trial, the jury deliberated for two hours before reaching a verdict. On May 19, Johnson was convicted on three counts of first degree murder, with a recommendation that he be sentenced to death.[11]\nIn 2008, Johnson underwent brain surgery to remove a tumor. The surgery was an incomplete success, with some tumor mass remaining, as well as scar tissue from the procedure, which led to Johnson developing epileptic seizures.[12] Johnson feared that execution by lethal injection would result in painful seizures, and he requested that he be executed by firing squad instead.[13] The request was denied, as the state of Missouri does not authorize use of a firing squad.[8] It is estimated that the 2008 surgical procedure caused Johnson to lose up to 20 percent of his brain tissue; even before the surgery, however, his IQ scores ranged from 67 to 77, falling within the threshold of intellectual disability.[14]\nWith Johnson's execution approaching, his attorney, public defender Jeremy Weis, attempted to argue before the Missouri Supreme Court that Johnson's intellectual disability meant that execution would serve as a violation of the Eighth Amendment. On August 31, 2021, the Supreme Court rejected both Weis's claim of intellectual disability as well as his additional claim that execution by lethal injection would cause a painful seizure.[15] As Johnson's case received more widespread media attention, a number of political and religious leaders petitioned Governor Mike Parson, in the days leading up to Johnson's death, to grant clemency. Among these petitioners were Rep. Cori Bush, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, and Pope Francis.[8] A number of anti-capital punishment activists also protested the execution outside of the Boone County Courthouse, petitioning Parson to halt the execution. Activists clarified that they were not asking the governor to release Johnson from prison, but that they were rather asking for a change in sentencing to life in prison.[16]\nOn October 4, Parson released a statement saying that he would not grant clemency to Johnson, and that the execution would proceed as planned.[17] Johnson died by lethal injection at 6:11\u00a0p.m. on Tuesday, October 5, 2021, at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center prison in Bonne Terre, Missouri.[18] He read a written last statement aloud, apologizing for his actions, reiterating his love for his friends and family, and thanking those who had prayed on his behalf. As the injection began, he mouthed unknown words to his relatives. Johnson was formally pronounced dead nine minutes after receiving an injection of pentobarbital.[8]\nJohnson's last meal consisted of two double bacon cheeseburgers, onion rings, two large strawberry milkshakes and a large pizza.[19]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Package Killer is the name attributed to an American serial killer who murdered between three and five women in the St. Louis area from 1990 to 1991.[1] His pseudonym comes from the receptacles the victims were sometimes found in.[2]\nOn September 19, 2022, convicted killer Gary Muehlberg was charged with the murders.[3][4][5]\nOn March 26, 1990, the body of 19-year-old Robyn J. Mihan was discovered alongside a Highway stuffed between two mattresses in Silex, Missouri. She had been reported missing four days prior on March 22.[2] An autopsy showed that she had been strangled, and her hands were bound together. She had worked as a prostitute.[1]\nOn June 11, 1990, the body of 40-year-old Donna Reitmeyer was found inside of a rubber trash bin near South Broadway. Her body was so badly decomposed that the cause of death remains unknown, but signs of violence were located.[1]\nOn October 4, the body of a woman was found inside of a plastic trash can along a roadside near Interstate 270 by a jogger who had noticed a foul odor. The woman remained unidentified for months, until police were able to confirm the woman was 27-year-old Brenda Jean Pruitt, whose family had reported her missing on May 9.[1]\nOn February 17, 1991, the body of a woman was found stuffed in a wooden box along the I-70. The victim was found to have been wearing a stocking cap, and authorities released the type of cap in hopes to identify the body.[6] She was identified as 21-year-old Sandy Little, who had been missing since September 4, 1990. She was found to have worked as a sex worker.[1]\nOn May 12, 1991, the body of 37-year-old Sandra Cain was found on the road along Interstate 44. An autopsy wasn't able to confirm the cause of death, but narrowed it down that she either had been hit by a car or thrown off the overpass. Cain had worked as a sex worker, and reportedly, victim Sandy Little had told Cain to not go with a man in a station wagon. It is speculated that the man is the killer.[1]\nThe three murders were connected, and they contributed to the murders to the work of a serial killer. The perpetrator was named The Package Killer due to the manner in which he disposed of the bodies.[2] The FBI joined the investigation in 1991.[1] Investigators first identified one man, a 34-year-old St. Louis resident, as a possible suspect. The man had been accused of torturing and raping several local prostitutes.[1] The man was questioned, but denied responsibility for the murders.[7]\nIn April 2022 investigators from the St. Charles County Police Crime Lab linked 73-year-old Gary Randall Muehlberg[8] to one of the murders.[9] The identification came from DNA evidence left at the crime scene, which had been entered through CODIS and matched with Muehlberg's prison sample.[9] That same month a detective named Jodi Weber visited Muehlberg at Potosi Correctional Center, where he was serving a life sentence for killing Kenneth Atchison in 1993.[9] During their communications, he admitted to killing Mihan, Pruitt, and Little. In mid-September 2022 prosecutors sent letters to Muehlberg promising they would not seek the death penalty.[5] He then confessed to killing Reitmeyer and a Jane Doe.[5][3][4] He has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder.[10]\n",

Its race and sex could not be determined at first, but it was later identified as Randall Wayne \"Randy\" Potter (February 13, 1963 \u2013 January 17, 2017), who had last been seen leaving his Lenexa, Kansas, home one morning the previous January. He had been reported missing after he failed to arrive at his job that day; his death was ruled a suicide.[1]\nPotter's family, who had been searching for him and his truck since his disappearance and keeping the media's attention on the case, were outraged that his body was found at the airport parking lot, an area authorities told them they had searched immediately after they reported him missing. His wife believes that he had purposely taken his life at the airport on the expectation his family would look for him there first. The Kansas City Aviation Department, which runs the airport, apologized to the Potters and promised to investigate how the contractor that manages its parking lots allowed the body to remain undiscovered for almost eight months.[2]\nLenexa police said that since they had not found any evidence that Potter had taken a flight from the airport, and no one had expressed any concern that he might be suicidally inclined, they did not investigate further at the airport as they assumed the authorities there were regularly checking for Potter's truck. The Kansas City Star found that there were other instances of apparently abandoned vehicles remaining in the airport lots for months in the face of apparent official indifference.[3] An editorial in the newspaper recalled a similar incident in 1994 where a woman had found the body of her husband, who had also taken his own life, in the trunk of his car, five days after police at the airport had found the car parked there and returned it to her.\nPotter, originally from Town 'n' Country, Florida,[4] had met his wife, Carolina, in her native Sicily while he was stationed there with the United States Navy. After marrying and starting a family in Sicily, they moved back to the U.S. in the 1990s. From Florida, the Potters had moved to Lenexa, Kansas, where Potter worked as a project engineer[1] at T-Mobile and hunted and fished in his spare time. Carolina was a flight attendant, working flights to the East Coast from Kansas City International Airport.[2]\nIn mid-January 2017, Potter took several days off work to stay at home with his son Matthew, who was sick. Matthew recalls that the two did nothing unusual, mostly staying at home and watching television; he did not see anything atypical in his father's behavior or demeanor. Randy planned to return to work on January 17, and as was his practice, laid out his work clothing the previous evening before retiring.[5]\nThe next morning, Potter awoke at his usual time. Matthew recalls hearing his father feed the family dogs outside. Around 7 a.m. he left for work[5] in his company-issued 2014 white Dodge Ram pickup truck.[1]\nA few hours later, the family received a call from T-Mobile, asking where Randy was as he had not come to work. Calls to his phone were not answered. Carolina Potter found that he had left his work clothes where he had hung them in the bathroom the night before, but his pajamas and the slippers he had put on after rising were still missing, suggesting he had left the house wearing them. She said this was unlike him. The family reported him missing to Lenexa police later that day.[5]\nThe family began organizing search parties on its own,[5] and set up a Facebook page.[1] Melissa Alderman, a niece of Potter's from Florida who flew up to assist them, suggested that he might have flown somewhere, so they went to the airport, approximately a 45-minute drive from Lenexa, and looked through the parking lots there. They gave airport police the license plate number of Randy's truck, and they were told it would be checked for regularly as the police recorded the plate number of every vehicle in the lots.[6]\n",

The Mormons were evicted from Jackson County in 1833 and resettled in new counties nearby, where tensions grew again and attempts to evict them resumed. On August 6, 1838, the war began following a brawl at an election in Gallatin, resulting in increased organized violence between Mormons and non-Mormons backed by the Missouri Volunteer Militia in northwestern Missouri. The Battle of Crooked River in late October led to Lilburn Boggs, the Governor of Missouri, issuing the Missouri Executive Order 44, ordering the Mormons to leave Missouri or be killed. On November 1, 1838, Smith surrendered at Far West, the church's headquarters, ending the war. Smith was charged for treason but escaped custody and fled to Illinois with the remainder of the estimated 10,000 Missouri Mormons, establishing the new settlement of Nauvoo.\nDuring the conflict, 22 people were killed (three Mormons and one non-Mormon at Battle of Crooked Creek,[1] one Mormon prisoner fatally injured while in custody,[2] and 17 Mormons at Haun\u2019s Mill[3]), and an unknown number of non-combatants died due to exposure and hardship as a result of being expelled from their homes in Missouri.[4] All of the conflicts in the Mormon War occurred in a corridor 100 miles (160\u00a0km) to the east and northeast of Kansas City.\nShortly after what Mormons consider to be the restoration of the gospel in 1830, Smith stated that he had received a revelation that the Second Coming of Christ was near, that the City of Zion would be near the town of Independence in Jackson County, Missouri, and that his followers were destined to inherit the land held by the current settlers.\n\nIf ye are faithful, ye shall assemble yourselves together to rejoice upon the land of Missouri, which is the land of your inheritance, which is now the land of your enemies.[5]",

He was a member of the James-Younger gang, participating in a number of robberies and other crimes. He was shot dead by Robert Ford during a gunfight with Ford's friend Dick Liddil. The death of Hite precipitated the series of events that culminated in the killing of Jesse James by Ford.\nWood Hite was born in 1850 in Logan, Kentucky, to Major George Burns and Nancy Gardner Hite (nee James).  His mother was the sister of Robert Sallee James, the father of Frank and Jesse James of the James-Younger Gang, making Wood a first cousin to the James brothers.  \nHite fought for the Confederacy in the American Civil War as a member of William T. Anderson's raiders.[1]\nAfter the disastrous Northfield Minnesota raid in 1876, James needed new gang members. Wood and his brother Clarence joined the gang.[1]\nHite was described as being between 5'8\" and 5'10\" with dark sandy hair, light complexion, a prominent Roman nose, and stooped shoulders that made him appear slouched. In his book The Life, Times and Treacherous Death of Jesse James, author Frank Triplett described him as \"a great admirer of himself, as well as of the opposite sex\".[2] Bill O'Neal describes him as a \"gangling, stoop-shouldered man with prominent, decaying front teeth.\" Easily recognized, he was quickly forced into hiding after he was identified following robberies by the gang.[1]\nIn 1881 Hite was arrested after shooting and killing John Tabor, a black man who had made Hite angry. Tabor was shot while sitting on a fence. Hite's stepmother, who witnessed the murder, gave sworn testimony against him. He escaped from jail after bribing one of his guards.[1]\nHite was shot to death on December 4, 1881, in Ray County, Missouri, by Dick Liddil and Robert Ford, also members of the James-Younger Gang. All three were staying at the house of Martha Bolton, Ford's widowed sister.[2] Hite and Liddil were both attracted to Martha, and clashed over their rivalry. The conflict culminated in an argument during which both drew their guns. Liddil and Hite shot at each other repeatedly. Liddil was hit once in the leg, and Hite was hit in the arm. During the battle, Ford drew his gun and shot Hite once in the head. He died about 15 minutes later. Ford and his brother Charley Ford buried Hite in an unmarked grave.[1](Hites remains were recovered In April 1882[3])\nIn January 1882, Robert Ford and Liddil surrendered to Sheriff James Timberlake for Hite's murder, on the condition that they would receive pardons and a reward.[4] Ford claimed that on January 12, 1882 he met with Missouri governor Thomas Crittenden who agreed to pardon Ford for the murder of Wood Hite if he would deliver Jesse James, dead or alive.[5] Robert Ford shot Jesse James shortly after James saw a news report of Liddil's confession to the killing of Hite. Ford claimed that he believed James would turn on him after learning of the murder. After the death of James, Ford stood trial for Hite's murder and was found not guilty by a jury.[6] In April 1901, Liddil was rearrested for the murder of Hite, but was later released, dying of heart failure three months later.[citation needed]\nIn the 2007 movie The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Hite was portrayed by Jeremy Renner.[7] His death is portrayed as the result of a gun battle between Hite and Liddil in a bedroom after Hite appears to have been attempting to take them by surprise. When Liddil runs out of bullets, Hite points his gun at his head at point-blank range, only to be shot from behind by Ford.\n",

He was arrested shortly after the final murder, and DNA evidence linked him to the previous crimes, after which he confessed and was given multiple life sentences.[1]\nDaniel O. Jones was born on September 26, 1969. A native of Kansas City, Jones attended Raytown South High School in Raytown, Missouri. As a student, he was known to be disruptive in class, was often seen wandering the hallway unattended, and was frequently in trouble.[2] On May 20, 1987, Jones attacked a female teacher, dragged her from her classroom into the school's auditorium where he raped her, and threatened to kill her. After about 15 minutes, the teacher was able to escape. He was arrested three days later when the victim identified him from the school yearbook. Jones pleaded innocent in his arraignment when he was indicted on one count of forcible rape.[3][4]\nIn 1988, Jones was found guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In 1989, he attempted to appeal his sentence on the grounds that prosecutors should not have been allowed to bring up Jones' behavior in school, however, the appeal was rejected.[2] In 1996, Jones was paroled after serving eight years of his sentence.[1][5]\nOn December 2, 1998, Jones broke into the apartment of 19-year-old Jenai Douglas, whom he had known since his adolescence. Jones attacked and stabbed Douglas repeatedly until her death.[1] After the killing, Jones left the apartment without stealing anything. Later that same day, Douglas' roommate returned home and found her body.[6] According to Douglas' mother Kim, Jones would stop by her house on multiple occasions to offer condolences after Jenai's murder.[1]\nOn March 10, 1999, Jones broke into apartment of 21-year-old Kaliquah Gilliam. Jones brandished a knife and attacked Gilliam, stabbing her a total of 36 times before stopping, presumably after realizing she was dead, and fleeing the area.[1] On August 16, 1999, Jones smashed the back patio window to enter the apartment of 21-year old Roxanne Colley. Jones had known Colley as the two had become acquainted with one another and had sex with each other, even though Colley had a boyfriend.[1] Once again, Jones brandished a knife and attacked Colley, raping her, then stabbing her repeatedly before slashing her throat, ultimately killing her.[1]\nIn February 2000, shortly after the first anniversary of Jenai Douglas' murder, a reward of $3,000 was offered for information leading to finding her killer. Kim Douglas had added an extra $2,000 to the standard $1,000 in hopes of a bigger chance in solving the case.[7] On March 6, 2001, Jones broke into an apartment at the Linden Hill apartment complex, owned by 18-year-old Candriea White, a young mother of two. Jones attacked her with a knife in the kitchen, stabbing and slashing her 14 times. After White was dead, Jones left the house, having not harmed her infant children who had watched the ordeal.[8]\nOn March 8, Jones was arrested based upon his palm print and fingerprints matching the ones the killer left behind at the house. While behind bars, a sample of his DNA was collected by investigators who matched the sample to semen evidence left behind at Roxanne Colley's murder.[9] Jones appointed Horton Lance to defend him during his trial. In his trial, Lance brought up that Jones had an alibi the day of the murder, as his family members testified that he was with them that afternoon. Lance also cast doubt on the fingerprinting evidence that was used to charge Jones, saying that the prosecutors lacked witnesses, a confession, and a motive.[10] On August 21, 2002, the jury found Jones guilty of White's murder, subsequently imposing the sentence of life imprisonment without parole.[1]\nWhen re-looking at older cases, investigators noted how similar the killings of Douglas and Gilliam were to Jones' modus operandi.[11] Jones' DNA was also taken and compared to the murders of Douglas and Gilliam, but the samples were not enough to identify him as the killer.[1] In 2004, Jones confessed to killing Douglas and Gilliam and offered to plead guilty to all charges. Gilliam's grandmother said that, while she was frustrated with Jones, she did not want him to be sentenced to death because, according to her, he was just a young man.[1]\n",

McCullough went to California during the 1849 Gold Rush and remained there for 5 years. On November 26, 1856, he married Eloise Randolph in Marion County. They became the parents of three children, including a son who went on to practice law in Edina, Missouri.\nAt the outbreak of the war, McCullough joined the Confederate forces under General Thomas Green. He took part in the Battle of Lexington, before being sent by General Sterling Price to recruit in northeastern Missouri with Joseph C. Porter in the spring of 1862.[1][2]\nDuring the guerrilla campaign in Northeast Missouri in the summer of 1862, McCullough sought unsuccessfully to persuade Colonel Porter to restrict himself to recruiting and not engage the Union forces. According to one of his men, Joseph Mudd (see references), this was because McCullough feared the retaliation Federal forces would inflict upon civilian Southern sympathizers. The observation may accurately reflect McCullough's character, which is universally praised, but it is colored by the author's Confederate perspective. Prior to the engagement at Kirksville, McCullough again urged Porter to decline battle and send his raw recruits to Arkansas for training and equipping behind Confederate lines. Porter refused and McCullough proposed that Porter at least wait in the cornfields outside of town, instead of fighting in the village itself. Again, his advice was ignored.\nAfter Porter's disastrous defeat at Kirksville, McCullough became ill. Declining Porter's offer of escort, he rode alone towards Edina to recover and continue recruiting. He was discovered by Federal troops and surrendered.[3]\nMcCullough requested to be sent to Palmyra, rather than to Kirksville, possibly because he had already heard of the executions of prisoners there, but the request was denied. Although he had been treated well in Edina, according to eyewitnesses he was paraded up and down the streets of Kirksville to jeering crowds. He was accused of lacking a military commission, of fighting on his own authority \u2014 that is, of being a bushwhacker\u2014 and of persuading parolees to return to Confederate service.\nA drumhead court-martial was convened on Friday, August 8, by Lt. Col. W.F. Schaffer of Merrill's Horse. McCullough stated that he had been elected second in command of the regiment of Colonel Cyrus Franklin, but had not yet received his commission. He had also previously held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Missouri State Guard, but that commission had long since expired. McCullough was found guilty and sentenced to be shot. The officer who read the death sentence did so with tears.\nMcCullough made two requests before his execution: that he be allowed to write a letter to his wife, and for permission to give the firing squad orders to fire.  Both were granted.  After being taken west of Kirksville to be executed, he gave the order to the firing squad \"What I have done, I have done as a principle of right. Aim at the heart. Fire!\"  Of the first volley, only one shot hit McCullough, and he survived.  He requested for his leg, which had been pinned under him, to be straightened, and was then executed via pistol shots.  McCullough's final words were \"May God forgive you this cold-blooded murder.\"[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nWayne Eugene DuMond (September 10, 1949\u00a0\u2013 August 31, 2005) was an American criminal convicted of murder and rape.\nDuMond's life sentence for a rape conviction received intense nationwide attention in late 2007, when his parole became an issue for presidential candidate Mike Huckabee during the 2008 presidential campaign. Lois Davidson, mother of DuMond rape/murder victim Carol Sue Shields, appeared in a one-minute video entitled \"Lois Davidson tells her story\" which was posted on YouTube. The commercial attacked Huckabee's efforts to get DuMond released from prison early.\nDuMond was a soldier in the Vietnam War and worked as a handyman and carpenter in communities around DeWitt and Forrest City and in Texas.[3] A decorated military veteran, DuMond told reporters that he \"helped slaughter a village of Cambodians\".[4] On August 8, 1972, DuMond was charged with murder in Lawton, Oklahoma. He committed the crime with help from two other men.[5]\nDuMond used the 17-year-old daughter of one of his accomplices to entice the victim to an isolated location, where DuMond and his accomplices beat him to death with a claw hammer. Prosecutors did not charge DuMond after he agreed to testify against the two others, though he admitted in court that he was among those who attacked the murder victim.\nOn October 19, 1973, DuMond was charged with molesting a teenage girl in the parking lot of a shopping center in Tacoma, Washington. The second-degree assault charge resulted in a five-year deferred sentence and mandatory drug counseling during the five-year probation.[4][5] On September 28, 1976, DuMond was charged with raping a woman in DeWitt, Arkansas. The charges were dropped before trial with the condition he undergo counseling.[5]\nDuMond received his second sexual assault conviction from a rape perpetrated in Forrest City, Arkansas in 1984. The victim, Ashley Stevens, was a 17-year-old cheerleader and a third cousin of then-Governor Bill Clinton.[6]\nIn March 1985, after his arrest but before his trial, DuMond claimed he was attacked in his home by two men and castrated. No arrests were made in the incident. Phil Ostermann, the Arkansas State Police investigator who handled the castration case, noted in his report that Dr. Jeff Whitfield of the Elvis Presley Trauma Center in Memphis examined DuMond after the incident, and was asked by DuMond's wife whether it was possible the castration was self-inflicted. Whitfield responded that it was possible, and he had noted similar cases of self-mutilation in the past.[6] Fletcher Long, the attorney who prosecuted DuMond for the rape of Ashley Stevens, was skeptical that DuMond could have castrated himself, but he also doubted DuMond's account because there was no evidence of a struggle, or that he had been tied up (which should have left ligature marks), and there was a two-thirds-empty half-gallon bottle of Jim Beam whiskey at the scene of the supposed assault.[6]\nWhile in prison, DuMond successfully sued the St. Francis County and Sheriff Coolidge Conlee, who publicly displayed DuMond's severed testicles and later flushed them down the toilet. DuMond was sentenced to life plus 20 years in prison.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "Stanis\u0142aw Kiecal (September 14, 1886 \u2013 October 15, 1910), better known in the boxing world as Stanley Ketchel, was an American professional boxer who became one of the greatest World Middleweight Champions in history.[1] He was nicknamed \"The Michigan Assassin.\" He was murdered at a ranch in Conway, Missouri, at the age of 24.\nHe was born in 1886 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Tomasz Kiecal and Julia Kiecal (n\u00e9e Olbinska), whose family immigrated from the village of Sulmierzyce in Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski, Guberniya, in modern-day central Poland.[2]\nHe avoided school, instead falling in with a gang of street kids and often getting into fist fights. At twelve years old, he ran away from home, becoming a child hobo. As a teenager he lived in Butte, Montana, where he found employment first as a hotel bellhop and then as a bouncer. This profession obviously led to many scraps that established his reputation as the best fist fighter in town. Soon enough sixteen-year-old Stanley was performing in backroom boxing matches with older locals for twenty dollars a week. He began traveling throughout Montana, offering to take on any man brave enough to face him. Between 1903 and 1906, he lost just twice in thirty-nine contests and, in 1907, moved to California, where he knew most of boxing's big names and big fights waited for him.[3]\nOnly a middleweight, Ketchel was also known for taking on heavyweights, who sometimes outweighed him by more than 30 pounds (14\u00a0kg). According to hearsay, before each of his fights, he would imagine that his opponent had insulted his mother, with whom he had a very close relationship; thus, his anger would motivate him to fight with fury.\nHe started boxing professionally in 1903, at 16, in Butte, Montana. In his first fight, Ketchel knocked out Kid Tracy in one round. In his second fight, he was beaten by decision in six rounds by Maurice Thompson. He boxed his first 41 bouts in Montana, and had a record of 36 wins, two losses, and three draws during that span. He lost once more to Thompson in their rematch and then controversially drew with him in their rubber match, in a bout that many people thought Ketchel had won. Afterwards, he went on to beat Tom Kingsley, among others, before moving his campaign on to California in 1907.\nThere, he won three fights that year, and drew one in Marysville against the man many considered the World Middleweight Champion, Joe Thomas. In his next bout, Thomas and he had a rematch and Ketchel won, by knockout in 32 rounds. Ketchel was then recognized by many as the World Middleweight Champion. He finished the year by beating Thomas again, this time by decision.\nOn February 8, 1908, Ketchel met the man who was generally recognized as the World Welterweight Champion and one of the leading middleweights of the era, Mike \"Twin\" Sullivan, knocking him out in the first round and winning general recognition as World Middleweight Champion. Sullivan often fought above the welterweight limit, making him a light middleweight. Whether Ketchel became world champion when he defeated Thomas or Mike Sullivan has always been up to debate, but the fact remains that Mike Sullivan and not Thomas is historically remembered as a world champion.\nHe proceeded to retain the title against Mike's twin brother, Jack \"Twin\" Sullivan, also a former world champion, by a knockout in 20 rounds; against future world champion Billy Papke by decision in 10; against Hugo Kelly by a knockout in three and against Thomas, by a knockout in two.\nThen, he lost the belt to Papke by a knockout in 12, but Papke and he had an immediate rematch and Ketchel regained the title when he beat Papke by a knockout in 11 in their third match.\n",

He was a pastor of The Journey, a fellowship of churches in St. Louis, Missouri, which he founded in 2002. He served as the chaplain to the St. Louis Cardinals and was the author of several books. A prominent figure within New Calvinism, he was the vice-president of the Acts 29 Network, an international church planting organization, and a council member of The Gospel Coalition.\nHe died by suicide in May 2020.\nPatrick was born in Marion, Illinois. He became a Christian while in high school, where he was an all-conference, all-area catcher on the baseball team. After beginning a successful ministry in high school, he pursued pastoral training rather than a college baseball career. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Bible and Biblical Languages from Southwest Baptist University (1994), graduated summa cum laude from Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (M.Div., 1997), and received a Doctor of Ministry degree from Covenant Theological Seminary (2010). He married in 1993 and had four children.\nPatrick moved from suburban Kansas City, Missouri to St. Louis in 2002 to plant The Journey in the urban core.[1] The church has seen unprecedented growth in the city of St. Louis and the broader metropolitan region.[2] The Journey is now a multi-site ministry with 6 churches in Missouri and Illinois, including Patrick's hometown of Marion.[3] The church has been scrutinized for its cultural engagement by the Missouri Baptist Convention and received national media attention regarding one of its outreach ministries, \"Theology at the Bottleworks,\" for being held at Schlafly Bottleworks, a brewery in Maplewood, MO.[4]\nIn his role as the chaplain to the St. Louis Cardinals, Patrick regularly led chapel services and Bible studies during the baseball season.[5] He was present for the players either before or after home games.[6] Shortly after the end of the 2013 season, Patrick officiated the wedding of Cardinals pitcher Shelby Miller.[7] As a chaplain, Patrick was a part of Baseball Chapel, an international ministry recognized by Major and Minor League Baseball, which is responsible for the appointment and oversight of all team chapel leaders (over 500 throughout professional baseball).[8]\nPatrick was a vice-president of the Acts 29 Network, and was a council member of The Gospel Coalition,[9] a group of Reformed Evangelical leaders from around the United States, including D. A. Carson, Tim Keller, and John Piper. He has written for Christianity Today and The Leadership Journal,[10]  and contributed to The Resurgence blog.[11] He has been interviewed by The Christian Post.[12] He has also appeared on Fox & Friends,[13] and has been discussed by The New York Times, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and BBC News Online.[14]\nOn April 13, 2016, it was announced that the Board of Elders of The Journey had removed Patrick from his position and required him to step down from all internal and external leadership positions. The reasons given were \"pastoral misconduct\" and a \"historical pattern of sin\".[15] A letter from the elders made it clear that the misconduct did not involve adultery, but there was a violation of the \"high standard for elders in marriage through inappropriate meetings, conversations, and phone calls with two women\". In addition, the historical sins were listed and included lack of self-control, manipulation and lying, domineering, misuse of power, and refusal of personal accountability. The elders indicated that they had raised these issues with Patrick over a period of a few years, but he had repeatedly failed to address them.[16] Patrick's name was removed from The Gospel Coalition's council[17] and the board of directors of the Acts 29 Network.[18] His disciplining was reported in the Christian press.[19][20] In a conference in Las Vegas, in 2017, Patrick talked about the lessons he learned in losing his church.[21]\nAfter a restoration process[22] led by Seacoast Church Founding Pastor Greg Surratt, Patrick joined the staff of Seacoast in June 2017 as a teaching pastor. He cofounded The Pastors Collective podcast with Greg Surratt in 2019.[citation needed] Patrick led Enneagram intensives as a coach through Crosspoint Ministries. He also worked with The Association of Related Churches (ARC), coaching pastors on building a healthy culture.[23]\nPatrick died on May 7, 2020 in Pacific, Missouri of a self-inflicted gunshot wound while target shooting.[24][25][26]\n",

He received a college degree from Jefferson College in 1810.\nLucas engaged in considerable land speculation including buying much of the land in the wake of the New Madrid earthquake in 1811. He also received a large land grant in Normandy in what is now suburban St. Louis.[1]\nHe was the law partner to Rufus Easton in St. Louis and St. Charles and remained in this position until he was killed in a duel. He joined a volunteer Army unit in the War of 1812.[2]\nAfter the war he served on the Legislature of the Missouri Territory.\nIn August 1817 Lucas and Benton as attorneys were opposite sides of a court case and accused each other of lying. When they encountered each other again in an August 1817 election, the 24-year-old Lucas challenged whether 35-year-old Benton owned property and could legally vote.  Benton replied he owned slaves and paid taxes on them and could vote and then called Lucas according to one version an \"insolent puppy.\"  Another slightly different witness account said Benton told the judges, \"Gentlemen, if you have any questions to ask, I am prepared to answer, but I do not propose to answer charges made by any puppy who may happen to run across my path.\"\nLucas then challenged Benton on August 11 to a duel with a note, \"I am informed you applied to me on the day of the election the epithet of 'Puppy.' If so I shall expect that satisfaction which is due from one gentleman to another for such an indignity.\" The challenge arrived to Benton after he had spent the night at the wake of his dead friend Edward Hempstead.  Benton accepted but said that he wanted to complete the funeral.  The terms of the duel called for it to be held at 6 a.m. and the shots to be fired from 30 feet.\nThe two met on August 12, 1817 on Bloody Island. Lucas was shot in the neck and Benton was shot below the right knee. Lucas was unable to continue, and Benton subsequently released Lucas from an obligation to continue the duel.\nRumors circulated questioning Benton's motives and whether Benton had deliberately set the duel rules so they were farther apart. On September 23 Benton challenged Lucas to a rematch, saying \"When I released you from your engagement to return to the island, I yielded to a feeling of generosity in my own bosom, and to a sentiment of deference to the judgment of others. From the reports which now fill the country it would seem that yourself and some of your friends have placed my conduct to very different motives. The object of this is to bring these calumnies to an end, and to give you an opportunity of justifying the great expectation which has been excited. Colonel Lawless will receive your terms, and I expect your distance not to exceed nine feet.\"\n",

        "paragraph": "The shooting of Antonio Martin occurred on December 23, 2014, in Berkeley, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Martin, an 18-year-old black male, was fatally shot by a white Berkeley police officer when Martin pulled a gun on him. The shooting sparked protests in the St. Louis area and other cities in the U.S. The shooting elicited comparison to the earlier shooting death of Michael Brown two miles away in Ferguson, Missouri.\nOn the night of December 23, 2014, a Berkeley Police Department officer responded to an employee's emergency phone call report at 11:11\u00a0pm of shoplifting by two men at a Mobil On the Run convenience store along the 6800 block of North Hanley Road.[1][2] An unidentified officer arrived at 11:15\u00a0p.m. in his police cruiser and saw two men just outside the store who matched the description of the suspects.[1]\nThe shooting happened in a parking lot outside a Mobil gas station. The police officer was not wearing a body camera and there were no shots fired by the teen's gun.[3] As the officer fired, he fell to the ground while running away, which was caught on video by the store's security cameras.[1][4] One of the shots fired by the officer struck Martin, another struck the tire of the officer's vehicle, and the third is unaccounted for.[4]\nPolice recovered a Hi-Point 9mm handgun from the scene, said to be Martin's, with five rounds in the magazine and one round in the chamber.[5][6]\nFootage of the incident was captured by surveillance cameras outside the convenience store.[1] According to police, several witness' accounts back up the officer's story that Martin was first to draw his weapon.[2] The officer said he was not wearing the body camera he had been issued earlier that day. The police car's dash-camera was likely not recording at the time.[6]\nThe officer is identified as a 34-year-old white male, and a six-year veteran of the department.[4] He had previously Served with the Country Club Hills, Missouri Police Department.[1] He is represented by attorney Brian Millikan who also represents St. Louis police officer Jason Flanery in the October killing of VonDeritt Myers.[4]\nSt. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch assigned a prosecutor to the county's investigation. The City of Berkeley will conduct its own independent investigation.[1]\nDespite complaints about the timeliness of medical attention to arrive, paramedics arrived six minutes after the shooting. Martin was declared dead, and his body covered, by 11:28\u00a0p.m.[2] A crowd of onlookers and protesters gathered at the scene within 20 minutes of the shooting.[1][2] The county crimes against persons unit arrived at 12:15\u00a0a.m.[6] As the crowd grew angry, protesters clashed with law enforcement working to protect the scene for investigators collecting evidence. The crowd grew to an estimated 300 people as tensions escalated. Some threw rocks and other projectiles at them.[1]\nMedia crews and surveillance video recorded an individual lighting fires with lighter fluid inside and outside the same store when looters broke in. Police say 19-year-old Joshua Williams of St. Louis was the individual. Williams, a frequently quoted advocate for peace in the aftermath of the Michael Brown shooting, was charged days later with arson in the first degree, a felony; felony burglary and misdemeanor stealing. On video Williams confessed to police of lighting the fires.[7] Four others were arrested for assault-related offenses. Martin's body was removed from the crime scene at around 1:40\u00a0a.m. Several protesters lingered at the site throughout the night.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "\n\nPamela Marie Hupp (n\u00e9e  Neumann; born October 10, 1958) is an American murderer, serving a life sentence in Missouri's Chillicothe Correctional Center for the 2016 shooting of Louis Gumpenberger in her home in O'Fallon, Missouri. Hupp's claim that she had shot Gumpenberger (who had mental and physical disabilities) in self-defense after he pursued her into her home wielding a knife was not accepted by law enforcement. She ultimately entered an Alford plea before charges of first-degree murder and armed criminal action could go to trial. \nTestimony from Hupp had played a key role in the 2013 conviction of Russ Faria for the murder of his wife, Betsy Faria, who was stabbed to death in her home in Troy, Missouri, in 2011. After a successful appeal and second trial in 2015, Faria was exonerated after his defense attorney was permitted to introduce evidence that was withheld from the original trial jury, some of which implicated Hupp \u2013 the beneficiary of a life insurance policy held by Betsy \u2013 as the killer. Law enforcement have theorized that Hupp tricked Gumpenberger into entering her home and then murdered him in a failed attempt to frame Faria. In July 2021, Hupp was charged with the first-degree murder of Betsy Faria. \nHupp has also been investigated in connection with the death of her mother, Shirley Neumann, who died in 2013 from injuries sustained in a fall from the balcony of her third-floor apartment in Fenton, Missouri. A tip-off to police accused Hupp of killing Neumann for financial gain. Neumann's death was initially ruled an accident, but in November 2017 the chief medical examiner for St. Louis County changed the cause of death to \"undetermined\", referencing the events in O'Fallon and Troy. An investigation into Neumann's death by the St. Louis County Police Department was inconclusive.\nThe killings of Betsy Faria and Louis Gumpenberger have been the subject of significant media coverage, including extensive reporting from the local Fox affiliate station KTVI in St. Louis and six Dateline NBC episodes airing from 2014 to 2022, as well as a Dateline NBC true crime podcast. A scripted television series featuring actress Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as Hupp, The Thing About Pam, premiered on NBC in March\u2013April 2022.\nPamela Marie Neumann was born on October 10, 1958,[1] and grew up in Dellwood, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis, and attended Riverview Gardens High School. In her young adulthood she held several jobs in the life insurance industry; on two occasions, she was fired for forging signatures. In 2001, Hupp and her husband settled in O'Fallon, where she worked as an administrator for State Farm and flipped houses on the side via a company called H2 Partners LLC. By 2010, Hupp had stopped working and was claiming disability benefits for back, leg, and neck pain.[2][3]\nIn 2011, Hupp and Betsy Faria, a friend terminally ill with cancer, reportedly collected money for a family also impacted by cancer. St. Louis station KTVI discovered several years later that the family did not know about the collection; information was presented to Lincoln County authorities in 2014, but was not investigated further. There was no evidence to suggest Faria knew the fundraiser was questionable, with her friends recalling that she said she was excited to be helping a struggling family, even though she herself was dying. One of them, Kathleen Meyer, said, \"This was going to be a legacy for her, to leave something like this behind in her memory.\"[4]\nElizabeth Kay Meyer Faria (\"Betsy\") was a coworker of Hupp at State Farm. She lived in Troy, Missouri, with her husband, Russell Scott Faria (\"Russ\"), and two daughters from a previous relationship.[5] In 2010, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. In October 2011, Betsy learned the cancer had metastasized to her liver[6] and was terminal.[7]\n",

He took a leave of absence in 1947 and spent eight years training the police forces of Liberia.[6] As a pilot, Jordan flew his own plane around the country.[3] In 1948, he helped coordinate the rescue of the French High Commissioner of West Africa and sixteen other French officials after their plane made a forced landing. Jordan was awarded the Chevalier of the Order of the African Star by Liberian President William Tubman in 1948.[7]\nIn 1951, Jordan became a life member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).[7] He returned to Kansas City in February 1952 and was promoted to police lieutenant, the first African-American to hold that rank in the KCPD's history. However, he discovered that he had little power in the department, so he resigned and went back to Liberia for three years.[3] Jordan returned to Kansas City permanently in the mid-1950s and purchased the Green Duck Tavern.[3]\nIn 1958, Jordan became a Democratic committeeman for the 14th Ward of Kansas City.[3] In 1962, Jordan and Bruce R. Watkins co-founded Freedom, Inc.,[8][7] an organization which advocated political awareness among African-Americans in the city by organizing a massive voter registration drive and promoting black political candidates. In 1963, Jordan and Watkins helped pass an accommodations ordinance, desegregating all public facilities in Kansas City.[6]\nIn 1964, Freedom, Inc. put forward eight candidates for office, seven of which won.[9] Among them was Jordan, who was elected to the first of three terms in the Missouri House of Representatives.[10] Jordan was campaigning for a fourth term at the time he was murdered. Shortly before his death, he described himself as a \"radical\", adding, \"I'm not a conformist but there are bounds of reason.\"[2]\nAt about 1:00\u00a0a.m. on July 15, 1970, Jordan was killed just outside his Green Duck Tavern by three shotgun blasts. Eyewitnesses reported that the three killers were African-American. The shotgun had been stolen and was abandoned immediately. When it was recovered, it was traced to a burglary five years earlier in Independence, Missouri.[11] Three men were arrested for the murder, including at least one affiliated with a criminal group called the \"Black Mafia\". One man was acquitted, and charges were dropped against the other two suspects.[12]\nUpon his death, his widow, Orchid I. Jordan, became a candidate for his legislative seat. She won the election, and served for sixteen years in the Missouri House of Representatives.[6] She died on December 25, 1995, at the age of 85.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "John Lazia, also known as Brother John (September 22, 1896 \u2013 July 10, 1934), was an American organized crime figure in Kansas City, Missouri, during Prohibition.\nAccording to his draft card for World War I, Lazia (spelled Lazio on the card, in the 1910 census, and on his tombstone) was born in New York in 1895. He dropped out of high school in the eighth grade.[citation needed]  By 1915, Lazia was an office clerk during the day and a robber at night.[citation needed]  In 1916, after robbing a man on the street, Lazia was confronted by a police officer. After an exchange of gunfire, the officer arrested him. Lazia was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 12 years in prison. However, nine months later in 1917, the lieutenant governor of Missouri paroled Lazia if he joined the US Army. Lazia ignored the parole condition and instead started working for the political machine, controlled by Tom Pendergast. Lazia, on his draft card, claimed to be the supporter of his mother and father and to have some additional difficulties.  (Draft card illegible.)\nBy the early 1920s, Lazia had graduated from street crime to organizing voters for the Pendergast machine and supplying bars with bootleg whiskey. His closest associate and bodyguard was Charles Carrollo. At one point when Lazia was arrested for bootlegging, Carrollo accepted the blame and a prison sentence for him.\nBy the late 1920s, Lazia had become the supreme gang boss in Kansas City. In 1928, Lazia was appointed head of the Northside's Democratic Club. Lazia owned a soft drink company, several upscale gambling resorts in the city, a profitable loanshark operation, and even a bail bond company.\nLazia enjoyed considerable political power within both the Kansas City Police Department and the city administration. In 1929, after failing to file a $82,000 federal tax return, Lazia was convicted of tax evasion and sentenced to one year in prison. However, thanks in part to the influence of ward boss Tom Pendergast, the government released Lazia  pending appeal. Many civic reformers decried Lazia's influence and power but were unable to effect any changes.\nLazia's criminal activities translated into a comfortable and pleasant life. He and his wife lived in a luxury apartment in Kansas City. Lazia vacationed at his resort on Lake Lotawana in Western Missouri, where he maintained several speedboats. Lazia also owned several thoroughbred race horses, which he raced at tracks around the United States. Lazia was a constant presence at sporting and civic events and donated regularly to charities. Despite all of his criminal activities, Lazia was able to maintain a generally-positive public profile.\nAs the 1930s began, Lazia began experiencing more competition from other gangsters. In October 1932, Lazia's men broke into the Army armory in Kansas City to obtain more guns to fight these competitors. In June 1933, a local gang leader, Vernon Miller, requested several gunmen to free a bank robber, Frank Nash, who was being transported by train through Kansas City on June 17. The plan was to  ambush the law enforcement escort at Union Station in Kansas City and to free their prisoner. Lazia reportedly provided Miller with Adam \"Eddie\" Richetti and Charles \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd, a notorious bank robber. The Union Station massacre resulted in five deaths: four law enforcement officers and Nash.\nThe tremendous public outrage over the shootout convinced the Pendergast machine that Lazia had become a liability that needed to be eliminated. Without his political protection, Lazia was indicted for bootlegging, illegal gambling and tax evasion. Lazia eventually pleaded guilty to tax evasion and was sentenced to one year in prison.\nThe Pendergast politicians also started funding a competitor, the former Lazia lieutenant Michael LaCapra, to set up competing gambling dens and distribution networks for alcohol and narcotics.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn August 9, 2014, 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.[2]\nBrown was accompanied by his 22-year-old male friend Dorian Johnson, who later stated that Brown had robbed a convenience store before the shooting occurred.[3] Wilson, a white male Ferguson police officer, said that an altercation ensued when Brown attacked him in his police vehicle for control of Wilson's service pistol. The struggle continued until the pistol fired.[4] Johnson said that Wilson initiated a confrontation by grabbing Brown by the neck through Wilson's patrol car window, threatening him and then shooting at him.[5] At this point, both Wilson and Johnson state that Brown and Johnson fled, with Wilson pursuing Brown shortly thereafter. Wilson stated that Brown stopped and charged him after a short pursuit. Johnson contradicted this account, stating that Brown turned around with his hands raised after Wilson shot at his back. According to Johnson, Wilson then shot Brown multiple times until Brown fell to the ground. In the entire altercation, Wilson fired a total of twelve bullets, including twice during the struggle in the car.[6] Brown was struck six times, all in the front of his body.[7][8][9]\nThis event ignited unrest in Ferguson. Witnesses to the shooting claimed Brown had his hands up in surrender or said \"don't shoot\", so protesters later used the slogan \"Hands up, don't shoot\".[10] A subsequent FBI investigation said that there was no evidence that Brown had done so.[11] Protests, both peaceful and violent, continued for more than a week in Ferguson; police later established a nightly curfew.\nThe response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests was strongly criticized by both the media and politicians. Concerns were raised over insensitivity, tactics, and a militarized response. Missouri governor Jay Nixon ordered local police organizations to cede much of their authority to the Missouri State Highway Patrol.\nA grand jury was called and given extensive evidence from Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County Prosecutor. On November 24, 2014, McCulloch announced the St. Louis County grand jury had decided not to indict Wilson.[12] In March 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice reported the conclusion of its own investigation and cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. It found forensic evidence supported Wilson's account, and that witnesses who corroborated the officer's account were credible. Witnesses who had incriminated him were found to be not credible, with some admitting they had not directly seen the events.[13][14] The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Wilson shot Brown in self-defense.[15][16]\nIn 2020, St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell, spent five months reviewing the case with an eye to charge Wilson with either manslaughter or murder.  In July, Bell announced he could not charge Wilson with any crime.[17]\nMichael Orlandus Darrion Brown[18] (May 20, 1996[19] \u2013 August 9, 2014) graduated from Normandy High School in St. Louis County eight days before his death, completing an alternative education program.[20] At the time of his death, he was 18 years old, 6\u00a0feet 4\u00a0inches (1.93 meters) tall, and weighed 292 pounds (132 kilograms).[9] He was an amateur rap musician who posted his songs on the popular music-sharing site SoundCloud under the handle \"Big'Mike.\"[21] He was two days from starting a training program for heating and air conditioning repair at Vatterott College technical school.[22]\nDarren Dean Wilson[23] (born May 14, 1986, in Fort Worth, Texas)[24] was 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m) tall and weighed about 210\u00a0lb (95\u00a0kg).[25][26] Wilson's first police job was in the town of Jennings, Missouri, where he began working in 2009.[26][27] With respect to this job, Wilson said to The New Yorker in 2015, \"I'd never been in an area where there was that much poverty.\"[27] The police force in Jennings was shut down by the town's city council in March 2011.[26] In October 2011, Wilson began working for the Ferguson Police Department.[28] In February 2013, Wilson won a commendation from the Ferguson Police Department after he apprehended a suspect who was later charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and resisting arrest.[28]\nSurveillance video which was publicly released in the 2017 documentary film Stranger Fruit shows Michael Brown walking into Ferguson Market and Liquor at 1:13 a.m., ten-and-a-half hours before he entered the store for the final time. The footage shows Brown handing a young clerk a brown package, believed by the filmmaker to be marijuana, and then receiving an unpurchased package of cigarillos from the store. After the video was rediscovered and made public in 2017, some, including Brown's family, said they believed Brown had left the package there for safekeeping and later returned to retrieve it. The store owner disputed this through an attorney who dismissed claims that the store traded him \"cigarillos for pot.\" The lawyer claimed \"[t]he reason he [Brown] gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they [the staff] wanted it back.\"[29] The store's attorney said the video had been in the hands of Brown's family and law enforcement since the initial investigation, and said the video had been edited to remove the portion where the store clerk returned Brown's package to him.[30] Following this, on March 13, 2017, unedited footage from the store was released by the St. Louis County prosecutor to try to settle questions.[31]\n",

He was involved in three duels with prominent Missouri politicians before being killed in a duel.\nBarton, a younger brother of Senator David Barton, was born in Jefferson County, Tennessee.\nHe moved to St. Louis, Missouri in 1809.  He studied law under Rufus Easton, who was Missouri Territory's second representative to Congress.  After being admitted to the bar, he and Edward Bates, Missouri's first attorney general, formed a law firm.[1]\nBarton was the first Secretary of State, but resigned to become district attorney of St. Louis, Missouri.\nIn 1816, he fought a duel with Thomas Hempstead, brother of Edward Hempstead, Missouri's first representative to Congress.  Bates was his second.  Thomas Hart Benton was Hempstead's second.  The duel ended in no bloodshed.[1]\nIn 1817, he was second to Charles Lucas in two duels with Benton. After having been wounded the first time, Lucas was killed during the second duel.[1]\nIn 1823, David Barton opposed the reappointment of William Rector as Surveyor General for Missouri, Illinois and Arkansas, saying that Rector was hiring his relatives as surveyors and overpaying his surveyors.  Rector had overseen the surveying the Louisiana Purchase, including the establishment of the Beginning Point of the Louisiana Purchase Survey.[2] William Rector had previously been hired to survey the location route of the Buffalo Trace before an Indian treaty line was established.[3]\nJoshua Barton made the charges in a letter signed \"Philo\" to the weekly newspaper the St. Louis Republican.  Rector's brother, Thomas Rector, contacted the paper and found out that Barton had written the letter and challenged him to a duel. They met at 6 p.m. on June 30, 1823, on Bloody Island (where the previous duels had occurred).  Barton was killed instantly, while Thomas Rector was not hurt. Rector died in 1825 in a knife fight in St. Louis.[1]  President James Monroe did not reappoint William Rector.[4]\n",

The family regularly attended Mass, and both sons regularly attended religious education courses.\nAs a child Berdella was intelligent, but a loner who rarely played outside his home and seldom had friends visit to socialize. He had a speech impediment and wore thick glasses from the age of five because he was severely nearsighted. He was also diagnosed with high blood pressure for which he took several medications. Berdella was largely unathletic, whereas his younger brother, Daniel\u00a0\u2013 seven years his junior\u00a0\u2013 displayed an aptitude for various sports from an early age. As Berdella's father valued sports and physical education, he viewed his older son's lack of interest in sports as a sign of failure, and often compared him unfavorably with his younger brother. Occasionally, Berdella's father physically and emotionally abused his children, and beat them with a leather strap.[3]:\u200a183\u200a\nBerdella performed well academically, though teachers often found him difficult to teach, in part due both to his aloofness, and his being the recipient of bullying by other students. Because of this he seldom socialized with his peers.[3]:\u200a46\u201347\u200a\nWhen Berdella reached puberty he discovered that he was homosexual; initially, he kept this fact a closely guarded secret, and he did not become open about his sexuality for several years.

He murdered three people, for which he was sentenced to death and subsequently executed in 1990.[1]\nStokes was one of 10 children who dropped out of school in 8th grade.[2]\nStokes' first recorded crime occurred on April 30, 1969. Together with David H. Richards and Allen E. Smith (17 and 18, respectively), they entered a tavern on 3044 Easton Avenue in St. Louis, posing as customers before drawing their pistols and announcing it was a robbery.[3] The customers and the owner, Ignatius DiManuele, were forced to lay down on the ground as the three men emptied the cash register. While doing this, one of the robbers pointed their gun at DiManuele and proceeded to shoot him. When questioned about his reasons, the killer simply replied that he \"wanted to get a whitey.\"[4] After that, Stokes and his two accomplices escaped in his vehicle. About two weeks later, Winford was stopped for questioning by Detectives Brian Graft and Edward DeVere, during which he threw a pistol out of his car. Both men noticed this and immediately arrested him. After some questioning, they learned about Richards and Smith, who were captured soon after as well. Witnesses to the robbery identified all three of them as the ones behind the DiManuele robbery.[4]\nStokes was sent off to await his trial at Homer G. Phillips Hospital, but several months later, along with four other inmates, he managed to escape. On October 23, 1970, when Sheriff's Deputy John Curtis entered the ward to collect the supper dishes, Stokes grabbed his revolver and forced him to the center. He had Curtis strip off his clothing and take off his shoes, taking them, as well as the keys to his car. He then tied up the deputy with pieces of a bedsheet and fled with the other prisoners. Two other prisoners were left behind, who turned back and released Curtis from the restraints. Three of the convicts were later recaptured, with the exception of Stokes and 18-year-old Joseph Wallace.[5] He was arrested not long after, and sentenced to 9 years imprisonment for manslaughter and three other felony charges.[6]\nAfter some years, Stokes was released from prison. On December 7, 1977, he knocked on the door of 71-year-old Erssie Lucas, intent on robbing him. When Lucas opened, he began beating him with a claw hammer, leaving the old man on the ground and stealing an undetermined amount of cash. Erssie survived the assault.[7]\nOnly a few days later, on December 12, Stokes broke into the apartment of 73-year-old widow Marie Montgomery while looking for a place to rob. He shot her in the neck and right arm, killing her, and thereafter ransacked the premises, stealing a wristwatch. Montgomery's body would later be found by her niece, who had come to check up on Marie because she had missed the Sunday church services.[8] Stokes was later arrested on January 15, 1978, on charges of armed robbery and armed criminal action, and sent for pre-trial mental evaluation at the Malcolm Bliss Mental Health Center. That same afternoon, Stokes managed to escape from the facility, with authorities right on his tail.[9]\nOn February 21, 1978, Stokes was at a bar in northern St. Louis County when he met a 33-year-old Washington University faculty waitress named Pamela Benda. They went back to her apartment in University City, whereupon Winford started beating and stabbing Benda with a kitchen knife, before eventually strangling her.[10] He took off her clothes and left her body in the bedroom, before rummaging through her drawer and pocketing some jewelry.[11] He then got into her 1974 Plymouth Scamp and drove to South Bend, Indiana, where he had then been living with his wife, Ramona. He later pawned the jewelry.[10] Initial investigations focused on Benda's boyfriend, with whom she had had scuffles the previous months, but he was cleared later on. It was determined that  Benda had likely been killed by somebody she knew, as there were no signs of forced entry into her home.[11] The case would later be named the \"Mr. Goodbar\" case, after a copy of the 1975 novel Looking for Mr. Goodbar by Judith Rossner was found on a bedside table in Benda's apartment.[12]\nIn June, Stokes was indicted for the murders of Montgomery and Benda.[13] He was sent off to Homer G. Phillips Hospital yet again, where he was to await trial for the murder charges. On December 3, however, along with Samuel Smith and Earl Davis, Stokes overpowered the guards, stole their guns and clothes, and fled.[14] On the following day, one of the guards, Richard Campbell, resigned from his position for breaking security regulations.[15] On December 11, all three of the fugitives were arrested by FBI agents in Chicago's South Side.[16]\nOn September 10, 1979, Stokes pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for killing Montgomery and was sentenced to 50 years in prison. He was then offered a concurrent 50-year sentence if he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for killing Benda. On September 20, 1979, Stokes, despite facing possible execution, rejected the offer and took the case to trial. The reason was that an additional murder conviction would make it much harder for him to win parole.[17][18]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn January 5, 1935, a man who had given his name as Roland T. Owen, later identified as Artemus Ogletree, died at a hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, United States from beating and stabbing injuries. His death was preceded by a two-day stay in Room 1046 at the Hotel President in what is now the city's Power & Light District marked by communication with someone named \"Don\", and unusual behavior and incidents noted by the hotel's staff, before he was found wounded in his room the morning of his death. When no next of kin could be located, leading to suspicions that his name was an alias, his body was stored in a local funeral parlor for almost two months. A planned burial in the city's potter's field was averted when an anonymous donor provided funds for a funeral and a floral arrangement signed \"Louise\".\nThe man's true identity remained unknown for a year and a half until Ruby Ogletree, an Alabama woman who had seen a photo of a distinctive scar on his head in the news, identified him as her son Artemus. She said he had left Birmingham in 1934 at the age of 17 to hitchhike to California. Later she received two letters purportedly from him, some from as far away as Egypt. In August 1935, a caller claiming to be from Memphis, Tennessee told her that Artemus was in Cairo. The letters had also been sent after Artemus' death. Records kept by shipping companies found no records that Ogletree had gone to Egypt. No other suspect has ever been identified.\nThe letters later were used to link the killing to a 1937 murder in New York, but no charges were filed against the man arrested in that case, one of whose aliases had been \"Donald Kelso\". The FBI later investigated but was unable to produce any new leads.\nIn 2012, a historian at the Kansas City Public Library wrote two posts on the library's blog about the case. At the end of the last one he revealed that in 2003 or 2004, he had taken a call from someone out of state related to the case. The caller said that they had been helping to inventory the belongings of a recently deceased elderly person when they found a box with newspaper clippings about the Ogletree case and an item mentioned repeatedly in the stories, but they refused to say what that item was. The Kansas City police continue to investigate.\nArtemus Ogletree was born in Florida in 1915, one of three children. During his childhood, an accident with some hot grease left a sizable scar on his head above his ear,[1] which remained hairless afterward. In 1934 he left his family, by then living in Birmingham, Alabama,[2][1] to hitchhike to California. He kept them updated on his progress by mail; they wired him money.[3]\nEarly on the afternoon of January 2, 1935, Ogletree walked into the Hotel President, in what is now the Power & Light District of Kansas City, Missouri, and asked for an interior room several floors up, giving his name as Roland T. Owen, with a Los Angeles address. Staff remembered him as dressed well and wearing a dark overcoat; he brought no bags with him.[4]\nOgletree paid for one night. The staff noted that in addition to the visible scar on his temple, he had cauliflower ear, and concluded he was probably a boxer or professional wrestler. They believed him to be in his early 20s.[4]\nRandolph Propst, a bellhop, accompanied Ogletree up in the elevator to the 10th floor. On the way, Ogletree told him that he had spent the previous night at the nearby Muehlebach Hotel but found the $5 ($100 in current dollars[5]) nightly rate too high. Propst opened Room 1046, which per the guest's request was on the inside, overlooking the hotel's courtyard rather than the street outside. He watched as Ogletree took a hairbrush, comb and toothpaste from his overcoat pocket, the extent of his unpacking.[4]\n",

Raised in the \"Little Dixie\" area of Western Missouri, James and his family maintained strong Southern sympathies. He and his brother Frank James joined pro-Confederate guerrillas known as \"bushwhackers\" operating in Missouri and Kansas during the American Civil War. As followers of William Quantrill and \"Bloody Bill\" Anderson, they were accused of committing atrocities against Union soldiers and civilian abolitionists, including the Centralia Massacre in 1864.\nAfter the war, as members of various gangs of outlaws, Jesse and Frank robbed banks, stagecoaches, and trains across the Midwest, gaining national fame and often popular sympathy despite the brutality of their crimes. The James brothers were most active as members of their own gang from about 1866 until 1876, when as a result of their attempted robbery of a bank in Northfield, Minnesota, several members of the gang were captured or killed. They continued in crime for several years afterward, recruiting new members, but came under increasing pressure from law enforcement seeking to bring them to justice. On April 3, 1882, Jesse James was shot and killed by Robert Ford, a new recruit to the gang who hoped to collect a reward on James's head and a promised amnesty for his previous crimes. Already a celebrity in life, James became a legendary figure of the Wild West after his death.\nPopular portrayals of James as an embodiment of Robin Hood, robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, are a case of romantic revisionism as there is no evidence his gang shared any loot from their robberies with anyone outside their network.[1] Scholars and historians have characterized James as one of many criminals inspired by the regional insurgencies of ex-Confederates following the Civil War, rather than as a manifestation of alleged economic justice or of frontier lawlessness.[2] James continues to be one of the most famous figures from the era, and his life has been dramatized and memorialized numerous times.\nJesse Woodson James was born on September 5, 1847, in Clay County, Missouri, near the site of present-day Kearney.[3] This area of Missouri was largely settled by people from the Upper South, especially Kentucky and Tennessee, and became known as Little Dixie for this reason. James had two full siblings: his elder brother, Alexander Franklin \"Frank\" James, and a younger sister, Susan Lavenia James. He was of English and Scottish descent. His father, Robert S. James, farmed commercial hemp in Kentucky and was a Baptist minister before coming to Missouri. After he married, he migrated to Bradford, Missouri and helped found William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri.[2] He held six slaves and more than 100 acres (0.40\u00a0km2) of farmland.\nRobert traveled to California during the Gold Rush to minister to those searching for gold;[4] he died there when James was three years old.[5] After Robert's death, his widow Zerelda remarried twice, first to Benjamin Simms in 1852 and then in 1855 to Dr. Reuben Samuel, who moved into the James family home. Jesse's mother and Samuel had four children together: Sarah Louisa, John Thomas, Fannie Quantrell, and Archie Peyton Samuel.[4][6] Zerelda and Samuel acquired a total of seven slaves, who served mainly as farmhands in tobacco cultivation.[6][7]\nThe approach of the American Civil War loomed large in the James\u2013Samuel household. Missouri was a border state, sharing characteristics of both North and South, but 75% of the population was from the South or other border states.[4] Clay County in particular was strongly influenced by the Southern culture of its rural pioneer families. Farmers raised the same crops and livestock as in the areas from which they had migrated. They brought slaves with them and purchased more according to their needs. The county counted more slaveholders and more slaves than most other regions of the state; in Missouri as a whole, slaves accounted for only 10 percent of the population, but in Clay County, they constituted 25 percent.[8] Aside from slavery, the culture of Little Dixie was Southern in other ways as well. This influenced how the population acted during and for a period of time after the war.\nAfter the passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in 1854, Clay County became the scene of great turmoil as the question of whether slavery would be expanded into the neighboring Kansas Territory bred tension and hostility. Many people from Missouri migrated to Kansas to try to influence its future. Much of the dramatic build-up to the Civil War centered on the violence that erupted on the Kansas\u2013Missouri border between pro- and anti-slavery militias.[7][9]\nAfter a series of campaigns and battles between conventional armies in 1861, guerrilla warfare gripped Missouri, waged between secessionist \"bushwhackers\" and Union forces which largely consisted of local militias known as \"jayhawkers\". A bitter conflict ensued, resulting in an escalating cycle of atrocities committed by both sides. Confederate guerrillas murdered civilian Unionists, executed prisoners, and scalped the dead. The Union presence enforced martial law with raids on homes, arrests of civilians, summary executions, and banishment of Confederate sympathizers from the state.[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn February 7, 2008, a gunman went on a shooting rampage at a public meeting in the city hall, leaving six people dead and one injured in Kirkwood, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. Charles Lee \"Cookie\" Thornton, aged 52, shot one police officer with a revolver across the side street from city hall and took the officer's handgun before entering city hall. Thornton reached council chambers with these two pistols shortly after the meeting began. There, he shot a police officer, the public works director, two council members, the mayor, and a reporter. In total, the gunman killed five and wounded two others; one of the two wounded victims, the mayor died seven months later in a hospice where he was receiving cancer care. The shooter died from two gunshot wounds in a shootout with police.[1][3][4]\nThornton parked his van on the side street near Kirkwood City Hall and saw Kirkwood Police Sgt. William Biggs, who was on duty but walking to pick up dinner nearby. In a parking lot across the side street from City Hall, Thornton confronted Biggs and shot him with a Smith & Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum revolver, killing him instantly. Before Thornton fired, Biggs had hit a distress signal on his radio to summon additional police officers.[1][7]\nThornton took Biggs' Smith & Wesson .40-caliber handgun and went inside City Hall. There, in the city council chambers, The Pledge of Allegiance had just been recited and the mayor was starting the city council meeting with 30 people attending. Thornton entered the room quietly from the back with both of his weapons concealed but soon got close to his intended victims. He first fatally shot Kirkwood Police Officer Tom Ballman in the head and continued shooting other victims at close range while reportedly repeating the phrase \"Shoot the mayor!\" He fatally shot council members Connie Karr and Michael H.T. Lynch, and Public Works Director Ken Yost. He shot Mayor Mike Swoboda twice in the head and left him for dead. Witnesses reported about 15 gunshots. Ignoring the four other council members, Thornton chased City Attorney John Hessel, who slowed Thornton by throwing chairs at him until escaping from the room.[8][9]\nAll of this gunfire was audible at the Kirkwood police department building, located across a small parking lot from the rear entrance to city hall. Two Kirkwood police officers rushed to the council chambers. There, Thornton fired on them from behind a desk. The officers returned fire; Thornton, who still had rounds left, sustained two gunshot wounds and died at the scene.[7][10][11]\nIn total, Thornton killed five people and wounded two, reporter Todd Smith and Mayor Mike Swoboda, who were taken to St. John's Mercy Medical Center, the latter in critical condition.[1][3][12] The mayor had been shot in the lower jaw, with the bullet exiting from his cheek, and was also shot in the back of his head. He underwent surgery on February 7 and again on February 8, the latter surgery lasting three hours.[13] Mayor Swoboda's condition was upgraded after a few days to \"serious\", and after two weeks to \"satisfactory\". Since then, he had begun eating soft food and talking. His family said that he had no memory of the shootings. He would need reconstructive surgery for his face; other long term health effects were unknown.[6]\nOn April 18, Swoboda returned to city hall to briefly address the last city council meeting before the expiration of his second and (due to term limits) final term as mayor.\nSeven months later, Swoboda died on September 6, 2008, in a hospice he had entered a week earlier. He had also been battling cancer.[citation needed]\nA reporter for the local Suburban Journals, Todd Smith, was shot in the hand but released from the hospital within 24 hours.[14]\nCharles Lee \"Cookie\" Thornton (December 23, 1955 \u2013 February 7, 2008)[15] was a lifelong resident of Meacham Park, an unincorporated predominantly African American community that bordered Kirkwood in St. Louis County, Missouri. In 1992, a ballot proposition appeared under which Kirkwood, an abutting, comparatively prosperous city with only a small percentage of African-American residents, would annex the low-income Meacham Park area. After spirited debate and campaigning, residents of both Meacham Park and Kirkwood approved the annexation. Upon annexation, the municipal codes of Kirkwood became the law for Meacham Park, which had previously lacked municipal codes due to its unincorporated status.[16][17]\n",

Ruane, Rohan grew up in North St. Louis's \"Kerry Patch\" neighborhood. As a young man, he found his way into many of the street gangs inhabiting his district. \"Skippy\" was known as a tough street fighter with nerves of steel. He didn't hesitate to attack police officers who attempted to stop him from committing crimes. Despite having a prominent chipped front tooth, Rohan was considered a ladies' man. People often commented on his half-lidded eyelids, which gave him a perpetually sleepy expression. No matter how many times he was arrested and thrown in the City Workhouse, Skippy Rohan was known as the wildest crook in the Kerry Patch. In 1892, two St. Louis detectives caught Rohan in a \"stick-up\". Skippy drew his revolver and shot one before he could react. The other detective was pistol-whipped so hard his skull was fractured. Rohan was only caught when a uniformed patrolman happened upon the scene and shot Skippy in the leg.\nBy 1896, Skippy Rohan was associated with the Ashley Street Gang (the embryonic Egan's Rats). Most of the Ashley Street boys were just sneak thieves at this time and were awed to be hooked up with a notorious crook like Skippy Rohan, who took a primary position in the fledgling gang. He grew especially close to gangster Tom Egan. On June 16, 1897, Skippy Rohan was accused of shooting and killing a saloonkeeper named Casper Biemfohr during a robbery gone bad. Skippy and his pals had been on a crime spree that week, and the police set out to find the young thug. Skippy took refuge in \"The Rookery\", a large tenement at Fifteenth and O'Fallon streets that was crowded with refugees, criminals, and garbage. The cops finally surprised him in the alley behind 1218 Fifteenth Street. Skippy fought for his life, gouging, swinging, and biting. Even his girlfriend, Alice Parsons, tried to fight the police. Skippy was finally pistol-whipped unconscious and hauled off to jail.\nSkippy's sister Catherine was married to a low-level member of the Ashley Street Gang named Carl Lohrman, who idolized his wild brother-in-law. While Skippy was locked up in the city jail, he was convinced that Lohrman was responsible for his arrest. On August 9, 1897, Carl Lohrman was lured to a meeting at Snake Kinney's saloon at Second and Carr with Tom Egan and John \"Guinea Mack\" McAuiliffe. As he left, Lohrman was stabbed to death at the corner of Sixth and Carr.\nDespite the murder of the suspected snitch, Skippy Rohan made plans to avoid the hangman's noose on his own. On August 30, 1897, Rohan escaped from the St. Louis Workhouse along with Buck O'Malley and \"Sport\" Heffernan. Rohan would later claim he bribed a jailer to gain access to materials that led to his break. After robbing a local saloon for funds, he and his fellow escapees fled to Chicago, where they were re-captured four months later. Skippy Rohan was ultimately acquitted of the murder of Casper Beimfohr on May 22, 1898. While he was sent to prison on unrelated robbery charges, Rohan declared that he had found the Lord and reformed.\nOver the next decade, Skippy Rohan would be in and out of prisons across the United States. He is known to have served time in New York's Sing Sing Prison. By 1914, Rohan had returned to his home town of St. Louis a broken down old thief. Years of hard living and prison time had taken their toll and Skippy Rohan truly aspired to go straight. Rohan married and obtained a job as a shoeworker. While he was away, his old gang, the Egan's Rats, had mushroomed into the most powerful criminal organization in the state of Missouri. His old pal, Tom Egan, was now looked upon as the crime boss of St. Louis. While Skippy frequently joined Egan for drinks at his saloon at Broadway and Carr streets, Rohan appears to have been serious about going legit. Skippy's life, however, would be changed by a chance encounter.\nAs a condition of his parole, Skippy Rohan would check in with St. Louis detectives at their headquarters at the corner of Twelfth and Clark streets. As he left one of these sessions in December 1915, Rohan ran into Egan gangster Harry \"Cherries\" Dunn, who mumbled a greeting and hurried away. It turned out that Dunn had visited the cops in order to offer to snitch on his fellow gang-mates in order to get his brother John sprung from an Illinois prison. As a result of this chance encounter, Cherries Dunn became paranoid that Tom Egan would find out about his disloyalty and kill him. As a result, Dunn was involved in at least two murders that month. It was later determined that his high-strung mental state resulted in him panicking and shooting in both cases. Skippy Rohan, now trying to live a normal life, was unfortunately oblivious to all this.\nOn the evening of January 7, 1916, Skippy Rohan and his friend August Hartmann attended a meeting for the shoemaker's union they belonged to. Afterwards, Rohan suggested they go have a few drinks in the old neighborhood. At 12:30 that morning, the two were in Tom Egan's saloon at Broadway and Carr. Even though it was a Friday night, the saloon was nearly empty. Egan's joint was a well-known gangster roost. The pair stood at the bar talking with bartender John Laker when Cherries Dunn suddenly barged in. Dunn told Laker to set the house up with drinks ... except for Rohan. Skippy growled, \"What's the matter with me?\" To which Dunn sneered, \"Go on, you snitch!\". Rohan stepped away from the bar, but before he could speak Dunn shot him squarely on the nose. Another bullet struck Rohan in the heart before he collapsed to the floor.\n",

While on parole for killing a woman in Missouri in 1969, Beardslee murdered two more women in California. He was sentenced to death and executed by lethal injection in San Quentin State Prison in 2005.\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri in 1943, Beardslee was the oldest of three children whose father died when he was 11. He was sent to a military school at age 15 and joined the U.S. Air Force at 19, where he served for four years as an aircraft mechanic. He and another airman were caught trying to steal a vehicle in 1965. He was sentenced to a work farm in Minnesota where he was hit by a falling tree and suffered a head fracture and a days-long coma.[1]\nIn 1969 in Missouri, he choked, stabbed and drowned Laura Griffin, whom he had just met. The two met in a bar, and, after drinking and dancing with her, Beardslee went home with her. He turned himself in and confessed to the killing. Beardslee pleaded guilty to second degree murder, received a 19-year sentence, and served seven years before being released on parole in 1977.[2] No motive was established nor did he offer any explanation.[3]\nFour years after leaving prison, while he was still on parole, Beardslee was arrested in California for the April 5, 1981, drug-related homicides of 19-year-old Patty Geddling and 23-year-old Stacie Benjamin in Redwood City, California. Prosecutors claim a drug deal between the friends of Beardslee's roommate had gone wrong, and a $185 drug debt had gone unpaid.[4] In a scheme devised by Frank Rutherford, a drug dealer, Beardslee's roommate, Ricarda Sue (Rickie) Soria, lured the two to their apartment. The prosecutors noted that Beardslee sent Soria out to get duct tape to bind the victims before they arrived. Beardslee and, according to the prosecution, Bill Forrester, both shot Geddling, and later Beardslee slashed Benjamin's throat.[5]\nBeardslee's phone number was found near Geddling's body and when police called he confessed and led them to Benjamin's body. At the time of this offense, he was still on parole for the 1969 Missouri killing which made him eligible for the death penalty as a repeat offender. Rutherford was sentenced to life without parole and died there in 2003. Soria pleaded no contest to second degree murder in exchange for testimony against Rutherford and Beardslee, and was sentenced to 15 years to life.[6] She was paroled in 2015.[7] Bill Forrester was acquitted and charges against a fifth person were dropped before trial. Beardslee was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.[8]\nThe defense tried to appeal on the grounds of inadequate defense since the original lawyer quit the case, and on grounds of mental defect due to a head injury from a falling tree in the Minnesota work farm accident when he was 21. Prosecutors noted that he was of above average intelligence although family members testified he had lifelong trouble expressing emotion and prison records indicate diagnoses of schizophrenia.\nBeardslee was executed on January 19, 2005. He was the first prisoner to be executed in California since Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger took office.[9] Beardslee had no final words.[10] Schwarzenegger denied clemency to Beardslee, stating that \"we are not dealing here with a man who is so generally affected by his impairment that he cannot tell the difference between right and wrong.\"\n",

In 2005, he admitted responsibility for five homicides in Missouri as part of a plea bargain to receive multiple life sentences without possibility of parole and avoid more death sentences. Investigators suspect that more victims remain undiscovered.[1]\nBecause he made contact with most of his post-1993 victims via online chatrooms, Robinson is sometimes referred to as \"the Internet's first serial killer\".[2]\nJohn Robinson was born in Cicero, Illinois, the third of five children of an alcoholic father and a disciplinarian mother.[2]:\u200a4\u200a In 1957, Robinson became an Eagle Scout and traveled to London with a group of Scouts who performed before Queen Elizabeth II. He enrolled at Quigley Preparatory Seminary in Chicago, a private boys school for aspiring priests, but dropped out after one year due to disciplinary issues.[3][4]\nIn 1961, Robinson enrolled at Morton Junior College in Cicero to become a medical radiographer, but dropped out after two years. In 1964, he moved to Kansas City and married Nancy Jo Lynch, who gave birth to their first child, John Jr., in 1965, followed by daughter Kimberly in 1967, and twins Christopher and Christine in 1971.\nIn 1969, Robinson was arrested in Kansas City for embezzling $33,000 from the medical practice of Dr. Wallace Graham, where he worked as a radiographer using forged credentials. He was sentenced to three years probation.[3] The following year, he violated probation by moving to Chicago without his probation officer's permission and gained a job as an insurance salesman at the R.B. Jones Company. In 1971, he was arrested for embezzling funds and was ordered back to Kansas City, where his probation was extended. In 1975, Robinson's probation was extended again after an arrest on charges of securities fraud and mail fraud in connection with a phony medical consulting company he had formed.\nRobinson became a Scoutmaster, a baseball coach, and a Sunday school teacher. In 1977, he was named to the board of directors of a local charitable organization where he forged letters from its executive director to the mayor of Kansas City and from the mayor to civic leaders, naming him as the organization's Man of the Year. Under that guise, he hosted an awards luncheon in his honor.[3]\nAfter completing his probation In 1979, Robinson was arrested for embezzlement and check forgery, for which he served sixty days in jail in 1982. After his release, he formed a bogus hydroponics business and stole $25,000 from a friend to whom he promised a fast investment return so the friend could pay for his dying wife's health care.[2]:\u200a4\u200a\nIn 1984, having established two more fraudulent shell companies (Equi-Plus and Equi-2), Robinson hired Paula Godfrey, aged 19, ostensibly to work as a sales representative. Godfrey told friends and family that Robinson was sending her away for training. After hearing nothing further from her, Godfrey's parents filed a missing persons report. Police questioned Robinson, who denied any knowledge of her whereabouts. Several days later, her parents received a typewritten letter, with Godfrey's signature at the bottom, thanking Robinson for his help and asserting that she was \"OK\" and did not want to see her family. The investigation was terminated as Godfrey was of legal age, and there was no evidence of wrongdoing. No trace of Godfrey has ever been found.[2]\nIn 1985, using the name John Osborne, Robinson met Lisa Stasi and her four-month-old daughter, Tiffany, at a women's shelter in Kansas City. He promised Stasi a job in Chicago, an apartment, and daycare for her infant and asked her to sign several sheets of blank stationery. A few days later, he contacted his brother Don and sister-in-law, Helen, who had been unable to adopt a baby through traditional channels, and informed them that he knew of a baby whose mother had committed suicide. For $5,500 in \"legal fees\", the couple received Tiffany (whose identity was confirmed by DNA testing in 2000[5]) and a set of authentic-appearing adoption papers with the forged signatures of two lawyers and a judge. Stasi was never heard from again.[2]:\u200a4\u200a\n",

She was publicly hanged by Sheriff Shubael Allen the following month, at the county seat of Liberty.[2] Hers was the first legal execution in Clay County (established 1822),[3] and she is the first enslaved woman known to have been executed in Missouri.[2]\nOne author has suggested that by killing the children Annice was \"depriving her owner of no fewer than five potentially valuable properties\", thus striking out against \"the curse of involuntary servitude\".[2] Annice is the only slave known to have been executed for infanticide in Missouri, but a number of other instances have been found in other states. Enslaved women believed that by killing their children they were sparing them a lifetime of subjugation.[1] There has been some speculation that Annice was the mother of another female slave of the same name, who was lynched in Clay County in 1850 for the attempted murder of her owner. However, there is no direct evidence linking the two other than their shared names and location.[4] In 1976, Clay County erected a memorial plaque at Tryst Falls (near Excelsior Springs), identifying it as the location of the drownings. The plaque was modified a few decades later to remove the specific details of Annice's actions.[2]\n",

While the spelling \"Haun\" is common when referring to the massacre or the mill where it occurred, the mill's owner used the spelling \"Hawn\" in legal documents.[2]\nHawn's Mill was a mill established on the banks of Shoal Creek in Fairview Township, Caldwell County, Missouri in 1835\u20131836 by Jacob Hawn.[3] Hawn was the son of German emigrants to Canada, who resettled in New York, where Jacob was born. While Jacob moved to Missouri and founded the mill around the same time as the Mormon migration to Missouri, he was not a Mormon.[2][4] However, by October 1838 there were approximately 75 Mormon families living along the banks of Shoal Creek, about 30[5][6][7] of them in the immediate vicinity of Hawn's Mill and the James Houston blacksmith shop.[8]\nThe unauthorized militia[9]:\u200a151\u200a involved in the massacre was led overall by Colonel Thomas Jennings, of Livingston County with  William O. Jennings (Sheriff of Livingston County), Nehemiah Comstock, and William Gee as captains of the three companies.

Bryan, Clerk of Livingston County.[11][10][9]\nAlthough the massacre took place a few days after Missouri's governor, Lilburn Boggs, issued his infamous Missouri Executive Order 44 (\"Extermination Order\" of 1838) there is debate if the participants in the massacre knew of it. Hyrum Smith reported in the church's archives that Captain Comstock, who previously had assured the Mormons at the mill of their safety, had returned the next day attacking them, saying he had received an order from Governor Boggs via Colonel Ashley.[9]:\u200a156\u200a However, historian William G. Hartley opined the local militia likely had not yet received news of this specific executive order, but rather the militia responded to the open hostility to Mormons that was already prevalent in Missouri, even before the order was published.[12]\nMilitia member and state legislator Major Daniel Ashby[13] stated in the Missouri House of Representatives that reports from Mormon dissenters led to the attack of Hawn's Mill.[14] Those Hawn's Mill settlement dissenters were Robert White, George Miller, and Sardis Smith.[6][15][16][17][18]\nShortly before the massacre, anti-Mormon raiders confiscated gun and weapons from Mormon settlers and immigrants.[9] Some of those living in the surrounding area gathered at Hawn's Mill for safety.\nThe threat posed by the growing strength and animosity of the Missouri militia caused considerable concern among the Mormon settlers at Hawn's Mill.  They held a council on Sunday, October 28 and decided to organize a defensive force. Thirty-six men[19] were armed and held in readiness against an attack.  During the council meeting, a delayed group of about ten Mormon emigrant families from Kirtland Camp arrived at the settlement and camped near the blacksmith shop.[10][20] That evening, one of the militia groups sent a representative who negotiated a truce with the settlers.  Monday the 29th and most of Tuesday the 30th passed without incident.[21]\nOn October 30 at approximately 4 p.m., the militia rode into the community.  David Evans, a leader in the community, ran towards the militia, waving his hat and calling for peace.  Alerted to the militia's approach, most of the Latter-day Saint women and children fled into the woods to the south, while most of the men headed to the blacksmith shop.  The building was a particularly vulnerable structure as the widely-spaced logs enabled the attackers to fire inside.  The shop became a deathtrap, since the militia gave no quarter, discharging about 100 rifles into the building.[10] Grand River Township Justice of the Peace Thomas McBride, wounded while escaping the blacksmith shop, surrendered his gun to Jacob S Rogers Jr. who shot him, then hacked his body with a corn knife (scythe blade).  According to their own account, they fired seven rounds making upwards of 1,600 shots during the attack of Hawn's Mill.[22] The attack lasted 30 to 60 minutes.[23]\n",

They then moved to the Vallejo area. He would often frequent the Country Club Crest neighborhood, known locally as The Crest. In 1989, the outgoing Hicks made waves with a cassette tape featuring the single, \"Too Hard for the F---in' Radio\" while still a student at Vallejo's Hogan High School. In 2013 NPR noted his sound as being \"fast and confident\" further writing that \"he built upon the bouncy bass that had its roots in the funk era.\"[6] When asked about his childhood, Hicks stated that \"Situations came out for the better most of them, I went through the little trials and the shit that I went through.\"[7][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Hicks first adopted the stage name MC Dre in 1984, but altered it to Mac Dre the following year because he considered that the name sounded \"too East Coast-ish\".[8][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] Hicks recorded his first three EPs as Mac Dre between 1988 and 1992.[9]\nThe city of Vallejo began experiencing a surge in bank robberies in the early 90s.[10] Vallejo police began focusing on the Crest Neighborhood as a source of the crime. Hicks was vocal about the actions he saw being taken by the police and incorporated their aggressive surveillance of residents into his music. Hicks claimed he was rapping about attempts to \"wake up the neighbors.\"[11] As gangster rap music consistently grew in popularity, law enforcement officials began examining the lyrics of local rappers to utilize as evidence in criminal matters.[12]\nOn March 26, 1992, at age 21, Hicks was invited by friends to a road trip to Fresno. Hicks had performed in that city two weeks prior and decided to go on the trip so that he could re-visit a woman he knew there. While driving back to Vallejo, the car was surrounded by the FBI, Fresno, and Vallejo police. The police verbalized that while Hicks was at a motel, his friends were allegedly casing a bank but had changed their mind when they saw a local Fresno TV News van in the bank's parking lot.[13]\nWhen questioned by the police, Hicks verbalized that he didn't leave the hotel, therefore did not know anything. The police subsequently charged him with conspiracy to commit robbery, although no bank robbery was conducted and Hicks was neither with his friends nor near the location of the purported bank.[14]\nHe was sentenced to five years in federal prison after he refused a plea deal for the conspiracy charge.[15] The trial was later listed among Complex Magazine's 30 Biggest Criminal Trials in Rap History.[16] At the time of his conviction, Hicks owned the record label Romp Productions.[9] Hicks was released a year early from prison for good behavior on August 2, 1996, after serving four years.[9] It was during his time in prison that Hicks developed a \"better appreciation for freedom, life, fun.\"[17]\nAfter his release from Lompoc Prison,[18] Mac Dre and longtime collaborator Coolio Da' Unda Dogg (Troy Reddick) recorded tracks to pitch to major record labels. One song was sent to representatives of fellow Bay Area rapper Too Short for an upcoming compilation, Nationwide: Independence Day, but was not selected.[citation needed]\nMac Dre moved to the Arden-Arcade area of Sacramento in 1998 in attempt to distance himself from Vallejo law enforcement. There, he founded his independent label Thizz Entertainment, which is currently managed by his mother Wanda Salvatto.[17] In the early 2000s, Dre's change in sound became influential in the hyphy movement.[17]\nAtlanta rapper and producer Lil Jon, with Salvatto's blessing, incorporated Dre's vocals into his 2019 single \"Ain't No Tellin\".[19]\n",

        "paragraph": "Charles Gargotta, also known as \"Mad Dog\", (1900\u20131950) was a Kansas City, Missouri, gangster who became a top enforcer for the Kansas City crime family.\nBorn in Kansas City, Gargotta joined the criminal organization of boss John Lazia as a young man. Gargotta and his close associate, Charles Binaggio built a gambling ring that grossed as much as $34,500,000 a year on dice and card games, numbers racket, and bookmaking. Gargotta was arrested more than 40 times over a 30-year period for murder, illegal gambling, liquor law violations, carrying a concealed weapon, robbery, auto theft, extortion, attempted burglary, and vagrancy. However, due to Gargotta's political influence, all of these charges were eventually dropped.\nIn 1933, Lazia's control over organized crime in Kansas City was challenged by Joe Lusco and Ferris Anthon, two other Kansas City mobsters. Lazia tasked Gargotta and several other mob associates to kill Anthon. On August 12, 1933, the gunmen shot Anthon as he was entering his apartment building in Kansas City.  However, County Sheriff Tom Bash and Sheriff Deputy Lawrence Hodges came upon the scene, and opened fire. Two of Lazia's men were killed and one escaped. During the firefight, Gargotta leaped from the car, emptied a Colt .45 automatic at Bash, and then surrendered, yelling, \"Don't shoot me \u2013 Don\u2019t shoot me!\"\nIn 1935, Gargotta was indicted for the 1933 attempted murder of Bash. However, Gargotta had strong allies in the law enforcement and legal community. The court granted 29 continuances before the case finally came to trial. Kansas City police officers switched the evidence tags on several guns recovered at the scene so as to shed doubt on the question of who held the murder weapon.  Testimony of sheriff Bash and a ballistics expert placed the murder weapon securely in Gargotta's hands, but the jury had been bribed. Gargotta was acquitted of the homicide charge and convicted of the illegal possession of a gun, sentenced to a minimum term, and released promptly. Eventually, over the protest of the police department, the Governor of Missouri pardoned Gargotta.  The police officer who changed the evidence tags was eventually convicted of perjury and sent to jail.\nOn April 5, 1950, Binaggio and Gargotta drove to the Jackson County, Missouri Democratic Club in Kansas City to meet a trusted associate. A taxi driver later discovered the bodies in the club, each with four bullet wounds to the head. Gargotta was sprawled on the floor near the door, under a large portrait of then-president Harry S. Truman. In February 1950, Gargotta had testified before a federal grand jury in Kansas City about his criminal activities. Underworld outrage over Gargotta's testimony may have led to his assassination. Another theory is that the Mafia Commission in New York ordered Binaggio's murder because he had failed to keep promises to the Commission. The two murders were never solved.\nHowever, the high-profile murders of Gargotta and Binaggio, along with their subversion of the criminal justice system, created public pressure on President Harry Truman to support a congressional investigation into organized crime.  This resulted in the famous Kefauver Commission hearings in the U.S. Senate, named after Senator Estes Kefauver. During these hearings, Kefauver made the following observation:\nIf ever a human being deserved the title of \"Mad Dog\" it was Gargotta.",

Grinder (1945\u20132010) was an American serial killer and rapist who murdered three teenage girls in Arkansas and a woman in Missouri between 1976 and 1984.[1] Grinder wasn't apprehended until his confession in March 1998. However, authorities still had little evidence tying Grinder to the murders, so they used a technique known as brain fingerprinting to help prove his guilt. In 1999, Grinder was convicted of the four murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. He remained imprisoned until his death in 2010.[2]\nJames B. Grinder was born in 1945.[1] In 1980, Grinder had a daughter, but he and his child's mother split-up soon afterward. He later moved to Macon County, Missouri.[2]\nOn December 2, 1976, Grinder picked up Teresa Williams, 13, Crystal Donita Parton, 14, and Cynthia Mabry, 13, outside Russellville, Arkansas. According to Grinder, the three girls voluntary got into his car after he offered to buy them alcohol. After purchasing alcohol in Morrilton, he drove them to Brock Cemetery where he raped Williams and Parton. He then strangled them and stabbed them in the neck before hiding their bodies under some brush off a nearby dead-end road. He then took Mabry, who was still alive, into a forest and raped her. Grinder then attempted to bludgeon her to death with a soda bottle. However, Mabry was still alive, so he beat her to death with a tire iron.[3]\nAccording to Grinder's then girlfriend, he came home at about midnight. He told her about the missing girls and asked her to say that he'd been with her all night if anyone asked. Grinder also gave her $200. About a week after the murders, Grinder returned to the cemetery to cover Williams and Parton's remains with more brush.[3]\nGrinder soon became a suspect in the disappearances after Teresa Williams' cousin told police he saw Grinder with Williams that day. Grinder told investigators that he saw the girls hitchhiking and pick them up, but he dropped them off at the interstate exit for Pottsville. Since the victims' remains had not yet been found, and Grinder had an alibi, police assumed the girls were runaways.[3]\nThe skeletal remains of Teresa Williams and Crystal Parton were found by a deer hunter in 1986. Cynthia Mabry's body has never been found.[3]\nOn the early morning of January 8, 1984, the car of Julianne Helton, 25, was found by Missouri State Highway Patrol at the Marceline junction in Macon County, Missouri. Helton's parents filed a missing persons report after she failed to come home from a party in New Cambria the night before. Investigators immediately suspected foul play in her death, noting her car had been sabotaged. A search party was soon assembled, and they searched for her in Macon and Linn counties. On January 11, 1984, two volunteer searchers and railroad workers found Helton's fully-clothed body in a field near tracks of the Santa Fe railroad \u2013 eight miles northwest of where her car had been found. She had been raped, beaten, and stabbed to death by Grinder. Her hands were also bound in front with baling twine and her right hand showed defensive wounds. Helton's purse and the weapon used to stab her were missing.[3]\nIn March 1998, Grinder and two others were arrested for burglary. Grinder had long been a suspect in Julianne Helton's murder, but police couldn't find enough evidence to arrest him. After his arrest for burglary, police offered him a plea deal for life in prison, so he confessed. Upon hearing that Grinder confessed to Helton's murder, Russellville police traveled to Macon County to question him about the murders of Teresa Williams, Crystal Parton, and Cynthia Mabry. Grinder also confessed to these murders, proving details only the perpetrator would know.[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Bridge Murder case, also known as the Bridge Table Murder case, was the trial of Myrtle Adkins Bennett (born March 20, 1895, in Tillar, Arkansas), a Kansas City housewife, for the murder of her husband John G. Bennett over a game of contract bridge in September 1929.[1]\nMyrtle and John spent much of Sunday, September 29, 1929, with their upstairs neighbors, Charles and Myrna Hofman.[1] The husbands played a round of golf at the Indian Hills Country Club that morning, and then went back to the links that afternoon with their wives joining them. At dusk, they returned to the Bennett apartment at 902 Ward Parkway in the Country Club District of Kansas City. After sharing dinner, they sat down to a game of bridge in the Bennett living room, the couples playing as partners, the Hofmans versus the Bennetts. After midnight, as the Hofmans began to pull ahead, the Bennetts began to bicker. In the ultimate hand, John failed to make his four spades contract and Myrtle, frustrated by the failure, called him \"a bum bridge player\". He stood and slapped her in the face several times, and announced he was leaving.[2] He said he would spend the night in a motel in Saint Joseph, Missouri. As he packed his bag, and moved from room to room, he mocked his wife. Myrtle told the Hofmans, \"Only a cur would strike a woman in front of guests.\"[3]\nAfter an ongoing argument, John Bennett went to pack a suitcase as he told Myrtle to retrieve the handgun he typically carried on the road for protection. Myrtle walked down the hall to the bedroom of her mother, Alice Adkins. Still sobbing, Myrtle reached into a drawer with linens and pulled out his .32 Colt semi automatic, and walked into the den. There, she brushed past Charles Hofman, and shot at John's back twice in the bathroom of the apartment. John escaped into the hallway, but fell to the floor in their living room.\nMyrtle Bennett was tried by Judge Ralph S. Latshaw. The trial began on February 23, 1931, and lasted eleven days. Her defence was James A. Reed, former three-term U.S. Senator and onetime Democratic presidential candidate. Reed showed jurors that John Bennett had been previously violent and abusive, and attempted to explain that Mrs Bennett was either insane or acted in self-defence. The judge disallowed the prosecution, James R. Page, to submit John Bennett's nephew Byrd Rice, as he was not on the original list of witnesses. After an eight-hour deliberation, the jury returned a not guilty verdict.[1][4] The prosecution's assistant, John Hill, said, \"It looks like an open season on husbands.\"[5]\nThe case caught the public imagination, and was subject to press attention by the New York Journal, not for the trial itself, but for the bridge game. The case was a media sensation and a flashpoint in the bridge craze sweeping the nation. The Journal invited speculation from bridge experts, including Sidney Lenz, on the game, what hands had been played, and whether different play, or alternative hands, would have prevented the murder.[6] None of the people present in the apartment at the time later recalled exactly what the hands were.[6] When the case came to trial, Myrtle Bennett was defended by former U.S. Senator James A. Reed.[1]\nEly Culbertson, the Barnum of the bridge movement, watched the trial closely from New York. Culbertson used the Bennett tragedy to his advantage. He sold bridge and himself, telling housewives that the game was a great way to defuse the marital tensions pent-up in daily life. He told housewives that, at the bridge table, they could be their husbands' equal, and more.\nCulbertson wrote about the killing and trial in his new magazine, The Bridge World.[7]  In packed halls on the lecture circuit, he analyzed the so-called \"Fatal Hand\" \u2013 even as he knew the details were fabricated. In lectures, Culbertson suggested that if only the Bennetts had been playing the Culbertson System of bidding, then 36-year-old John Bennett might still have been alive.[8]\nOnly 35 years old at the time of her acquittal, Myrtle Bennett lived for another 61 years, dying at the age of 96 in Miami, Florida, in January 1992. She had moved into obscurity soon after the trial, her name fading from headlines. She never remarried, nor did she have children. After World War II and throughout the 1950s, she worked as executive head of housekeeping at the elegant Hotel Carlyle in New York City, living alone there in an apartment.[9] At the Carlyle, she developed friendships with the rich and famous, including the actors Mary Pickford and her husband Buddy Rogers, and also Henry Ford II.\nThe widow Bennett later traveled the world, working for a hotel chain, and played bridge until nearly the end of her life. In an interview with the author Gary Pomerantz,[9] Myrtle Bennett's cousin, Carolyn Scruggs of Arkansas, said that Mrs. Bennett never spoke with her about the shooting. Once, though, Ms. Scruggs told Mrs. Bennett, \"I sometimes think of your life \u2013\" But Myrtle Bennett interrupted, and said, \"Well, my dear, it was a great tragedy and a great mistake.\" Scruggs stammered to say, \"I guess I want you to know that I understand it.\" But Myrtle Bennett said, \"No, my dear, you don't understand it.\"[citation needed]\n",

Sentenced to death for his sole conviction, LaRette was executed in 1995.[1]\nIn August 1976, LaRette, posing as one \"Mike Watson\", registered in two separate motels while staying in Marathon, Florida.[2] On August 20, he broke into the home of 26-year-old Jeanette \"Mickey\" Wade, who had just returned from work.[3] After realizing she had come back, he confronted the woman in the kitchen and stabbed her multiple times before finally cutting her throat.[3] LaRette then left the scene and hitchhiked out of the city, and despite a witness providing a description of the supposed assailant, he was not caught.[2]\nThree days later, now in St. Petersburg, he noticed 52-year-old Betty H. Brunton, an employee at the Memorial Park Cemetery who was returning home to get her lunch. LaRette stalked her to her house, went inside and stabbed her to death with a knife, leaving the weapon stuck in her stomach.[4] The body was later discovered by co-workers who had become concerned that she had not gone to lunch with them and called the ambulance, initially believing that she had fallen ill with some sort of sickness.[5] An ambulance was dispatched to the house and went in, but the attendants pronounced that she was dead at the scene. Officials noted there were no apparent signs of a break-in or struggle.[5] In 1979, The Tampa Tribune published an article in which they speculated that Brunton\u2019s murder could have been the doing of John Benjamin Kennedy, an inmate serving a life sentence for an unrelated murder in Oklahoma, but no definitive connection was established.[6]\nOn December 7, 1977, LaRette was in Kansas City, Missouri when he came across 24-year-old Beverly Wortmann, a reporter and photographer who was returning to her apartment after going out to buy cigarettes.[7] After stalking her to the apartment, he went inside and stabbed her 19 times before finally slashing her throat and leaving afterwards.[8] Upon discovery of the crime, a 24-year-old man, who had been reading the Bible in front of Wortmann's apartment, was arrested and queried in her death, as well two other recent ones that had occurred in the city.[9] The unnamed man vehemently denied any involvement in any of the crimes, and as nothing connected him to the killings, he was subsequently released without charges.[10]\nOn May 20, 1978, 60-year-old Helen Alderson Hall, whose family was prominent in Greyhound racing, was found murdered in her St. Petersburg home by her son, Richard.[11] Upon examining the crime scene, the authorities concluded that she had been bludgeoned to death with an unknown object in her bedroom by her assailant.[12] However, they were unable to determine a concrete motive, as there was no sign of forced entry.[11] Her 1971 light-green Lincoln Continental was missing, and it was supposed that it was stolen by her killer.[12] At the time, while the sheriffs continued to investigate her murder, they were unable to find any potential suspects.[13]\nOn November 2, 1978, a secretary for a law firm based in Manhattan, Kansas went to the home of 26-year-old Tracey Gladys Miller to check on her as she had not attended lunch with her colleagues. She found Miller's body on the stairway. After notifying her neighbor, both women called an ambulance.[14] At the hospital, it was determined that the victim had been stabbed multiple times and her throat had been slashed.[15] As part of their investigation, police combed the wooded area around the house, but were unable to find any substantial clues to point towards the killer. A secret witness program was established by police in an attempt to gather clues, but this proved to be futile, as none led to any arrests.[16]\nOn July 25, 1980, LaRette had arrived in St. Charles, Missouri, when he happened upon 18-year-old Mary Fleming, who was returning to her parents' apartment from grocery shopping at the nearby Hedges & Hafer supermarket.[17] After following her to the apartment and making sure she was alone, he crept inside and attacked Fleming, ripping off her clothes in an attempted rape. LaRette stabbed her twice in the chest and slashed her throat before fleeing through the front door. Fleming, clad only in a bikini top, ran to the home of a neighbor before collapsing. An ambulance was called and she was taken to the St. Joseph Hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries.[18]\nInvestigation at first proved difficult, as there was no apparent motive to the attack.[17] Initially, it was suggested that Fleming's death might be related to other recent crimes in the area, but these possibilities were later ruled out.[17] Two days later, an autopsy report confirmed that Fleming had not been sexually assaulted, and on the same day, police released a sketch of a possible witness, complete with details of his appearance and his vehicle.[19]\nAlmost a week later, the man depicted in the sketch was identified as LaRette, who was reportedly visiting some friends in St. Charles who lived in the same area as Fleming.[20] An arrest warrant charging him with murder was subsequently issued. Missouri police sent sheriffs to arrest him at his permanent address in Topeka, Kansas.[21] However, he had fled the area, causing authorities from both states to ask the FBI for assistance in case of a possible manhunt.[22] A day later, LaRette was found at his sister's house, and he attempted to commit suicide by slashing his neck and one of his wrists.[23] His injuries proved to be minor, and he was taken into custody.[23]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nArchie Clement (January 1, 1846 \u2013 December 13, 1866), also known as \"Little Arch\" or \"Little Archie\", was an American pro-Confederate guerrilla leader during the American Civil War, known for his brutality towards Union soldiers and pro-Union civilians in the state of Missouri.\nClement was born in Stokes County, North Carolina and brought to Missouri with his family as a toddler.[1] By the beginning of the American Civil War, he and his family were recorded as living in Big Creek Township, Cass County, Missouri.[2] A Confederate \"bushwhacker\" or guerrilla during the Civil War, Clement rose to notoriety in 1864 as a lieutenant of William \"Bloody Bill\" Anderson. Clement soon became known as Anderson's most trusted follower\u2014or, in the words of an enemy, \"Bill Anderson's scalper and head devil.\" Standing just over 5\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (1.52\u00a0m) tall and weighing about 130 pounds (59\u00a0kg), Clement's youth and slight stature belied his ferocity. Anderson (or one of his men) left this note on the body of a dead Unionist after a particularly vicious skirmish: \"You come to hunt bush whackers. Now you are skelpt. Clemyent skelpt you. Wm. Anderson.\"[3]\nClement took a prominent role in all of the major operations of Anderson's organization in 1864, including the Centralia Massacre, in which the guerrillas blocked the tracks of the Northern Missouri Railroad and forced a train to stop. They then robbed the civilian passengers and killed 22 unarmed Union soldiers found on board, who had been returning home on furlough from the Atlanta campaign. Anderson left one Union sergeant alive for a possible prisoner exchange. The guerrillas shot the rest, and scalped and otherwise mutilated the corpses.[4]\nFollowing Anderson's death in an ambush by Union militia on October 27, 1864, Clement took command, continuing to fight into the next year. Following the surrender of General Robert E. Lee's army in Virginia, Clement's band of guerrillas persisted, even demanding the surrender of the town of Lexington, Missouri. Though some comrades, including Dave Poole, surrendered, Clement and Jesse James remained under arms. On May 15, 1865, Clement and James encountered a Union cavalry patrol; a skirmish ensued in which James was severely wounded.[5]\nBeginning in 1866, Clement and his supporters turned to bank robbery, especially of banks associated with Missouri Unionists. On February 13, a group of gunmen carried out the first daylight, peacetime, armed bank robbery in U.S. history when they held up the Clay County Savings Association in Liberty, Missouri, stealing more than $58,000 in cash and bonds. The bank was owned and operated by former Union militia officers, who recently had conducted the first Republican Party rally in Clay County's history. The state authorities suspected Clement of leading the raid and offered a reward for his capture. In later years, the list of suspects would grow to include Frank James, Cole Younger, John Jarrette, Oliver Shepard, Bud and Donny Pence, Frank Gregg, Bill and James Wilkerson, Joab Perry, Ben Cooper, Red Mankus and Allen Parmer. During the escape through the streets of Liberty, one of the gang shot dead innocent bystander George Wymore.[6] A string of robberies followed, many linked to Clement's gang. The hold-up most clearly linked to them was of Alexander Mitchell and Company in Lexington, Missouri, on October 30, 1866, in which they stole $2,000.\nAs the pivotal election of 1866 approached, political violence flared across Missouri. Much of it was associated with Clement, who harassed the Republican authorities who governed Missouri. On election day in November, Clement led a group of some 100 former bushwhackers into Lexington. Their gunfire and intimidation led to the defeat of the Republican Party in the election. In response, Governor Thomas C. Fletcher dispatched a platoon of state militia, led by Major Bacon Montgomery. Clement withdrew, only to return on December 13. Seeking to avoid a major battle in the center of town, Montgomery allowed Clement to enroll his men in the state militia.\nAfter the bushwhackers left, Clement went to the bar of the City Hotel for a drink. Montgomery dispatched men to the hotel with a warrant for the Liberty robbery. The major's men found Clement drinking with an old friend and called out for him to surrender. Clement drew his revolvers and a wild gunfight ensued. Despite having sustained a gunshot wound to the chest, he escaped on his horse only to be shot by a militia detachment stationed at the courthouse. Montgomery and his men approached Clement, who, though mortally wounded, was trying to cock his revolver with his teeth. One of the soldiers asked, \"Arch, you are dying. What do you want me to do with you?\" Clement replied, \"I've done what I always said I would do ... die before I'd surrender.\" Montgomery later stated of Clement's final moments, \"I've never met better 'grit' on the face of the earth.\"[7]\nAfter Clement's death, his organization continued to rob while being pursued by government troops. Out of this group rose Jesse James, who would achieve notoriety three years later. Clement is buried in the Arnold Cemetery near Napoleon, Missouri.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn October 24, 2022, a mass shooting occurred at Central Visual and Performing Arts High School in the Southwest Garden section of St. Louis, Missouri, United States. Three people were killed, including the perpetrator, and an additional seven were injured.[3] Authorities identified 19-year-old former student Orlando Harris as the perpetrator.[4]\nCentral Visual and Performing Arts High School uses the code word \"Miles Davis is in the building\" to alert students and staff of an active shooter in the building.[3] The school also has several metal detectors, and seven security guards were present on the day of the shooting.[3][5]\nMissouri does not have a red flag law which permits a state court to order the temporary removal of firearms from a person who they believe may present a danger to others or themselves.[6][7]\nOn October 24, 2022, shortly before the incident, Harris parked his blue 2012 Dodge Avenger near the building before entering the school via a side entryway, walking up to the third floor. Harris was armed with an AR-15 style rifle, more than 600 rounds of ammunition, and about a dozen 30-round magazines. Wearing all black clothing, Harris forcibly made entry by shooting a glass door before opening fire inside the school on the fourth floor.[1][2][3][8] At 9:11 a.m., police received the first call regarding an active shooter threat at the school.[9] School security officers were credited with identifying Harris's intentions and warning others to allow for authorities to be notified.[10]\nOne witness said Harris shot the windows of his classroom out, then shouted \"You're all going to fucking die\" before he attempted to enter their room. At one point, Harris entered a dance class intent on opening fire, but his firearm malfunctioned, allowing occupants to escape. Evacuating students and staff were questioned by responding officers to pinpoint where Harris was located and also followed the sounds of gunfire.[10] Police entered the building at 9:15 a.m., ordered Harris to put his hands up, and subsequently exchanged gunfire with him eight minutes later. After a brief shootout, at 9:25 a.m., Harris was struck and killed. No officers were injured.[11]\nDuring the shooting, students attending Collegiate School of Medicine and Bioscience, which shares the building with Central Visual and Performing Arts High School, were placed under lockdown.[12] Students were evacuated to the nearby Gateway STEM High School.[8]\nTwo people were killed by the gunman: 15-year-old sophomore Alexzandria Bell, who was pronounced dead on the scene, and 61-year-old physical education teacher Jean Kuczka, who died at a hospital.[13] In addition to the fatalities, seven people were injured, four from gunshots and three from physical injuries caused by the ensuing chaos and evacuation. One injured victim was shot twice and jumped out a second-story window, breaking his ankle.[14][15]\nSt. Louis police and federal authorities from the FBI and ATF worked together to search both the school, home and car of the perpetrator to identify a motive. The FBI created a digital evidence collection website where they have asked anyone with photos, video, audio or any other evidence to upload it to aid in the investigation.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Kansas City massacre was the shootout and murder of four law enforcement officers and a criminal fugitive at the Union Station railroad depot in Kansas City, Missouri, on the morning of June 17, 1933.  It occurred as part of the attempt by a gang led by Vernon C. \"Verne\" Miller to free Frank \"Jelly\" Nash, a federal prisoner. At the time, Nash was in the custody of several law enforcement officers who were returning him to the U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, from which he had escaped three years earlier.\nCharles \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd was identified by the FBI as one of the gunmen.  However, there is evidence to suggest that Floyd was not involved.[1]\nFrank Nash was first convicted in 1913. He and a friend, Nollie \"Humpy\" Wortman, stole nearly $1,000 from a store in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. While escaping, Nash suggested they hide the evidence. As Wortman went to bury the money, Nash shot him in the back. Nash was arrested hours later and sentenced to life in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. On March 28, 1918, Nash's sentence was reduced to ten years after he convinced the warden he wanted to join the army and fight in World War I. In 1920, Nash was convicted of burglary using explosives, also known as safe-cracking, and sentenced to 25 years in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. He became a trusty, and his sentence was reduced to five years. On December 29, 1922, Nash was released. On March 3, 1924, Nash began a 25-year sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, in Kansas, for assaulting a mail custodian. He escaped on October 19, 1930.\nThe FBI launched an intensive search for Nash throughout the entire United States and most of Canada. After an intensive investigation, the FBI concluded that Nash had assisted in the escape of seven prisoners from the United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, on December 11, 1931.\nThe investigation also disclosed that Nash had a very close association with Francis L. Keating, Thomas Holden, and several other gunmen who had participated in a number of bank robberies throughout the Midwest. Keating and Holden were apprehended by FBI agents on July 7, 1932, in Kansas City, Missouri. The pair had crucial information about the whereabouts of Nash and eventually divulged that he was hiding out in Hot Springs, Arkansas.\nWith information in hand, two FBI agents, Frank Smith and Francis Joseph \"Joe\" Lackey, and McAlester, Oklahoma Police Chief Otto Reed ventured to Arkansas to find the escaped outlaw.  After an exhaustive search, Nash was apprehended in a local store in Hot Springs on June 16, 1933. The three officials then drove Nash to Fort Smith, Arkansas, to board a train bound for Kansas City, Missouri, at 8:30 that night.  The Missouri Pacific train's estimated time of arrival in Kansas City was 7:15 the next morning. Before traveling, the lawmen contacted Reed E. Vetterli, Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the FBI's Kansas City office, to meet them at the train station upon arrival.\nA number of outlaw friends of Nash had heard of his capture in Hot Springs. They learned the time of the scheduled arrival of Nash and his captors in Kansas City and made plans to free him. The scheme was conceived and engineered by Richard Tallman Galatas, Herbert Farmer, \"Doc\" Louis Stacci, and Frank B. Mulloy. Vernon Miller was designated to free Nash, and while at Mulloy's tavern in Kansas City, he made a number of phone calls for assistance in the scheme.  According to the official FBI report, Charles \"Pretty Boy\" Floyd and his sidekick Adam Richetti arrived in Kansas City to aid in the mission.\nAccording to the FBI report, Floyd and Richetti happened to be on the way to Kansas City but had been detained at Bolivar, Missouri, early on the morning of the 16th, when the car in which they were riding became disabled. While the two were waiting in a local garage for the necessary repairs to the car, Sheriff Jack Killingsworth entered the building. Richetti, who immediately recognized the sheriff, seized a machine gun and held the sheriff and the garage attendants up against the wall. Floyd drew two .45 caliber machine pistols and ordered all parties to remain motionless. Floyd and Richetti then transferred their arsenal into another automobile and ordered the sheriff to enter that vehicle. The two, along with their prisoner, drove to Deepwater, Missouri, abandoned that automobile and commandeered another. After releasing the sheriff, they arrived in Kansas City about 10:00\u00a0p.m. on June 16. There, Floyd and Richetti abandoned that automobile and stole another car to which they transferred their baggage and firearms. Finally, that same night, they met Miller and went with him to his home. There Miller told them of his plan to free Frank Nash.\nEarly the next morning, according to the FBI account, Miller, Floyd, and Richetti drove to Union Station in a Chevrolet sedan. There they took up their positions to await the arrival of Nash and his captors.\n",

The perpetrator, Lisa Marie Montgomery,[3] then aged 36-years-old, strangled Stinnett to death and cut her fetus (eight months into gestation) from her womb. Montgomery was arrested in Kansas the next day and charged with kidnapping resulting in death \u2013 a federal crime. Stinnett's baby was safely recovered by authorities and returned to the father.[4]\nMontgomery was tried and found guilty in 2007. She was executed by lethal injection shortly after midnight on January 13, 2021, having exhausted the appeals process. Montgomery became the first female federal inmate since 1953 to be executed by the United States federal government, and the fourth overall.[5][6][7]\nBobbie Jo Stinnett was born on December 4, 1981 and graduated from Nodaway-Holt High School in Graham, Missouri, in 2000.[8] Stinnett and her husband ran a dog-breeding business from their residence in Skidmore.[9]\nStinnett and Montgomery had met through dog show events and had ongoing interactions in an online Rat Terrier chatroom called Ratter Chatter.[10][11] Montgomery told Stinnett that she was pregnant too, leading to the two women chatting online and exchanging e-mails about their pregnancies.[12]:\u200a155\u200a\nOn December 16, 2004, Montgomery entered Stinnett's house and murdered her by strangulation. Montgomery then cut Stinnett's unborn child from her womb and fled the scene.[5] There was no sign of forced entry; authorities believe that Montgomery, posing as customer \"Darlene Fischer\", had arranged to visit Stinnett's house on that day.[9] It is known that Stinnett was expecting the arrival in Skidmore of prospective buyers for a terrier at about the time of her murder.[12]\nStinnett was discovered by her mother Becky Harper, lying in a pool of blood, approximately an hour after the murder.[13] Harper immediately called authorities and described the wounds inflicted upon her daughter as appearing as if her \"stomach had exploded.\"[14] Paramedics were unsuccessful in attempts to revive Stinnett, and she was pronounced dead at St. Francis Hospital in Maryville.[15] Montgomery allegedly called her husband, Kevin, that same day around 5:15\u00a0p.m. saying that, on a shopping trip to Topeka, she had gone into labor and given birth.\nThe following day, December 17, police arrested Montgomery at her farmhouse in Melvern, Kansas. A witness would later report that on the morning before her arrest, Montgomery took the infant, her husband, and two teenage sons to a restaurant for breakfast. Police had initially gone to Montgomery's home after tracing online communications to her IP address, hoping to interview her as a witness.[16] When they arrived, they found a car matching the description of the one at the crime scene, and when they entered the home, they found Montgomery inside, holding the infant, and watching television. Montgomery was arrested an hour later after her story fell apart and she confessed.[16] The kidnapped newborn, whom she claimed as her own, was recovered and soon placed in custody of the father.[17][18] The quick recovery and capture was attributed to the use of forensic computer investigations which tracked Montgomery and Stinnett's online communication.\nThe investigation was aided by the issuance of an AMBER alert to enlist the public's help. The alert was initially denied as it had not been used before in an unborn child's case and thus there was no description of the victim. Eventually after intervention by Congressman Sam Graves, the alert was implemented.[16] DNA testing was used to confirm the infant's identity.[19]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nBucklew v. Precythe, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the standards for challenging methods of capital punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In a 5\u20134 decision, the Court held that when a convict sentenced to death challenges the State's method of execution due to claims of excessive pain, the convict must show that other alternative methods of execution exist and clearly demonstrate they would cause less pain than the state-determined one.[3][4][5] The Court's opinion emphasized the precedential force of its prior decisions in Baze v. Rees[1] and Glossip v. Gross.[2]\nIn March 1996, Russell Earl Bucklew (May 16, 1968 \u2013 October 1, 2019) murdered Michael Sanders, with whom his former girlfriend Stephanie Ray took shelter after the breakup of their relationship, then kidnapped and raped Ray. He was sentenced to death by the state of Missouri in May 1997, and failed to have the conviction overturned in legal challenges which had completed by 2006.[6] During this period, Missouri, as well as several other states, changed its protocol for death sentences by lethal injection to a combination of drugs. Missouri itself had to clear this change through the courts, so from 2006 through 2010, only two inmates were executed.[6]\nBucklew and other convicts with death sentences across the country attempted to legally challenge states' refusal to use other protocols besides lethal injection through the courts, arguing that this was a violation of their Eighth Amendment rights. This ultimately resulted in Baze v. Rees, decided by the Supreme Court in 2008, where it was determined that lethal injection by drugs was constitutional and did not violate the Eighth Amendment.[1] Further, Baze established a test for future challenges to methods of execution under the Eighth Amendment, in that inmates must show that a \"feasible, readily implemented\" alternative procedure that would \"significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain\". With the decision in Baze, the Supreme Court invalidated the other ongoing challenges, including that of Bucklew, and ordered states who had already gained approval for lethal injection to resume executions.[7]\nHowever, Missouri was forced to put its death penalties on hold, as one of the companies providing one of the injected drugs, sodium thiopental, had been pressured by anti-death penalty advocates and its dwindling supplies to stop selling the drug for such purposes.[6] By 2012, Missouri had altered its process to a single drug, first to propofol and later to pentobarbital, and in 2014, began scheduling lethal injections, including for Bucklew.[8] Bucklew sought a new lawsuit on challenging the use of the new drug for lethal injection on the basis that due his own personal health, suffering from cavernous hemangioma, that the injection could cause vascular tumors that would not allow the drug to properly circulate, and thus could experience tremendous pain before the drug shut down his systems. Bucklew asserted both facial and as-applied challenges. While the district court denied his challenge, the Supreme Court agreed to put the execution on hold to allow his appeals to be heard. In the Eighth Circuit, the court rejected Bucklew's facial challenge, as well as turned down his as-applied challenge as given but allowed Bucklew's case to be reheard if he could demonstrate that there was a feasible alternative, as per Baze.[9] Prior to the rehearing, the Supreme Court concluded in Glossip v. Gross in 2015 that affirmed the Baze requirement that an Eighth Amendment challenge to capital punishment puts the onus on inmates to show that there exists an alternative that is \"feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduces a substantial risk of severe pain.\"[2]\nWhen Bucklew returned to court in 2015 he had amended his claim with the suggestion that lethal gas was a viable alternative to lethal injection, and later identified nitrogen as a viable alternative (e.g. via inert gas asphyxiation). This gave enough possibility of a triable remedy that allowed the case to proceed to an additional discovery phase. Bucklew had brought in an expert witness in anesthesiology who had affirmed that even after the injection Bucklew would still have brain function and could experience pain, based on a study done with horses.  Eventually both the district and Eighth Circuit rejected these claims.[10] The Supreme Court intervened a second time, in early 2018, while Justice Anthony Kennedy had still been serving, to put Bucklew's case on hold and evaluate his case.[11]\nThe Court issued its opinion on April 1, 2019. In a 5\u20134 decision falling along ideological lines, the Court upheld the Eighth Circuit's decision, affirming that Baze and Glossip provided the proper tests, and the evidence presented by Bucklew was not sufficient for either a facial or as-applied challenge to the Eighth Amendment.[3] Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion, joined by the other four conservative Justices. Gorsuch wrote that the Eighth Amendment \"forbids 'cruel and unusual' methods of capital punishment but does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death\"; while a constitutionally-valid death sentencing like hanging would require a moment of intense pain, the Eighth Amendment would forbid methods like being drawn and quartered that \"intensified the death sentence by 'superadding' terror, pain or disgrace.\"[12] Gorsuch criticized the choice of death by inert gas asphyxiation, as it was neither a method prescribed by Missouri, and while it was an authorized method in three other states, no one has been put to death by the method to date.[13] Gorsuch also wrote that Bucklew, by this point, had spent twenty years on death row, and there is reasonable expectation by states to complete death sentences in a timely manner. Gorsuch argued that inmates that were seeking alternative methods under the Baze/Glossip test in good faith should readily be able to show evidence for their case, and considered that Bucklew's continuing challenges were stalling tactics.[12][13] Both Thomas and Kavanaugh wrote concurring opinions. Thomas argued that under the Eighth Amendment, the Court only had to show that Missouri's choice of death sentence was not purposely designed to inflict additional pain on the inmate.[13]\nThe dissenting opinion was written by Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by the other three liberal justices on the bench. Breyer argued that Bucklew had sufficiently demonstrated that death by lethal injection could cause unnecessary intense pain and an \"excruciating and grotesque\" execution due to his conditions, and in his as-applied challenge, that death by nitrogen gas met the standards for Baze and Glossip. While Missouri did not use this method, it was authorized (though never previously implemented) in three other states.[12] Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a separate opinion, urging that there is no reason to rush execution sentences, particularly to avoid having any judicial mistakes harm the impact of the Constitution.[13]\nOn June 25, 2019, the Missouri Supreme Court scheduled an execution date of October 1 for Bucklew.[14]\nMissouri Governor Mike Parson denied clemency for Bucklew on the morning of his planned execution, and he was executed as scheduled on October 1, 2019. He was pronounced dead at 6:23 p.m. CDT, eight minutes after being administered a lethal dose of pentobarbital.[15][16]\nThere were no reported complications with the execution.  Corrections staff took precautions with Bucklew such as elevating the head of the gurney to prevent his choking on blood if a tumor were to burst and sedating him with Valium before the execution.[17][18]\n",

        "paragraph": "On August 19, 2015, a Moorish man named Mansur Ball-Bey was shot and killed by a St. Louis police officer who was executing a search warrant at a house where Ball-Bey was present. Rumors surrounded the killing of Ball-Bey as to whether he was unarmed when shot by police, and crowds gathered in the street to express anger at the killing. The demonstrators, in response to harassment and violence by STL Metro police officers, engaged in acts of civil unrest well into the night. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney's office conducted a subsequent investigation and determined that the evidence did not support criminal charges against the two officers involved.\nOn the morning of August 19, 2015, at least 15 police officers and ATF agents[1] arrived at Ball-Bey's aunt's home in the Fountain Park neighborhood of St. Louis to execute a search warrant. As police prepared to enter the home, Ball-Bey and one other man ran from the house.[2] Police said that Ball-Bey had pointed a handgun with extended ammunition magazine at them, prompting them to open fire.[1] After police fired their weapons, Ball-Bey was struck in the back and killed.[2] Police said that crack cocaine were recovered from the scene.[3] Police also said that they recovered two stolen firearms at the scene,[3] specifically .40-caliber handguns.[1] No usable DNA evidence was recovered from the guns, which is not unusual.[1] However, social media postings by Ball-Bey showed me holding a gun matching the guns found on the scene.[1] Ball-Bey had no criminal history, but \"photos found on his cellphone and YouTube videos show him wearing T-shirts naming a gang in St. Louis.\"[1]\nOne witness, an off-duty officer \"said he saw Ball-Bey running with a gun in his hand and his arm extended before the witness ducked behind a parked truck. The witness said he could hear the shooting but could not see it but reported seeing Ball-Bey toss a gun near a trash bin afterward.\"[1] The gun was loaded.[1]\nBall-Bey's family disputed the police claim, claiming that the gun had been planted on Ball-Bey by police.[1] The family's attorney claimed Ball-Bey was running from police when shot, explaining the bullet wound to the back.[4] In contrast, the attorney for the two officers stated that \"My client fired in defense of his partner ... when (Ball-Bey) turns toward (one officer) with a gun that has an extended clip with a 30-round magazine, the policemen have no choice but to pull the trigger.\"[2]\nIn the afternoon of the same day, angry residents took to the streets of Fountain Park to express outrage at the killing of Ball-Bey. Police responded with riot officers, and protests soon took a turn for the worse as protesters began throwing bricks, rocks and bottles at the police, who responded with tear gas.[5]\nAccording to police, over the course of the night, bricks and bottles were thrown at officers, and police responded with tear gas to disperse crowds.[3][6] The police chief reported nine arrests, the torching of one car, and several reports of attempted robbery.[3] St. Louis Alderman Antonio French reported that the disordered was partially fueled by misinformation, including false reports that Ball-Bey was 13 years old.[3]\nThe day following the shooting, about 200 people attended a vigil in St. Louis in protest of the killing; unlike the events of the previous night, the vigil was peaceful.[3]\nIn 2017, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri (ACLU) filed a lawsuit over the police handling of protests following the shooting of Ball-Bey. The ACLU of Missouri alleges that the police deployed tear gas indiscriminately and without warning.[7][8]\nA few days after the shooting, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce announced that her office would conduct an investigation.[2][4] In June 2016, the circuit attorney office's report was made public, and Joyce announced that no charges would be filed against the two officers who shot Ball-Bey. Joyce said that more than two dozen people were interviewed during the investigation. She stated that eyewitness accounts and other evidence showed that it could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the officers did not act in self-defense.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "Glennon Edward Engleman (February 6, 1927 \u2013 March 3, 1999) was an American dentist, contract killer, and serial killer. Engleman, a United States Army veteran and a St. Louis dentist, planned and carried out at least five murders for monetary gain over the course of 30 years. He was already serving two life sentences in a Missouri state prison when he pled guilty to the murder of a man and his wealthy parents in a separate contract killing that occurred in Illinois. Engleman was a sociopath, once stating that his talent was to kill without remorse, and he enjoyed planning and carrying out killings and disposing of the remains in order that it would net him financial rewards.\nHis first known killing occurred in collaboration with his ex-wife. His ex-wife Ruth married another man, raised his life insurance and then Engleman killed him, both sharing the benefits. Later he would repeat these tactics for other murders.\nEngleman would use his financial worth, sex and charm to manipulate women he was close to, ex-wives, lovers and his dental assistant, in helping him formulate and execute elaborate murder schemes. This led to one of his lovers, Barbara Boyle, being convicted as an accomplice and serving just under half of a 50-year sentence. Another accomplice, Robert Handy, was also convicted and served time in prison. Methods used to kill his victims included shooting, bludgeoning with a sledgehammer and explosives. The exact number of his victims is unknown.\nHe is the subject of Susan Crane Bakos 1988 book Appointment for Murder. The cases against him were re-enacted in a rare, two-part episode of the crime documentary series \"The FBI Files\".\nEngleman was born the youngest of four children, his father was a member of the United States Air Force. He was raised in the middle class and lived in a nice home that his parents owned. Academically he was an above average student in school, but he didn't excel in any specific subject.[citation needed]\nHe graduated in dentistry at Washington University in St. Louis, in 1954.[1] He had been admitted under the GI Bill, having previously served in the US Army Air Corps.\n1958: Engleman is suspected of the death of James Stanley Bullock, 27, a clerk for Union Electric Company of Missouri and part-time student.[2] Shot near the St. Louis Art Museum. Edna Ruth Bullock (n\u00e9e Ball) and James Bullock were married on June 28, 1958, they had been married for five and half months on the date he was murdered. Edna Ruth Bullock was Engleman's ex-wife prior to her marriage with James Bullock. She collected $64,000 (equivalent to $601,000 in 2021)[3] from James Bullock's life insurance.[4][5]\n1963: Engleman is suspected in the murder of Eric Frey, a business associate of Engleman at Pacific Drag Strip, in which Frey and Engleman were partners. Engleman struck him with a rock, pushed him down a well and used dynamite to blow him up afterwards. He then divided the insurance proceeds with Frey's widow.[6][2]\n1976: Peter J. Halm was shot in Pacific, Missouri. His wife, Carmen Miranda Halm, a former dental assistant trainee who had worked for Engleman and known him since childhood, ordered the hit to collect a $60,000 (equivalent to $286,000 in 2021)[3] policy of life insurance on Halm.[2] Engleman was convicted of capital murder for killing Halm and sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 50 years.[7]\n1977: Arthur and Vernita Gusewelle at their farmhouse near Edwardsville, Illinois. Arthur was shot; Vernita bashed to death. Engleman then murdered their son Ronald Gusewelle in East St. Louis, Illinois 17 months later so his widow Barbara Gusewelle Boyle could claim the millions in life insurance she had taken out on her husband, the sole heir to his parents' oil business.[8] Boyle collected approximately $340,000 (equivalent to $1,520,000 in 2021)[3] following her husband's murder.[citation needed] Boyle was convicted in her husband's murder but was acquitted of killing his parents. She was subsequently sentenced to 50 years in prison for the murder of her husband.[9][10] She was released from the Dwight Correctional Center on October 10, 2009.[2][11] Robert Handy, the accomplice, pled guilty to conspiring to commit the three Gusewelle killings and was sentenced to 14 years and served his time in prison. Engleman confessed to the three killings while in prison.[12] He later pled guilty to the murders and received three life terms without parole.[13]\n",

        "paragraph": "Levi Harrington (d. April 3, 1882) was a young African-American who, on April 3, 1882, was abducted from police custody by a large white mob of several hundred participants and lynched in Kansas City, Missouri, hanged from a beam on the Bluff Street Bridge and shot.[1][2] This followed the fatal shooting of a police officer, Patrick Jones, earlier that day.[3] The next day another man, George Grant, was accused of the crime, and Harrington was declared innocent.  However, the evidence against Grant was so weak that he was reportedly tried and acquitted three times and accepted a 2-year prison sentence in a plea bargain on the fourth trial.[2]\nThere were reports at the time that the accusations against Levi Harrington were not befitting his character, as a husband and father to five children living near Kansas City.[2] The plaque commemorating his death described Mr Harrington as being \"sober and industrious, saved his money, and cared for his family\".[1]\nLevi Harrington was one of at least 60 African Americans victims of racial terror lynching killed in Missouri between 1877 and 1950.[4][5]\nAnother man, George Grant, was captured the same night the lynching took place and charged with the murder of the police officer.  In 1884, after hung juries in four separate trials, Grant pleaded guilty to manslaughter and served two years prison before being released.  Meanwhile no one was charged with the murder of Harrington, in spite of having hundreds of witnesses including the officers who were overpowered by the mob.[6]\nHarrington was one of almost 4400 racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950 in a registry compiled by the National Memorial for Peace and Justice project of the Equal Justice Initiative.[7]  A memorial plaque documenting Harrington's lynching is part of this National Memorial for Peace and Justice.  It was dedicated in a ceremony Dec. 1, 2018, at the southwest corner of Ermine Chase Jr. Park, at the corner of W. 10th and Summit streets,[8] overlooking the location of the Bluff St. bridge.[9]\nEight months earlier on April 2, 2018, Kansas City Mayor Sly James and other leaders gathered to collect soil from the lynching site and published official acknowledgements of the lynching.[10]\nIn 2020, in partnership with the Equal Justice Initiative, the Community Remembrance Project of Missouri was formally established by Missourians to work in coordination with communities throughout the state.[11] This project seeks to educate, raise awareness and begin a process of reconciliation for the history of racial injustice concerning African Americans in Missouri. [12]\nBeginning in 2018, the Community Remembrance Project of Missouri began collecting jars of soil from lynching sites across the state,[5] with plans to erect more historical markers. As of June 2020, the organization plan has announced plans to establish a permanent exhibit at the Black Archives of Mid-America, located in Kansas City, Missouri, to acknowledge actions racial injustices.[12]\nIn early 2019 the sign had been defaced with graffiti.[13] On Sunday, June 14, 2020, the plaque was found broken off its pedestal and thrown off a nearby cliff.  Rev. Dr. Vernon Howard, Jr., the President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Kansas City, was not surprised to hear of the vandalism, siting a resurgence in hate against such black symbols as a revitalised problem. This sort of vandalism reminds us of the need for memorials like this, he added.[14]\n",

        "paragraph": "Marvin Lee Irvin (born May 4, 1949) is an American serial killer and former police officer who murdered two women in St. Joseph, Missouri in September and October 1990, and after his arrest confessed to an additional 1979 murder, which up to that point he had been the prime suspect in for years. For all three crimes, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.[1]\nMarvin Lee Irvin was born on May 4, 1949, in St. Joseph. His family rented a three-story home, and they were friendly to neighbors, who recalled Irvin as a quiet but polite boy.[2] Irvin graduated from Highland High School, and in 1970 joined the St. Joseph Police Department as an officer, but it was not long before he resigned.[3] In April 1974 Irvin was accused of raping a 15-year-old girl in Kansas, whom he had allegedly abducted outside a drug store in St. Joseph. He was arrested, but the charge was dropped after the girl refused to testify. Irvin met up with another young girl named Ruth West in 1974, and the two sparked a relationship, and at age 15, West delivered Irvin's baby. West would later describe their relationship as abusive, claiming Irvin was emotionally manipulative.[3]\nIn 1979, Ruth, her brother Calvin West, and Calvin's wife 19-year-old Micki Jo West left for California, with Irvin following not far behind. In March, Ruth and Irvin officially married in Ventura, but by the time they returned to Missouri, their relationship had downgraded, with Ruth claiming Irvin beat her. In August, she and her 4-year-old son fled and took refuge in a motel in Elwood, Kansas, only sharing this information with her mother, her sister, the couple who helped her relocate, and Micki Jo West.[3]\nOn September 11, Micki Jo West was scheduled to show up to her job at a hospital, but she never arrived. Later that same day, Irvin and two friends broke into Ruth's motel room, dragged her and their son into a car, and drove them back to St. Joseph. When Micki was reported missing, Irvin became a suspect, and he was required to take multiple polygraph tests, but the tests were inconclusive. Ruth West filed for divorce from Irvin in October after another domestic dispute, which resulted in Irvin chasing West barefoot across St. Joseph.[3]\nOn September 11, 1986, exactly seven years since Micki's disappearance, an anonymous letter was found inside a Kansas City shopping mall. The letter, which was addressed to the St. Joseph police, contained details about the writer being with Marvin Irvin at the time of Micki's disappearance, claiming he killed her. However, the writer left no details about who he/she was, and police were not able to follow up on an exact lead.[4] In 1988, a television reporter named Therman Mitchell received a letter addressed to him. The letter contained details about where Micki's body was, and the writer inviting Mitchell to show him where Micki's body was. Instead of meeting up with the anonymous sender, Mitchell aired a news story on the letter, pleading for the sender to come forward.[5] That same year, Irvin and another woman moved to Ames, Iowa, where Irvin got a job working at railroad tracks. There, on March 30, Janet Huegerich filed a police report because Irvin had shot over her head multiple times.[3] The resulting police confrontation ended with a police chase across multiple counties, with over 20 police officers in pursuit. After his eventual arrest, Irvin pleaded guilty to avoiding arrest and two weapons charges and was sentenced to five years probation.[3]\nIrvin returned to St. Joseph not long after. There, on September 17, 1990, meat cutter 31-year-old Patricia Diane Rose visited a local bar named Brew's Blue Town to take a break from work and was due to return, but she never did and was reported missing.[6] A month later, on October 29, 33-year-old Crystal Lynn Simmons also disappeared, last seen at downtown bar.[7] During the investigation, investigators received a tip, saying that Simmons was last seen with a man named Marvin Lee Irvin, and to inspect his truck as evidence.[6]\nThey followed up on it and received a warrant to search his vehicle. They temporarily removed the seats and discovered a partially wet towel soaked in blood. Further tests on the blood proved it belonged to Simmons, and Irvin was arrested. In November, skeletal remains of two women were found in a cornfield in Kansas, both were later positively identified as belonging to both women.[8] An autopsy on both declared their cause of death as multiple blows to the head.[9]\nWhile in jail awaiting charges, Irvin denied killing anybody. His brother openly believed this, accusing officials of setting-up Marvin, saying, \"They want a guy for a lot of cases, I feel like the whole thing is kind of a set up.\"[6] Detectives learned that Irvin was a suspect in the disappearance of Micki Jo West, and they used that to build up their case further. Over time, Irvin changed his mind and pleaded guilty to all three murders, offering details to where he buried West's body. During his sentencing, he said that in 1979, he took West to a cornfield in Kansas, where he proceeded to kill her and bury her body.[1]\nIn October 1991, Irvin pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and one count of second-degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of parole. Irvin led investigators to a farm in Kansas where he said he disposed of West. Authorities prepared search dogs and a bulldozer to scour the area, but due to heavy rainfall, the search was delayed.[10] Another search attempt was made on October 11, but the search team was unable to find her body.[11] As of 2022, West's body has yet to be found.\n",

The case generated controversy over allegations that anti-gay bias led to Lingar's death sentence.[1][2]\nOn the evening of January 5, 1985, Lingar and his friend, Dave Smith, were drinking alcohol and driving around Doniphan, Missouri. They saw Thomas Allen's jeep, which had run out of gas, parked at the side of the road. They offered to take him to a gas station and he accepted. After driving out of town, Lingar ordered Allen to undress. He then ordered Allen to masturbate, but Allen was too frightened to do so. Lingar then drove to his parents' home to retrieve a Winchester .22-caliber rifle. He then drove to a rural area, pointed the gun at Allen and again ordered him to masturbate. Allen asked to get out of the car to urinate, which Lingar and Smith allowed him to do. All three of them got out of the car, and Lingar shot Allen while Allen was urinating. Allen then got up, got into the car and started the ignition but the car stalled because Allen didn't push in the clutch. Lingar shot Allen three more times then, realizing Allen was still alive, Lingar retrieved a tire iron from the car's trunk and used it to beat Allen. After Lingar and Smith got back into the car they noticed that Allen was still alive. Lingar ran him over with the car and then sped away. Lingar and Smith, after talking to Lingar's brother, then disposed of the body, dumping it over a bridge, and cleaned the car. They later pawned the car and dumped the murder weapon on a country road in Kentucky.[3]\nIn 1986 Lingar was found guilty of murdering Thomas Allen and was sentenced to death by Judge Kenneth D. Pratte after the jury recommended the death penalty. In 1997, after the Missouri Supreme Court upheld Lingar's conviction and sentence, Lingar told his attorneys that he didn't want any further appeals; he later changed his mind.[4]\nDave Smith, in exchange for testifying against Lingar and pleading guilty to second-degree murder, was sentenced to ten years in prison.[5] He was released after serving six years of his sentence.[6]\nThe attorneys who worked on Lingar's appeal argued the prosecution presented evidence about Lingar's sexual orientation that was irrelevant and prejudicial, and that his attorney at his first trial was inexperienced and failed to present evidence Dave Smith may have masterminded the murder of Thomas Allen. They also argued Lingar's mental state was a mitigating factor, and that he had mental disorders which were undiagnosed at the time of his trial. While in prison he was diagnosed as having Axis I disorders acute paranoid disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymic disorder along with an Axis II personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder with dependent traits.[7] The Eighth Circuit of Appeals upheld Lingar's death sentence, and an execution date was set after the U.S Supreme Court declined to hear Lingar's case.[4][8]\nOrganizations and publications including Queer Watch, the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International, Village Voice and The Advocate supported Lingar's appeal and suggested that he was a victim of homophobia;[1][9][10] they believed that the prosecutors prejudiced jurors against the defendant by introducing evidence of Lingar's homosexuality. The prosecutors denied these accusations and said that testimony about Lingar's sexual orientation was meant to establish motive for the murder, and that he was sentenced to die because of the brutality of his crime.[5]\nApproximately forty demonstrators gathered outside of Potosi Correctional Center on February 6, 2001, to protest Lingar's execution.[1] His last meal was a corned beef sandwich and french fries. He declined to make a final statement, but his family issued a statement on his behalf. Stanley Lingar was executed by lethal injection at 12:06\u00a0a.m. on February 7, 2001.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Bridge Murder case, also known as the Bridge Table Murder case, was the trial of Myrtle Adkins Bennett (born March 20, 1895, in Tillar, Arkansas), a Kansas City housewife, for the murder of her husband John G. Bennett over a game of contract bridge in September 1929.[1]\nMyrtle and John spent much of Sunday, September 29, 1929, with their upstairs neighbors, Charles and Myrna Hofman.[1] The husbands played a round of golf at the Indian Hills Country Club that morning, and then went back to the links that afternoon with their wives joining them. At dusk, they returned to the Bennett apartment at 902 Ward Parkway in the Country Club District of Kansas City. After sharing dinner, they sat down to a game of bridge in the Bennett living room, the couples playing as partners, the Hofmans versus the Bennetts. After midnight, as the Hofmans began to pull ahead, the Bennetts began to bicker. In the ultimate hand, John failed to make his four spades contract and Myrtle, frustrated by the failure, called him \"a bum bridge player\". He stood and slapped her in the face several times, and announced he was leaving.[2] He said he would spend the night in a motel in Saint Joseph, Missouri. As he packed his bag, and moved from room to room, he mocked his wife. Myrtle told the Hofmans, \"Only a cur would strike a woman in front of guests.\"[3]\nAfter an ongoing argument, John Bennett went to pack a suitcase as he told Myrtle to retrieve the handgun he typically carried on the road for protection. Myrtle walked down the hall to the bedroom of her mother, Alice Adkins. Still sobbing, Myrtle reached into a drawer with linens and pulled out his .32 Colt semi automatic, and walked into the den. There, she brushed past Charles Hofman, and shot at John's back twice in the bathroom of the apartment. John escaped into the hallway, but fell to the floor in their living room.\nMyrtle Bennett was tried by Judge Ralph S. Latshaw. The trial began on February 23, 1931, and lasted eleven days. Her defence was James A. Reed, former three-term U.S. Senator and onetime Democratic presidential candidate. Reed showed jurors that John Bennett had been previously violent and abusive, and attempted to explain that Mrs Bennett was either insane or acted in self-defence. The judge disallowed the prosecution, James R. Page, to submit John Bennett's nephew Byrd Rice, as he was not on the original list of witnesses. After an eight-hour deliberation, the jury returned a not guilty verdict.[1][4] The prosecution's assistant, John Hill, said, \"It looks like an open season on husbands.\"[5]\nThe case caught the public imagination, and was subject to press attention by the New York Journal, not for the trial itself, but for the bridge game. The case was a media sensation and a flashpoint in the bridge craze sweeping the nation. The Journal invited speculation from bridge experts, including Sidney Lenz, on the game, what hands had been played, and whether different play, or alternative hands, would have prevented the murder.[6] None of the people present in the apartment at the time later recalled exactly what the hands were.[6] When the case came to trial, Myrtle Bennett was defended by former U.S. Senator James A. Reed.[1]\nEly Culbertson, the Barnum of the bridge movement, watched the trial closely from New York. Culbertson used the Bennett tragedy to his advantage. He sold bridge and himself, telling housewives that the game was a great way to defuse the marital tensions pent-up in daily life. He told housewives that, at the bridge table, they could be their husbands' equal, and more.\nCulbertson wrote about the killing and trial in his new magazine, The Bridge World.[7]  In packed halls on the lecture circuit, he analyzed the so-called \"Fatal Hand\" \u2013 even as he knew the details were fabricated. In lectures, Culbertson suggested that if only the Bennetts had been playing the Culbertson System of bidding, then 36-year-old John Bennett might still have been alive.[8]\nOnly 35 years old at the time of her acquittal, Myrtle Bennett lived for another 61 years, dying at the age of 96 in Miami, Florida, in January 1992. She had moved into obscurity soon after the trial, her name fading from headlines. She never remarried, nor did she have children. After World War II and throughout the 1950s, she worked as executive head of housekeeping at the elegant Hotel Carlyle in New York City, living alone there in an apartment.[9] At the Carlyle, she developed friendships with the rich and famous, including the actors Mary Pickford and her husband Buddy Rogers, and also Henry Ford II.\nThe widow Bennett later traveled the world, working for a hotel chain, and played bridge until nearly the end of her life. In an interview with the author Gary Pomerantz,[9] Myrtle Bennett's cousin, Carolyn Scruggs of Arkansas, said that Mrs. Bennett never spoke with her about the shooting. Once, though, Ms. Scruggs told Mrs. Bennett, \"I sometimes think of your life \u2013\" But Myrtle Bennett interrupted, and said, \"Well, my dear, it was a great tragedy and a great mistake.\" Scruggs stammered to say, \"I guess I want you to know that I understand it.\" But Myrtle Bennett said, \"No, my dear, you don't understand it.\"[citation needed]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn June 14, 2015, sheriff's deputies in Greene County, Missouri, United States, found the body of Clauddine \"Dee Dee\" Blanchard (n\u00e9e Pitre; born May 3, 1967, in Chackbay, Louisiana) face down in the bedroom of her house just outside Springfield,[2] lying on the bed in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier. There was no sign of her daughter, Gypsy Rose, who, according to Blanchard, had chronic conditions including leukemia, asthma, and muscular dystrophy, and who had the \"mental capacity of a 7-year-old due to brain damage\" as the result of premature birth.\nAfter reading troubling Facebook posts earlier in the evening, concerned neighbors notified the police, reporting that Dee Dee might have fallen victim to foul play and that Gypsy Rose, whose wheelchair and medications were still in the house, might have been abducted. The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult and did not have any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.[3]\nFurther investigation found that some of the doctors who had examined Gypsy Rose had found no evidence of the claimed disorders. One physician suspected that Dee Dee had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a mental disorder that causes a parent or other caretaker to exaggerate, fabricate, or induce illness in a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. Dee Dee had changed her name after her family, who suspected she had poisoned her stepmother, confronted her about how she treated Gypsy Rose. Nonetheless, many people accepted her situation as true, and the two benefited from the efforts of charities such as Children's Mercy Hospital, Habitat for Humanity, Ronald McDonald House, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nDee Dee had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, subjecting her to unnecessary surgery and medication, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. Marc Feldman, an international expert on factitious disorders, stated that this was the first case he had experienced in which an abused child killed an abusive parent.[4] Gypsy Rose pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is serving a 10-year sentence;[1] after a brief trial in November 2018, Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[5]\nDee Dee Blanchard was born Clauddine Pitre in Chackbay, Louisiana, near the Gulf Coast in 1967, and grew up with her family in nearby Golden Meadow.[6] Blanchard was one of five children of Claude Anthony Pitre, Sr. and Emma Lois Gisclair.[7]\nRelatives recalled that she had a habit of stealing from her family, which they speculated was a form of retaliation when \"things didn't go her way\".[8] At some point early in her adult life, she worked as a nurse's aide.[3] The family expressed suspicion that in 1997 she might have killed her own mother by denying her food.[8]\nWhen she was 24, she became pregnant by Rod Blanchard, then 17. They named their daughter Gypsy Rose because Clauddine liked the name Gypsy and Rod was a fan of Guns N' Roses.[a] Shortly before Gypsy Rose's birth in July 1991, the couple separated when Rod realized he \"got married for the wrong reasons\". He resisted Clauddine's efforts to get him to return, and she took her newborn daughter to live with her family.[3]\nAccording to Rod, who remained involved with his daughter at this point, by the time Gypsy was three months old, her mother was convinced that the infant had sleep apnea and began taking her to the hospital where repeated overnight stays with a sleep monitor and other tests found no sign of the condition. Clauddine subsequently became convinced that Gypsy had a wide range of health issues, which she attributed to an unspecified chromosomal disorder.[3] At some point her mother claimed that Gypsy had muscular dystrophy, and made her use a walker.[9]\n",

The murder, reportedly motivated partially by the theft of Shelton's Stetson hat, made Shelton an icon of toughness and style in the minds of early folk and blues musicians, and inspired the popular folk song \"Stagger Lee.\" The story endures in the many versions of the song that have circulated since the late 19th century.\nThe historical Lee Shelton was an African American man born in 1865 in Texas.[1]:\u200a37\u200a He later worked as a carriage driver in St. Louis, Missouri, where he gained a reputation as a pimp and gambler, and evidently served as a captain in a black \"Four Hundred Club,\" a political and social club with a dubious reputation.[2][1]:\u200a42\u201343\u200a He was not a common pimp \u2014 as described by Cecil Brown, \"Lee Shelton belonged to a group of pimps known in St. Louis as the 'Macks.' The Macks were not just 'urban strollers;' they presented themselves as objects to be observed.[1]:\u200a23\u200a He was nicknamed \"Stag Lee\" or \"Stack Lee,\" possibly because he \"went stag,\" meaning he was without friends, or took the nickname from a well-known riverboat captain called \"Stack Lee.\" John and Alan Lomax claimed that the nickname came from a riverboat owned by the Lee family of Memphis called the Stack Lee, which was known for its on-board prostitution.[1]:\u200a43\u201345\u200a Lee Shelton's nickname was later corrupted into various other forms in the folk tradition.[1]:\u200a102\u200a\nOn Christmas night in 1895, Shelton shot William \"Billy\" Lyons in a St. Louis saloon following a dispute.[1]:\u200a24\u201325\u200a A story appearing in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat in 1895 read:\nWilliam Lyons, 25, a levee hand, was shot in the abdomen yesterday evening at 10 o'clock in the saloon of Bill Curtis, at Eleventh and Morgan Streets, by Lee Sheldon [sic], a carriage driver. Lyons and Sheldon were friends and were talking together. Both parties, it seems, had been drinking and were feeling in exuberant spirits. The discussion drifted to politics, and an argument was started, the conclusion of which was that Lyons snatched Sheldon's hat from his head. The latter indignantly demanded its return. Lyons refused, and Sheldon withdrew his revolver and shot Lyons in the abdomen. When his victim fell to the floor Sheldon took his hat from the hand of the wounded man and coolly walked away. He was subsequently arrested and locked up at the Chestnut Street Station. Lyons was taken to the Dispensary, where his wounds were pronounced serious. Lee Sheldon is also known as 'Stag' Lee.[3]Further details are preserved in trial accounts. For example, Shelton had first crushed Lyons' Derby hat, after which Lyons grabbed Shelton's hat and demanded restitution; Shelton then drew his gun and smacked Lyons on the head with it. Lyons lunged for Shelton and Shelton shot.[4]\nLyons eventually died of his injuries. Shelton was tried and convicted for the crime in 1897, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was paroled in 1909,[1] but was imprisoned again two years later for assault and robbery. Unable to get parole, he died in the hospital of the Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson City on March 11, 1912, from tuberculosis.[1][5]\nShelton is buried at the historic Greenwood Cemetery in Hillsdale, Missouri.[6] The Killer Blues Headstone Project raised money to place a stone on his unmarked grave, and on April 14, 2013, a marker was laid during a public ceremony.[7]\nShortly after the event, the murder became the subject of folk song tradition, known as \"Stagolee,\" \"Stagger Lee,\" and other variants. The earliest versions were likely field hollers and other work songs performed by African American laborers. The first evidence for it is a reference to \"Stack-a-Lee\" being performed by \"Prof. Charlie Lee, the piano thumper\" in the Kansas City Leavenworth Herald in 1897.[8] The song was well known in African American communities along the lower Mississippi River by 1910. That year, musicologist John Lomax received a partial transcription of the song,[9] and in 1911 two versions were published in the Journal of American Folklore by the sociologist and historian Howard W. Odum.[10]\n",

Green's decapitated body was discovered on April 28, 2001, and her head was found nearby on May 1, but remained unidentified until May 5, 2005.[3][4] Green's murder attracted significant media and public attention due to the brutality of the crime and the lengthy period without identification.[7]\nIn 2008, Green's mother and step-father were convicted for her murder.\nOn April 28, 2001, the decapitated body of a young African-American girl was found near Hibbs Park at 59th Street and Kensington Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri. On May 1, 2001, the young girl's head was found wrapped in a trash bag approximately 150 to 200 yards southeast of the body discovery site.[3] Investigators determined that she had been beaten with an ashtray found with the body and kicked several times, causing extensive injuries throughout her body, and then decapitated in an effort to keep police from being able to identify the body. The ashtray lacked DNA or fingerprints, and the unidentified girl was known by the multiple-use name Precious Doe, which was used in public broadcasts in an effort to identify her.\nThe brutality of the crime, and the fact that Green went unidentified for a long period, sparked nationwide interest in an effort to identify her. Police released sketches, computerized facial reconstructions, and at least two busts.[7]\n[8] The case was featured on the TV programs America's Most Wanted and Cold Case Files several times.[9][10][11]\nOn May 5, 2005, Precious Doe was identified as Erica Green, a three-year-old from Oklahoma. Her mother, Michelle Johnson (also known as Michelle Pierce), and her stepfather, Harrell Johnson, were charged with murder and extradited from Oklahoma to face charges in Missouri.[12][13] Michelle Johnson's eight other children were taken into state custody or placed with relatives.[14] On December 3, 2005, prosecutors announced that they would seek the death penalty against Erica's stepfather, Harrell Johnson.[15]\nPolice stated that Erica had died when Johnson had used a pair of hedge clippers to sever her head after she had been brutally beaten.[16] Johnson's cousin, Lawanda Driskell, said that Erica's mother helped Harrell dispose of the body by taking Erica from the house as if sleeping in a stroller and telling Driskell she had given Erica to the woman who had raised her while Johnson was in prison.[16]\nOn October 8, 2008, Harrell Johnson was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.[17] On October 22, 2008, Michelle Johnson was sentenced to 25 years in prison, in exchange for her 2007 guilty plea to second-degree murder and testimony against her husband.[18]\n",

Three were able to escape but one was shot to death.\nThe East St. Louis massacres were a series of outbreaks of labor and race-related violence by people that caused the deaths of an estimated 40\u2013250 African Americans in late May and early July 1917. Another 6,000 blacks were left homeless, and the rioting and vandalism cost approximately $400,000 ($8,460,000 in 2023) in property damage.\nThese race riots were one of several incidents of civil unrest that started again in the so-called American Red Summer of 1919. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington DC. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively. Both had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching into the millions of dollars.[1]\nIn addition to this racial tension, the United States' media were alarmed by terrorist attacks from radical left extremist groups. On November 16, 1919 A. Mitchell Palmer released a report about the dangers of the far left and that \u201cThe negro race,\u201d he warns, was \u201cfertile ground\u201d for the spread of radical propaganda.[2] He launched a campaign against radicalism known as the Palmer Raids in November 1919. Federal agents supported by local police rounded up large groups of suspected radicals, often based on membership in a political group rather than any action taken.\nIn November 1919 in Moberly, Missouri four African Americans beat and robbed white farmer Edward Thompson, The Dallas Express reported that Thompson had only light injuries.[3]\nFour African Americans, identified [a] as Allie Richards, George Adams, Sanfard Taylor, and James Anderson, were arrested on Thursday, November 14, 1919, and held in the nearby Macon, Missouri.[4] [5] It was reported in the press that the four were Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.) members and it was claimed that they were from Chicago.[5] [6]\nA mob of seventy five to eighty masked men, allegedly neighboring farmers, threatened to bomb the Macon jail unless the four were handed over. Macon County Sheriff Jesse Stamper folded and instructed his deputy, Bob Epperson to give  the mob the keys.[4] [3] The accused African-Americans were taken back to the outskirts of Moberly and in front of a crowd of about a hundred men, an attempt was made to hang all four on the same branch.[4] Unable to handle the combined weight the branch broke.[4] The failed hanging attempt allowed the accused to flee but armed men were able to shoot one down and the three remaining were able to escape in the chaos.[4]\nCounty authorities quickly rearrested two and a third was arrested late Sunday, November 16, 1919.[4]\nNotes\n",

After capturing the entire unit, Lyon marched the captives into town to parole them. En route, hostile secessionist crowds gathered, and after an accidental gunshot, Lyon's men fired into the mob, killing at least 28 civilians and injuring dozens of others. Several days of rioting throughout St. Louis followed. The violence ended only after martial law was imposed and Union regulars were dispatched to the city.\nLyon's actions ensured Union control of St. Louis and Missouri for the rest of the war but also deepened the ideological divisions within a state that had initially sought to remain neutral in the larger conflict.\nMissouri was a slave state, and many of its leaders were Southern sympathizers who favored secession and joining the Confederacy when the Civil War began. However, there were relatively few enslaved persons and enslavers in Missouri,[1] and only a minority initially favored secession.[citation needed]\nNevertheless, by early 1861, both pro- and anti-secession factions in Missouri were organizing military and paramilitary forces. Secessionists organized as \"Minutemen\", often assisted by state officials. On February 13, Brigadier General Daniel M. Frost enrolled five companies of St. Louis-area Minutemen as the new 2nd Regiment of the Missouri Volunteer Militia. That same month, a new law banned militia activity outside the framework of this militia, forcing pro-Union activists to organize in secret.\nOn February 28, Missouri elected a Constitutional Convention to amend the state constitution and decide the issue of secession. On March 21, the Convention voted 98 to 1 against secession but also voted not to supply weapons or men to either side if war broke out. The Convention then adjourned.\nOn April 20, several days after the Battle of Fort Sumter, a pro-Confederate mob seized the Liberty Arsenal in Liberty, Missouri, and expropriated about a thousand rifles and muskets. This sparked fears that Confederates would also seize the much larger St. Louis Arsenal, which had nearly 40,000 rifles and muskets \u2014 the largest stockpile in any slave state.\nMissouri was within the Department of the West, a geographical command of the United States Army commanded by Brigadier General William S. Harney, with its headquarters at Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis. Harney, an elderly career officer, wished to avoid open conflict with secessionist forces.\n",

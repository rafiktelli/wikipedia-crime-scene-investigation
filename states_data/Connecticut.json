Helle had told some of them, \"If something happens to me, don't assume it was an accident.\"[5][6] On December 1, the private investigator Keith Mayo reported her missing to the Newtown Police.[3] Richard Crafts was known to local law enforcement for his work as a volunteer police officer in Newtown, and in 1986 Crafts was working as a part-time police officer in the nearby town of Brookfield.[7] According to Mayo, Newtown Police initially dismissed his concerns, saying that Helle would probably return.[3]\n",

He was a member of a wealthy and well-connected industrialist family, and was able to support himself while funding a series of literary and artistic endeavors.  He published a book by poet Edgar Lee Masters, and made a documentary about mining that has been of interest to scholars.  Dick is best known for the photographs he took on behalf of the Farm Security Administration during the Great Depression, and for the violent circumstances of his death.\nSheldon Dick was the son of Albert Blake Dick, a wealthy manufacturer of mimeograph machines in Chicago, and Mary Henrietta Dick.[1] He married Dorothy Michelson, the 21-year-old daughter of scientist Albert Abraham Michelson, in 1927, shortly before Dick began studies at Corpus Christi College at Cambridge University.[2]  On returning to the United States, the couple lived in New York; their daughter, also named Dorothy, was born shortly thereafter.\nThe marriage was brief.  Mrs. Dick filed for divorce in April 1932, and stated in her suit that the couple had been separated for a year.  The divorce was concluded within a day, and she received custody of the child.[3]\n",

All were Yale College students between 1973 and 1980.\nAlexander and Reifler alleged that they were sexually harassed and/or assaulted by a flute teacher (Keith Brion) and hockey coach,[4] respectively, and that Yale provided no procedure through which they could complain. Pamela Price alleged a classic case of what is now known as quid pro quo sexual harassment, when a course instructor offered to give her an \u2018A\u2019 if she complied with his sexual demands.[5] Lisa Stone alleged that English professor Michael Cooke propositioned her during his office hours while putting his hand on her knee. Ann Olivarius alleged that the absence of a procedure for complaining about sexual harassment forced her to expend her own time and money on helping fellow students who had been sexually harassed, and that in the course of providing that help she was threatened by individuals whom she was investigating, and that Yale failed to protect her from those individuals.\n",

Crandall was a member of the American Institute of Arts, Science and Letters, a council member of the Stamford Rural Association, and a member of the Stamford Historical Society.\nCrandall's father served in various capacities as a public official within the state of New York. These included as a member of the legislature, assistant assessor, internal revenue collector, money order clerk in the post office and a number of positions in the New York Custom House. Crandall attended Greenwich Academy, but did not matriculate from an institution of higher learning. After spending the first seventeen years of his life as a farmer, he went into the mercantile business for five years, then began a literary career.[1]\nAfter working as a reporter for the New York Tribune and the New York Globe, he moved to Connecticut in 1886 as a result of ill health.  He called his tenure with New York with the roles of reporter, correspondent and editor, his \"university years\". In 1890 he published \"Representative Sonnets by American Poets\" with an exhaustive essay on the sonnet. Thereafter, he published a number of volumes of his own works from collections previously printed in newspapers and magazines in America. These publications included The Century Magazine, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, The Outlook (New York), Independent, Critic, Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, North American Review, and Outing, along with others.[2] His early collections often had a rural theme and his poems and prose would often involve farming life, as he became a serious farmer. A 1914 article in Guide to Nature Magazine[2] gave him the moniker \"Crandall - the Farmer-Poet\".\n",

Together with the 850 schools that installed them with provincial funding in 2005, the new equipment means about 80 per cent of Ontario's 4,000 elementary schools will have secured front doors.[52] In the Greater Toronto Area, 1,287 schools received funding through their 12 school boards such as the Toronto Catholic District School Board, Toronto District School Board, Durham Catholic District School Board, and York Region District School Board.\n",

Frank Piccolo stood at 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91\u00a0kg) with black hair, brown eyes, and had a husky build. He was married to Virginia Paglinco and was the father of four children.[1]  Piccolo and his family lived in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He was the cousin of Guido Penosi.[2]\nIn 1980, Piccolo attempted to blackmail money from Wayne Newton. Newton was trying to disengage himself from a financial investment in a Las Vegas, Nevada tabloid newspaper, but was being threatened by his partners in the venture. When the Las Vegas Police Department was unable to stop the threats, Newton turned to his friend Guido Penosi for help. Penosi referred Newton to Piccolo, who then used his influence to stop the threats. Piccolo then performed a similar favor for Newton's business advisor.[3]\n",

He was enslaved at 6 years of age, but his father managed to buy back his freedom.\nBy 1824, Colvocoresses was sent to Baltimore in the United States by his father.[1] He became the adopted son of Captain Alden Partridge, the founder of the American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy (later Norwich University) in Norwich, Vermont.

Since the 1976 United States Supreme Court decision in Gregg v. Georgia until Connecticut repealed capital punishment in 2012, Connecticut had only executed one person, Michael Bruce Ross in 2005. Initially, the 2012 law allowed executions to proceed for those still on death row and convicted under the previous law, but on August 13, 2015, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that applying the death penalty only for past cases was unconstitutional.[1]\nBetween 1639 and 2005, Connecticut performed 126 executions. Twenty-four executions occurred in Connecticut Colony, prior to its statehood. The remaining 102 executions occurred after Connecticut's 1788 admission to the Union as the fifth state.[2] Contrary to popular belief, Adonijah Bailey was not the oldest person ever to be executed in Connecticut, at age 79 in 1824; instead, he was tried and sentenced to death at age 80 in January 1825 for the murder of Jeremiah W. Pollock, and hanged himself on May 24, over two weeks before he was to be executed.[3][4] The oldest person ever to be executed in Connecticut is Gershon Marx, who was hanged for murder at the age of 73, on May 18, 1905.[5]\nAfter Furman v. Georgia, Connecticut reinstated the death penalty on January 10, 1973.[6] Lethal injection became the method mandated to execute condemned prisoners, replacing the electric chair, which had not been used since Taborsky's execution in 1960.[citation needed]\n",

His nicknames came from his ability to pose as a member of the wealthy elite, which allowed him to fool potential victims and avoid scrutiny from investigators. Chapman was the first criminal to be dubbed \"Public Enemy Number One\" by the press.[1]\nGerald Chapman was born George Chartres in August 1887 to parents of Irish heritage.[2] Arrested for the first time in 1902 at age fourteen, Chapman was incarcerated for most of his early adult life.[3] While serving time for bank robbery, he was transferred from Sing Sing to Auburn State Prison, and became acquainted with highly educated Danish-born con man George \"Dutch\" Anderson in 1908.[4] With Anderson as his mentor, Chapman became a voracious reader and a self-styled gentleman, often affecting a British accent. Following both men's paroles in 1919, they began bootlegging operations in Toledo, Miami and New York City over the next two years.\nIn late 1921, along with former Auburn inmate Charles Loeber, Chapman and Anderson began committing armed robberies. On October 24,[5] the three men forced a U.S. Mail truck to stop at gunpoint on Leonard Street, successfully taking $2.4 million in cash, bonds and jewelry. Their identities were unknown to the police for months, and Chapman lived the life of an aristocrat, residing with his mistress in New York's fashionable Gramercy Park neighborhood. The three men were eventually arrested by United States Postal Inspectors William Doran, Jim Doyle and William Cochraine on July 3, 1922, after Chapman attempted to sell Argentine gold notes (stolen during the Leonard Street mail robbery) to an undercover postal inspector posing as a stock broker.[6] Chapman made headlines when he briefly got away from his interrogators at police headquarters, but he was caught before he could leave the building.\n",

The angle of the building has a 3-story tower, at the top of which sat the electric telegraph operator.  The two 90-foot (27-meter) wings of the building were occupied by the two railroad companies. The first floor of the station had a large restaurant that was especially important before the development of the dining car. Eventually, both the Central New England and the Housatonic Railroad became a part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The New Haven was later merged into the Penn Central Transportation.[2]\nThe station had been a junction and transfer point for passengers shifting from north-south NYNHH trains (Berkshire Division) to east-west CNE trains (mainline: Campbell Hall to Springfield and Hartford). Passenger service on the CNE line through the station ended in 1927 when the NYNHH acquired the CNE.[3]\n",

He produced some of the earliest full color newspaper comic strips, and was one of the first producers of regular political cartoons in American daily papers.[1][2] His satirical cartoons, published in outlets such as the New York World and The North American, were influential in the 1884 U.S. presidential election, and soon after political cartoons became a fixture in American papers. He also drew children's comic strips, including Queer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz written by L. Frank Baum, and has been called the first syndicated cartoonist for his contributions to the weekly columns of humorist Bill Nye. His books include The Hidden City (1891) and The Rambillicus Book (1903).\nWalter Hugh McDougall was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of John Alexander McDougall (1810\u20131894),[3] a painter and close associate of writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and Washington Irving.[4] Walt attended a military academy, and from the age of 16 was self-educated. He began his professional work in 1876 with the New York Daily Graphic, which three years earlier had become the nation's first illustrated daily newspaper. He also sold early works to Harper's Weekly and Puck.[5][6] For a time he was part owner of the Newark newspaper The Suburban.[7] He married Mary F. Burns in 1878.[6][8]\nHe began working for the New York World in 1884, and a cartoon printed on August 10 of that year became the World's first political cartoon.[9] Several of his cartoons were influential in the 1884 presidential election. One, likening nominee James G. Blaine's dinner with millionaires and plutocrats shortly before the election to Belshazzar's feast of the Bible, is credited with contributing to Blaine's narrow loss to Grover Cleveland. The cartoon, entitled \"The Royal Feast of Belshazzar Blaine and the Money Kings\" and co-drawn by Valerian Gribayedoff, was reprinted on billboards across New York and Blaine lost the state, and thus the election, by little over 1,000 votes.[10] Author Michael R. Smith writes McDougall and Gribayedoff \"may have created the most influential political cartoon in United States history.\"[11] \"Belshazzar Blaine and the Money Kings\" elevated the prominence of political cartoons, which soon after became a regular feature in daily newspapers nationwide.[12][13][14]\n",

Various conspiracy theorists have claimed, for example, that the massacre was actually orchestrated by the U.S. government as part of an elaborate plot to promote stricter gun control laws.[2]\nThe more common conspiracy theory, adopted initially by James H. Fetzer, James Tracy, and others, and further popularized by Alex Jones, denied that the massacre actually occurred, asserting that it was faked. The massacre was described by Fetzer and Tracy as a classified training exercise involving members of federal and local law enforcement, the news media, and crisis actors, which they claim was modeled on Operation Closed Campus, an Iowa school-shooting drill that was canceled in 2011 amid threats and public outcry. Jones described the shooting incident as \"synthetic, completely fake with actors; in my view, manufactured [...] it just shows how bold they are that they clearly used actors.\"[3][4]\nNo evidence supports the conspiracy theories, which make a number of implausible claims.[5][6][7] Moreover, many Sandy Hook conspiracy theories contradict one another.[6] A number of sources have published articles debunking various claims put forward by conspiracy theorists.[6][8][9][10] In 2018, the parents of several children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Jones and other authors of conspiracy videos for defamation, accusing them of engaging in a campaign of \"false, cruel, and dangerous assertions\".[11] In 2019, Jones reversed his stance and stated that the massacre was real.[12]\n",

Authorities suspect that she was killed in a violent attack at her home in New Canaan, Connecticut. Her husband, Fotis Dulos, and his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, were arrested on charges of tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution in connection with Jennifer's disappearance. Later, the two \u2013 along with Fotis' attorney Kent Mawhinney \u2013 faced additional charges related to Jennifer's murder. Fotis died by suicide in January 2020. As of June\u00a02022[update], neither Troconis nor Mawhinney have had their day in court, so none of the accused have yet been proven guilty.[1]\nJennifer and Fotis were in the midst of both a contentious divorce and child-custody proceedings.[2] Police suspect that Fotis had been lying in wait for Jennifer and attacked her when she arrived at her home, after dropping her children off at school. Police allege that he and Troconis drove to Hartford to dispose of garbage bags containing items with Jennifer's blood on them on the night that Jennifer disappeared. Police further allege that Mawhinney conspired with Fotis and Troconis. If convicted, they will spend life behind bars.\n",

Her death led to the state of Connecticut's first murder conviction without the victim's body.[1][2]\nHelle Nielsen married Richard Crafts in 1975 and settled with him in Newtown, Connecticut, United States. Helle continued working as a flight attendant while raising their three children. In 1986, Helle began to suspect that Richard was engaged in extramarital sexual activity, and confronted him about suspicious long-distance phone calls, which angered Richard.[3] Helle met with a divorce attorney and hired a private investigator, Keith Mayo, who snapped photos of Richard kissing another flight attendant outside her New Jersey residence.[3]\nOn November 18, 1986, friends dropped Helle off at the couple's Newtown residence after she had worked a long flight from Frankfurt, West Germany. She was never seen again. That night, a snowstorm hit the area. The next morning, Richard said he was taking Helle and their children to his sister's house in Westport. When he arrived, Helle was not with him. Over the next few weeks, Richard gave Helle's friends a variety of stories as to why they were unable to reach her: that she was visiting her mother in Denmark, that she was visiting the Canary Islands with a friend, or that he simply did not know her whereabouts.[4] Helle's friends were aware that Richard had a volatile temper and grew concerned. Helle had told some of them, \"If something happens to me, don't assume it was an accident.\"[5][6] On December 1, the private investigator Keith Mayo reported her missing to the Newtown Police.[3] Richard Crafts was known to local law enforcement for his work as a volunteer police officer in Newtown, and in 1986 Crafts was working as a part-time police officer in the nearby town of Brookfield.[7] According to Mayo, Newtown Police initially dismissed his concerns, saying that Helle would probably return.[3]\n",

The city of New Haven and Yale University have offered a combined $150,000 for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of Jovin's killer.[1] The crime remains unsolved. At Yale, Jovin volunteered as a tutor through the Yale Tutoring in Elementary Schools program, sang in both the Freshman Chorus and the Bach Society Orchestra, co-founded the German Club, and worked for three years in the Davenport dining hall.[2]\nAfter dropping off the penultimate draft of her senior essay on the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, at approximately 4:15 pm on Friday December 4, 1998, Suzanne Jovin began preparations for a pizza-making party she had organized at the Trinity Lutheran Church on 292 Orange Street for the local chapter of Best Buddies, an international organization that brings together students and mentally disabled adults. By 8:30 pm, after staying late to help clean up, she was driving another volunteer home in a borrowed university station wagon. Around 8:45, she returned the car to the Yale-owned lot on the corner of Edgewood Avenue and Howe Street, and proceeded to walk two blocks to her second-floor apartment at 258 Park Street, upstairs from a Yale police substation.\nSometime prior to 8:50 pm, a few friends passed by Jovin's window and asked her if she wanted to join them at the movies. Jovin declined, stating that she planned to do school work that night. At 9:02, Jovin logged onto her Yale e-mail account and told a female friend in German she was going to leave some GRE books for her in Jovin's apartment building's lobby, once she had retrieved them from an unnamed person who had borrowed them from her. She also provided the access code for her door. This unnamed person has never been identified.[3] Whether Jovin met this unnamed person that night remains unknown. At 9:10, she logged off. If she made or received any calls is unknown; calls within Yale's telephone system were not traceable. She wore the same soft, low-cut hiking boots, jeans, and maroon fleece pullover she had worn at the pizza party.[2]\n",

He was also previously convicted of the 1983 killing of his former girlfriend Karen Osmun and the 1987 attack on Mary Ellen Renard. Snelgrove is incarcerated at the Cheshire Correctional Institution in Cheshire, Connecticut. He is scheduled for release October 14, 2063, when he will be 103 years old.[1]\nIn 1983, the 23-year-old Snelgrove had previously been dating Karen Osmun from New Brunswick, New Jersey, also 23.[2] Karen was a graduate student at Rutgers University, studying computers. On December 24, 1983, Karen was reported missing by her parents after she failed to show up at their home for dinner in Bricktown, New Jersey. The next day, her body was found in her apartment on her bedroom floor. She had been stabbed with a knife several times to death. She was also strangled.[3] Karen's ex-boyfriend, Ned Snelgrove, was the prime suspect in her murder, but was not charged until several years later, after attacking another New Jersey woman. In 1988, Snelgrove wrote \"I could not stop my hands from squeezing her throat as hard as I could\" about killing Karen Osmun.[2]\nIn August 1987, Snelgrove encountered a 44-year-old divorcee named Mary Ellen Renard at a New Jersey nightclub. Snelgrove and Mary Ellen conversed over the course of the night. Snelgrove had told Mary Ellen that he was a recent Rutgers graduate working at HP. At the end of the night, when Mary Ellen was preparing to leave, her car would not start. Snelgrove helped her get her car started, and offered to follow her home to make sure she arrived there safely. When they got back to Mary Ellen's Elmwood Park, New Jersey apartment, Snelgrove asked to use her bathroom, so she let him in. After getting into Mary Ellen's apartment, Snelgrove sexually assaulted and stabbed her several times. Mary Ellen fought back and was able to get into the apartment below her, whose owner called the police. Mary Ellen survived the attack, and was able to identify Snelgrove as her attacker. He was later apprehended and charged.[4] Snelgrove wrote the following in a 1992 letter about the assault on Mary Ellen Renard: \"I botched it up. She didn't die. If she had died, my name wouldn't have even made the suspect list\".[2]\n",

All charges stemmed from the murder of 19-year-old Alex Rackley in the early hours of May 21, 1969.  The trials became a rallying-point for the American Left, and marked a decline in public support, even among the black community, for the Black Panther Party.\nOn May 17, 1969, members of the Black Panther Party kidnapped fellow Panther Alex Rackley, who had fallen under suspicion of informing for the FBI.  He was held captive at the New Haven Panther headquarters on Orchard Street, where he was tortured and interrogated until he confessed. His interrogation was tape recorded by the Panthers.[2]  During that time, national party chairman Bobby Seale visited New Haven and spoke on the campus of Yale University for the Yale Black Ensemble Theater Company.[3]  The prosecution alleged, but Seale denied, that after his speech, Seale briefly stopped by the headquarters where Rackley was being held captive and ordered that Rackley be executed.\nEarly in the morning of May 21, three Panthers \u2013 Warren Kimbro, Lonnie McLucas, and George Sams, one of the Panthers who had come East from California to investigate the police infiltration of the New York Panther chapter, drove Rackley to the nearby town of Middlefield, Connecticut.  Kimbro shot Rackley once in the head and McLucas shot him once in the chest.  They dumped his corpse in a swamp, where it was discovered the next day.\nNew Haven police immediately arrested eight New Haven area Black Panthers.

She had one child, Alice Beamon (Young), born in 1640,[2] who was also condemned for the same crime thirty years later in the 1670s, but was not hanged.\nAlse Young was born in 1615 in New Windsor, Berkshire, England[1] and moved to Windsor, Connecticut during the 1630s.[1] She is believed to have been the wife of John Young,[3] who bought a small parcel of land in Windsor in 1641, sold it in 1649, and then disappeared from the town records.[4] The best evidence to suggest that John Young was her husband comes from a physician.[5] She had a daughter, Alice Young Beamon, who was accused of witchcraft in nearby Springfield, Massachusetts, some 30 years later.[4] Her daughter Alice Young Beamon married and had children with Simon Beamon.[5] Similarly to her mother, Alice Young Beamon was also accused of witchcraft but defended herself by claiming that she was being slandered.[5] Even though Alice Young was a woman without a son when the witchcraft accusation was lodged, her husband was still alive during her accusation. This makes it unlikely that she was accused simply for the possibility of inheriting her husband's estate in the future. Other reasons are more probable.\nThere is no record of Young's trial or the specifics of the charge. The same year that Alice was hanged the death rate had steadily increased.[5] The influenza affected everyone in that even wealthy people with more resources and access to medical care were dying at extremely high rates.[5] Many prominent members of the noble class and legislature lost their families.[5] Given such circumstances, a member of the elite class may have organized for someone to be hanged and scapegoated, leading to Alice's being chosen at random. She may have been hanged at the Meeting House Square in Hartford, Connecticut, now the site of the Old State House, since a jail was on the edge of the square. A journal of then Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor John Winthrop mentions \"One... of Windsor arraigned and executed at Hartford for a witch.\"[6] The second town clerk of Windsor, Matthew Grant, confirms her execution with the May 26, 1647, diary entry, \"Alse Young was hanged.\" She was roughly 32 years old when she was hanged.\n",

Racial tensions were high in the Groton and New London area from May to June, and there were several confrontations between the two groups. Black sailors reported that white sailors attacked them, and white Marines accused the black sailors of waiting for them after dark when they crossed Long Cove Bridge.[1] The police arrested two white \"Blue Jackets\", and white sailors attacked the Hotel Bristol on Bank Street where the black sailors spent most of their free time, throwing a group of blacks out of the hotel on the street and beating them. The police and fire brigades were called but could not stop the rioting. The Marine Corps were eventually called, and they regained control.[1]\nOn May 30, 1919, about 20 sailors and soldiers were arrested by police officers, marines, and firemen. The Greeneville Daily Sun reported that the trouble began when \"negro sailors\" entered the Coast Guard Academy in New London and attacked white sailors.[2] On June 29, 1919, another riot erupted which required the Marines to restore order.[3] Author Jan Voogd argues that this riot came to national attention because a fire hydrant was damaged by the marine vehicles. This caused a dispute between the submarine base and city authorities over who would pay for the damage, and so created a paper trail.[3] Voogd posits that there may have been other race riots that went \"uncounted, unobserved, and unacknowledged.\"[3]\n",

Taborsky donated his body to Yale School of Medicine, and his ashes were later buried in the garden of Christ Church Cathedral.\nTaborsky is an anomaly in Connecticut death penalty lore. He is the only convict sent to death row twice, for different crimes. Taborsky first came to Connecticut's death row for the 1950 murder of Louis Wolfson, a West Hartford liquor store owner during a robbery. His younger brother Albert, who was also his co-conspirator, testified against Taborsky at the trial in exchange for a life sentence.  In prison Albert exhibited signs of mental illness and was institutionalized.  \n",

Yanz suspected that Goering was having an affair with Yanz's wife Kitty, and went to his home in the Highwood neighborhood of Hamden, Connecticut.[3][4] Yanz, discovering his wife and Goering \"in a compromising position\",[5] took his Winchester rifle and shot Goering in the head, killing him.[6] Yanz surrendered himself to police the same afternoon.[3]\nYanz was arraigned June 22, and held without bail.[7] He initially claimed that he did not realize the person he was shooting was Goering, and that he initially believed he was protecting his wife against a rapist. Public opinion at the time was that he was claiming this to defend his wife's reputation.[5] Yanz was indicted for murder by the grand jury, and his case was deferred to October.[8] The trial began the second week of October,[9] with closing arguments held the morning of October 17.[10] That afternoon, the jury found Yanz guilty of second degree murder after two hours of deliberation, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.[11]\n",

His address at the conclusion of that year's commencement exercises was \"witty, pathetic, and full of clever allusions\" according to the New York Times. \"Bouquets fell at his feet by the score as he bowed his way off the stage.\"[1] Upon graduation, he immediately joined the faculty as a Latin tutor, becoming a professor in 1888.[2] He was among several faculty members appointed to newly created chairs when he became Anthon Professor of Latin Language and Literature at the celebration of the 150th anniversary of Columbia's founding in 1904.[3]\nPeck also wrote travel guides and produced translations and works for children under a number of pseudonyms, and he was a frequent and forceful contributor to magazines and newspapers. He was editor in chief of Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities and editor of the Students' Series of Latin Classics and Columbia University Studies in Classical Philology. He served as the first editor in chief of The Bookman magazine, worked on its staff from 1895 to 1906, and created America's first best-seller list for its pages in 1895. He was also editor in chief of the International Cyclopaedia from 1890 to 1901 and co-editor of the first edition of the New International Encyclopedia (1902\u20131904).  In 1906 he published a nearly 800-page monument of progressive historiography, Twenty Years of the Republic 1885-1905, expansive, dense with detail and reference, penetrating, scathing in its revelations of actual social, economic and political conditions.

The massacre was described by Fetzer and Tracy as a classified training exercise involving members of federal and local law enforcement, the news media, and crisis actors, which they claim was modeled on Operation Closed Campus, an Iowa school-shooting drill that was canceled in 2011 amid threats and public outcry. Jones described the shooting incident as \"synthetic, completely fake with actors; in my view, manufactured [...] it just shows how bold they are that they clearly used actors.\"[3][4]\nNo evidence supports the conspiracy theories, which make a number of implausible claims.[5][6][7] Moreover, many Sandy Hook conspiracy theories contradict one another.[6] A number of sources have published articles debunking various claims put forward by conspiracy theorists.[6][8][9][10] In 2018, the parents of several children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Jones and other authors of conspiracy videos for defamation, accusing them of engaging in a campaign of \"false, cruel, and dangerous assertions\".[11] In 2019, Jones reversed his stance and stated that the massacre was real.[12]\n",

He previously was a candidate in the 2020 elections for Connecticut state senator for the 28th district,[4] dropping out before the August primaries[5] to work on a national campaign. He is the older brother of first grade student Jesse Lewis,[6] a victim of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.[7]\nJT Lewis was born Joseph Theodore Lewis on May 18, 2000,[1] to Scarlett Lewis.[8] He is the older brother of six-year-old Jesse Lewis,[9] who was a first grade student at Sandy Hook Elementary School when he and others were killed in a shooting at the school on December 14, 2012.[10] He was a twelve-year-old seventh grade student when his brother died.[11] Lewis was raised on a farm with his younger brother and they had horses, dogs, and chickens, which their mother bought in 1998.[12] Several days after the shooting, former president Barack Obama met with Lewis, his mother, and the victims' families at Newtown High School.[13] Lewis recalled the event years later saying that \"President Obama treated me with the utmost respect and class. More importantly, [he] honored my brother\u2019s memory.\"[14] Lewis attended Newtown High School and was on the varsity football team, graduating in 2018.[15] \nLewis currently attends University of Connecticut as a political science major.[11] He played on the UConn football team as a walk-on kicker his Freshman year.[16]\nAfter the shooting, Lewis became an advocate for trauma victims and founded the organization Newtown Helps Rwanda, which raises money for relatives of the victims of the 1994 Rwanda genocide to attend college and also participates in other causes.[11] Survivors of the genocide reached out to Lewis via Skype to talk about their traumatic experiences losing family members due to violence and offer their condolences to him.[17] As a gesture of gratitude to the survivors, Lewis founded the organization to raise money for their education.[18] After a few months of fundraising, the organization raised enough money to send several survivors to college and have raised over $35,000.[17] Lewis's organization also helped Ugandan former child soldiers build fishponds and poultry farms for self-sufficiency.[18] The organization has expanded its focus to several causes to help victims of trauma, such as victims and survivors of automobile accidents. He has also interned for the non-profit organization Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement, which his mother founded.[18] Lewis co-won the Courage Award at the 2016 Teen Choice Awards for his advocacy work.[19] The award was presented to him by singer Ne-Yo and actress Jessica Alba.

        "paragraph": "George Spencer (c. 1600 \u2013 April 8, 1642) was the second person in history to be executed in Connecticut. He was executed by hanging for charges of sodomy after being wrongfully convicted for an alleged sexual act with an animal, in which it was erroneously claimed that Spencer had fathered a female pig's offspring. His hanging was the first wrongful execution in Connecticut's history.\nAfter a review of the case in 2015, Spencer was given a posthumous pardon by Superior Court Judge John C. Blue, concluding that Spencer's confession was coerced and thus inadmissible, while also stating that Spencer's alleged crime of fathering a piglet was \"biologically impossible\". Spencer's case was described by Blue as the \"first verifiable false confession in American history\".[1]\nGeorge Spencer is described as an ugly, balding servant with a glass eye.[2][3]  He is believed to have lived for a time in Boston and while there was found guilty of receiving stolen goods.[2]  His punishment was a flogging. He then moved to the New Haven Colony,[2] and continued to be a \"habitual troublemaker\".[3]  He was open about his lack of faith, never praying in the years of being in Connecticut and only reading the Bible when forced to by his master.[2][4]\n",

The location of the crime was a warehouse owned by Hartford Distributors, a beer distribution company. The gunman, former employee Omar Sheriff Thornton (born April 25, 1976)[1] shot and killed eight male coworkers before turning a gun on himself.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8][excessive citations]\nThornton, aged 34, was called into his place of employment for disciplinary purposes. Thornton had been recorded on surveillance video in the Hartford Distributors warehouse stealing beer on a previous occasion. He was also implicated in the theft of empty beer kegs.[9] Hartford Distributors is a wholesale distributor of Budweiser beer products and wine. Given the options of being fired or resigning, Thornton signed the resignation papers and was being escorted out of the building. Instead of leaving, he took a Ruger SR9 semi-automatic pistol from his lunchbox and opened fire.\n",

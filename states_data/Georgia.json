Hall had allegedly stolen a tire, and was alleged to have tried to fight back against Screws and two of his deputies during the arrest.[2]  Hall was arrested at his home.[3] Screws then beat Hall to death.\nThe local U.S. attorney then convened a grand jury which indicted Screws on charges of violating Hall's civil rights. Screws was then convicted at the federal court house in Albany, Georgia. The conviction was upheld by the Circuit Court and then appealed to the Supreme Court. While the case was moving through the courts Screws was reelected as sheriff by a very wide margin.\n",

        "paragraph": "The Augusta Riot was a collective rebellion of Black citizens in Augusta, Georgia, and the largest urban uprising in the Deep South during the Civil Rights era. Fueled by long-simmering grievances about racial injustice, it was sparked by White officials\u2019 stonewalling in the face of Black citizens\u2019 demand for answers about the beating death of Black teenager Charles Oatman. At its height on the evening of May 11, 1970, two to three thousand people participated, ransacking and setting fire to White- and Chinese-American-owned businesses, damaging $1 million of property over a 130-block area.[1]  White police officers violently suppressed the riot, with the endorsement of Georgia governor Lester Maddox, shoot-to-kill orders from their captain, and reinforcements by the National Guard and State Patrol. Despite the suppression, the riot fundamentally shook the status quo, galvanizing a new wave of activism that opened economic and political doors for Augusta\u2019s Black citizens.\nPolice brutality and severe poverty were deeply woven into the fabric of White supremacy in Augusta, and they showed no signs of weakening as a new decade dawned.[2]  Augusta\u2019s Black organizations had different visions for bringing change: NAACP and SCLC chapters sought to expand on gains of the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Panther Party chapter and a cadre of Paine College students embraced the militancy and self-assertion of Black Power, and the Committee of Ten embodied a middle way, with a militant style but a focus on confronting White officials. Simmering tensions came to a head on the evening of May 9, when news began to circulate that Charles Oatman had been beaten to death in the county jail. The 16-year-old was a popular student at A.R. Johnson Junior High School. He was also mentally challenged. In a grim accident in late March, Oatman had fatally wounded his young niece in the kitchen of his family\u2019s small house, but White authorities charged him with killing her and incarcerated him. Over the course of several weeks in the jail, he was brutally tortured and beaten, ultimately dying of his injuries. His badly mutilated body, with cigarette burns, marks from a fork, and a deep gash in the back of his head, was brought from the jail to University Hospital and then to Mays Mortuary on May 9.[3]\nThe news sent shock waves through Augusta\u2019s Black community. The common anguish and rage had a unifying effect across lines of division, and Black citizens quickly mobilized. On the evening of May 10 several hundred demonstrated at the county jail, demanding answers from White officials but making little headway. Sheriff\u2019s deputies were on hand (and on the jail\u2019s roof) with weapons drawn.[4]  On the afternoon of May 11 an even larger group demonstrated in front of the Municipal Building, and again they were confronted by shotgun-wielding police officers. When the news emerged that the sheriff had concluded his brief, tacit investigation and charged two Black teenagers with manslaughter, many were indignant to the point of rage. To the militants this was \u201cwarfare\u201d and had to be met with violence.[5]  They moved to Broad Street, roughing up window displays at White-owned stores, then moved to the heart of the Black neighborhood at 9th and Gwinnett Streets (today\u2019s James Brown and Laney-Walker Boulevards). Reorganizing and with increased numbers\u2014younger people and \u201cplain neighborhood people\u201d (working-class people intimately familiar with poverty and police brutality)\u2014they began to ransack White- and Chinese-American-owned stores and to attack White motorists. As night fell, they began targeted acts of firebombing against White-owned stores, warehouses, and wholesale dealerships. The businesses of White and Chinese-American merchants known to do right by their Black customers were not damaged\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t touch him, he\u2019s a Soul Brother\u201d was the word about such merchants.[6]\n",

His trial, conviction, and appeals attracted national attention. His lynching two years later, in response to the commutation of his death sentence, became the focus of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding antisemitism. Today, the consensus of researchers is that Frank was wrongly convicted and Jim Conley was likely the actual murderer.\nBorn to a Jewish-American family in Texas, Frank was raised in New York and earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University before moving to Atlanta in 1908. Marrying in 1910, he involved himself with the city's Jewish community and was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization, in 1912. At that time, there were growing concerns regarding child labor at factories. One of these children was Mary Phagan, who worked at the National Pencil Company where Frank was director. The girl was strangled on April 26, 1913, and found dead in the factory's cellar the next morning. Two notes, made to look as if she had written them, were found beside her body. Based on the mention of a \"night witch\", they implicated the night watchman, Newt Lee. Over the course of their investigations, the police arrested several men, including Lee, Frank, and Jim Conley, a janitor at the factory.\n",

African Americans had been given the right to vote in Georgia's 1868 state constitution, which had passed in April, and in the months that followed, whites across the state used violence to combat their newfound political strength, often through the newly founded Ku Klux Klan. Georgia agents of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau recorded 336 cases of murder or assault with intent to kill against freedmen from January 1 through November 15.[1]\nThe massacre followed the expulsion of the Original 33 black members of the Georgia General Assembly earlier that month. Among those expelled was southwest Georgia representative Philip Joiner. On September 19, Joiner led a twenty-five-mile march of several hundred blacks (freedmen), as well as a few whites, from Albany, Georgia, to Camilla, the Mitchell County seat, to attend a Republican political rally on the courthouse square.[2] Estimates of the number of participants range from 150[3] to 300.[4]\nThe local sheriff and \"citizens committee\" in the majority-white town warned the black and white activists that they would be met with violence, and demanded that they surrender their guns, even though carrying weapons was legal and customary at the time.[4] The marchers refused to give up their guns and continued to the courthouse square, where a group of local whites, quickly deputized by the sheriff, fired upon them. This assault forced the Republicans and freedmen to retreat into the swamps as locals gave chase, killing an estimated nine to fifteen of the black rally participants while wounding forty others. \"Whites proceeded through the countryside over the next two weeks, beating and warning Negroes that they would be killed if they tried to vote in the coming election.\"[4] The Camilla Massacre was the culmination of smaller acts of anti-Black violence committed by white inhabitants that had plagued southwest Georgia since the end of the Civil War.[3]:\u200a1\u20132\u200a\n",

The protests primarily centered around Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta, where several hundred protesters gathered on the first night, though other sights that saw extensive protesting included the Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta City Hall, and the Georgia Governor's Mansion, among other places. On the first day, protesting was primarily peaceful in nature until later in the evening, when the situation became more violent. Protesters and police clashed throughout the night as several buildings and vehicles around the Centennial Olympic Park area were damaged or vandalized. Of particular note, the CNN Center (headquarters of the international news channel CNN) was the site of extensive fighting between police stationed inside the building and protesters outside. During the night, then Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms declared a state of emergency and Georgia Governor Brian Kemp activated the Georgia National Guard; over a thousand troops deployed to Atlanta the next day. The following day, Mayor Bottoms instated a 9 p.m. curfew. The next few days would follow a similar pattern to the first, with protests during the day becoming more intense into the night. Several hundred protesters were arrested during the first several nights of protests, June 5 being the first night since the protests began that no protesters were arrested.\n",

Wilson was the 1,500th person to be executed in the United States since capital punishment was resumed in 1976.[1][2][3]\nParks was born in 1971 in Milledgeville, Georgia. At the time of his murder, he was working two jobs, one as a prison guard and the other at a Winn-Dixie grocery store. He was trying to make money to study to become a prison counselor. According to his brother, Parks wanted to help inmates facing long prison sentences, as well as inmates who were getting ready to transition back into society. In 1995, Parks' mother died, and less than six months later, the family home caught fire. Following the fire, Parks' brother moved out of Milledgeville and joined the Army.[4]\nWilson was born in 1976 and was physically abused by his grandfather and his mother's boyfriends as a child.[5] On January 31, 1989, Wilson and two other boys started a fire at an apartment in Glynn County while the residents were home.[5] On December 16, 1991, Wilson shot Jose Luis Valle, a Mexican migrant worker. According to three youths who were with Wilson, he said he was going to rob Valle and \"wanted to see what it felt like to shoot somebody.\" When Valle left the store, Wilson approached him and drew a pistol. When Valle raised his hands in surrender and tried to run, Wilson shot him in the buttocks. He later threatened a witness who gave a statement to the police. The charges against Wilson did not go to trial when the authorities failed to locate Valle after he was discharged from the hospital. While in a juvenile detention center, he assaulted a youth worker.[5]\n",

He was a chief of Coweta town and commander of a mounted police force. He became a large-scale planter, built and managed a successful inn, and operated a commercial ferry business. Early American historians attributed McIntosh's achievements and influence to his mixed race Scots/European ancestry. Since the late 20th century, historians have argued much of McIntosh's political influence stemmed more from his Creek upbringing and cultural standing, particularly his mother's prominent Wind Clan in the Creek matrilineal system, and to other aspects of Creek culture.[2]\nBecause McIntosh led a group that negotiated and signed the Treaty of Indian Springs in February 1825, which ceded much of remaining Creek lands to the United States in violation of Creek law, for the first time the Creek National Council ordered that a Creek be executed for crimes against the Nation.[3] It sentenced him and other signatories to death. McIntosh was executed by his long-time political nemesis Menawa and a large force of Law Menders in late April 1825.  Two other signatories were executed and another, while McIntosh's son Chilly was shot at, but escaped unharmed.  Menawa signed a treaty in 1826 that was very similar in both language and benefits, but one which the Creek National Council had agreed to and was therefore considered a legitimate treaty according to contemporary Creek law.\nThe vast majority of Chief McIntosh's descendants voluntarily moved to Indian Territory in modern-day Oklahoma prior to forced federal government removals via the Trail of Tears, which began in 1831. Two of Chief McIntosh's sons, Chilly & Daniel, served as Confederate officers during the American Civil War. Daughter Kate & her family became pre-statehood pioneers of the Florida Panhandle.  Daughters Rebecca and Delilah moved to East Texas with their husbands, developing plantations there. Rebecca McIntosh Hawkins Hagerty married again after her first husband died young, and by 1860 was the wealthiest woman in Texas, owning three plantations with a total of 12,800 acres and 120 slaves.[4][5]\n",

The ship ran blockades and brought 409 surviving slaves from the Congo to the United States for sale. The ship was later impounded. Although Lamar and numerous other defendants were prosecuted, none was convicted of any crime. This was the penultimate slave ship known to have brought in slaves before the Civil War, and the last with a large cargo. The last was Clotilda, which brought 110 slaves to Mobile, Alabama, on July 9, 1860.\nBorn and raised in Savannah, Georgia, Lamar was the son of businessman and banker Gazaway Bugg Lamar and Jane Meek Cresswell of that city. His mother and all five of his siblings, plus a niece, were lost in the June 1838 explosion and wreck of the steamship Pulaski, when two-thirds of the passengers died. He and his father were among the 59 who survived the sinking.[1]\nDuring the Civil War, Lamar initially organized and commanded the 7th Georgia Battalion. After it was merged with the 61st Georgia Infantry, he returned to civilian life. He worked with his father in the Importing and Exporting Company of Georgia, which supported blockade runners to keep open trade between the Confederacy and the North, as well as having extensive trade relations with England and France. Toward the end of the war, Lamar returned to military service and held the rank of Colonel. He was the last Confederate killed in the Civil War, at the Battle of Columbus.[2]\n",

During the argument, Hansford, of whom Williams had been a sexual partner for about two years,[1] pushed over an 18th-century English grandfather clock. Williams was in his study at the time, and Hansford soon entered, whereupon he drew a gun on Williams. The gun jammed upon firing, however, and Williams pulled a 9mm Luger pistol from his desk and shot Hansford in what he claimed was self-defense.[3][4] Prosecutors claimed Williams then proceeded to stage the crime scene to make it appear as if Hansford had actually fired at him.[4] Williams called the police at 3:00 A.M. to report the shooting, just over half an hour after the incident occurred. He was taken into custody and charged with murder. Superior Court Judge Eugene H. Gadsden set Williams' bond at $25,000, which he soon posted.[5]\n",

They were pulled from street cars and attacked on the street; white mobs invaded black neighborhoods, destroying homes and businesses.\nThe immediate catalyst was newspaper reports of four white women raped in separate incidents, allegedly by African American men. A grand jury later indicted two African Americans for raping Ethel Lawrence and her aunt. An underlying cause was the growing racial tension in a rapidly-changing city and economy, competition for jobs, housing, and political power.\n",

The Womacks divorced when Lynn was five, after which Helen Womack took custody of Lynn. Shortly afterwards, Helen Womack married again, and Lynn did not get on well with her new stepfather, D.L. Gregory. As a teenager, Lynn took to substance abuse and was admitted to a clinic in Atlanta for drug problems.\nBy the 1990s, Lynn Womack was working as a 911 dispatcher for Cobb County, Georgia.

Tusan granted a stay on Hill's execution, on the basis that the secrecy law violated the First Amendment by concealing information \"essential to the determination of the efficacy and potency of lethal injection drugs\" from the public.[6] The state appealed this ruling, and in May 2014, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the secrecy law.[7] On February 2, 2016, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a request from Brandon Astor Jones' lawyers that his execution be stayed on the basis that he had waited too long to request such a stay.

The Summer consisted of terrorist attacks on black communities, and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Massacre in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed.

He became the first person to be executed in Georgia since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated.[1]\nIn 1956, shortly after graduating from high school, Rebecca Turpin married Joseph Ronald Akins, a technician and an engineer who worked for Southern Natural Gas.[2] They had three daughters together by 1960. In 1973, Akins accused his wife of trying to murder him, leading to their divorce by the next year. Akins remarried to Juanita Knight, an elementary schoolteacher.[3]\nSubsequent to the divorce, Rebecca relocated to North Miami Beach, Florida, with her daughters, where she met John Eldon Smith, an insurance salesman who was also a native of Miami.[4] The two of them were soon married. Subsequently, Smith adopted the moniker 'Anthony Isalldo Machetti' (often shortened to Tony Machetti)[5] because his wife thought the name had a 'mafia' ring to it. Rebecca changed her own name to Rebecca Akins Smith Machetti. Smith and his wife Rebecca had aspirations of living a life of luxury in North Miami Beach, with Smith adopting an identity as a hitman to fund the lifestyle.[6]\n",

Pace was convicted of four murders, but was not tried for a fifth, receiving a death sentence for his crimes.[1]\nThe first victim was 86-year-old Lula Bell McAfee, an elderly lady living at 321 Simon St. S.E in southeast Atlanta. A boarder found her nude body in the kneeling position on the bed, sexually assaulted and strangled with a combination of her bra and a rag.[2] Police theorized that she had been killed between the early evening of August 27, 1988, and the early morning of the following day.[3]\nNot long after, she was followed by 78-year-old Mattie Mae McClendon on September 10, 1988, who lived near the Atlanta University Center and was found dead in her apartment by her sister. She was facing the pillow.[2] Although McClendon showed no signs of foul play, detectives still decided to investigate it as a homicide, as a window in her home had been broken. Her death was investigated alongside that of Lillian Lawrence, another older woman who died under mysterious circumstances, but the deaths were later determined to be unrelated.[4] The official cause was later determined to be asphyxiation by suffocation.[2]\n",

Charles Blackman, an African-American man, was tried and convicted for the murder in three trials by all-white, \"gentleman\" juries. The Georgia Supreme Court twice granted Blackman a new trial, but he was convicted and sentenced to hang a third time in September 1888. Blackman was twice granted respite by Georgia Governor John Brown Gordon after the third trial, which delayed Blackman\u2019s execution by three months. Blackman maintained his innocence until his public execution and insisted that he was never given an impartial trial. 5,000 people from across South Georgia travelled to Ellaville, a town of a few hundreds, to witness the hanging. Telegraph wires were cut to ensure that messages from Governor Gordon and other state officials would not be transmitted and interfere with the hanging.\nStonewall Tondee was the 22-year-old son of the Treasurer of Schley County, Georgia, and worked as a store clerk in Ellaville. Late in the evening on Saturday September 5, 1885, Tondee was waiting on customers in the store when someone outside in a cotton patch shot him through the window with a shotgun.[1] Patrons in the store called out for help, and a doctor reached him five minutes after the shooting. Tondee died three minutes after the doctor arrived. A crowd soon assembled to consider who killed Tondee, a \u201cuniversal favorite\u201d of the town. Suspicion fell on Charles Blackman, who supposedly was \u201cjealous of Mr. Tondee about a negro woman\u201d and \u201chad made threats against him.\u201d Witnesses reported to have seen Blackman in Ellaville on Saturday night and travelling to Americus Sunday morning, but Blackman\u2019s brother claimed Blackman spent Saturday night in his home near Americus. Though residents of Ellaville discussed letting \u201cJudge Lynch\u201d decide Blackman\u2019s fate, prominent figures in the town advocated letting the law take its course.[2]\nShortly after the murder of Stonewall Tondee, Charles Blackman was convicted by a coroner's jury and was sent out of Ellaville to the Sumter County Jail out of concern that a mob would abduct and lynch Blackman. Blackman had no counsel so the judge appointed lawyers to defend him. On the day of the first trial, October 3, 1885, a reporter wrote that the Ellaville courthouse was \"packed from foundation to ceiling with the wealth, the chivalry, the intelligence, the rags, the depravity, and the filth of the county.\" Witnesses gave testimonies regarding sightings of Blackman on the day of the murder, threats Blackman made against Tondee, and the path taken by the murderer of Tondee after fleeing the scene of the crime. The arguments then began and lasted well into the evening, with Blackman's counsel arguing that the evidence was circumstantial and inconclusive. The next morning, the jury delivered its verdict that Blackman was guilty, and the judge sentenced Blackman to hang on November 6, 1885.[3]\n",

Presley fully admitted his guilt, and as a result of a plea agreement, he was given several terms of life imprisonment without parole.[1]\nAeman Presley was born in 1980, in Chicago, Illinois.[2] Soon after his birth, his father abandoned the family. In 1992, he joined a gang associated with the Folk Nation and began committing small-time offenses. In order to change this unhealthy lifestyle, Presley and his mother left Chicago in 1995, moving to Stone Mountain, Georgia, a small town with a population of about 6,000. There, Aeman attended the local Stone Mountain High School. In December 1995, as part of a journalistic investigation into the life of juvenile delinquents in the state, Presley, along with several other teens, gave an interview to the TimesDaily, describing his experience as a former gang member.[3][4]\nAfter graduating high school, he joined the Georgia National Guard, but was fired in the early 2000s, returning to his mother's home in Stone Mountain, where he worked low-skilled labour-intensive jobs. Presley began to exhibit antisocial and violent behavior, developing a drug addiction as well. In December 2002, he was fired from Carmike Cinemas after repeatedly threatening visitors and co-workers alike. In the immediate aftermath, he threatened to kill his former supervisor, who called the police. Aeman was arrested, but avoided prison time, and was instead given a fine and compulsory anger management courses, which he attended for the next several months. \n",

A day laborer, Hunter raped and killed four elderly women in Atlanta between March and April 1986, robbing their apartments afterwards. He later pleaded guilty to the murders and numerous robberies, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.[1]\nThe first victim was 85-year-old Annie Rochelle Copeland, who lived alone in a small apartment in southwest Atlanta. She was found by a neighbor, a minister, on March 1, 1986, who got worried after knocking on the door and receiving no reply. She was found lying on her bed in the fetal position, covered with a bedspread and blanket, and her face covered by a pillow and her blue nightgown. The apartment had been turned upside down, with items from a pocketbook strewn about and a bloody pillowcase placed between her legs. The perpetrator had managed to enter by cutting the screen of a living room window and pulling out the windowpane.[2] The killing scared other elderly residents living near Clark University, who took additional measures to protect themselves in case the perpetrator struck again.[3]\nOnly a few days later, on March 6, 25-year-old Felton Clements went to check on his 61-year-old mother Aretha, who lived alone in northwest Atlanta, only to find her dead and her apartment ransacked. Mrs. Clements had been manually strangled and then wrapped up in her bedspread, nightgown disarranged, her head put against the foot of the bed and her right leg beneath her. Her plants had been overturned, her drawers emptied, with the killer then stealing her 25-inch color TV set and a pocketbook.[2] There were no suspects in this case either, as Aretha rarely left her home, except when visiting her best friend or for treatment at Grady Memorial Hospital.[4]\n",

More serious offenses followed in Mobley's adolescence and by his mid twenties, he had served prison sentences for forgery and began a series of armed robberies.[5]\nA number of social workers and psychologists had evaluated Mobley during his youth for possible learning disability or organic brain disorder, and despite finding him \"manipulative, self-centered and impulsive,\" found no evidence of either.[4]\n",

It was closed in 2011.[5]\nMetro State opened in 1980 as a men's prison. In 1993 the male prisoners were moved out of Metro and were replaced with prisoners from the Georgia Women's Correctional Institution.[5] The prison planned to move the 700 male prisoners at Metro to other prisons. The swap was scheduled for completion on July 1, 1993.[6] As the transfer occurred the prison was the only co-ed prison in the State of Georgia.[1] Georgia DOC officials said that the gender swap occurred because many female prisoners were from Greater Atlanta and the proximity would provide more opportunities for family members to visit them. In addition, the location allowed female prisoners to have more access to psychological and medical services available in Greater Atlanta. Lynn Cook of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said \"[t]he swap also made [sic] to get the female inmates out of a culture at Georgia Women\u2019s Correctional Institution that had allowed officers and other workers at the prison to engage in sexual relationships with inmates.\"[5]\nIn 2011 the State of Georgia closed the prison. The women were moved to Lee Arrendale State Prison and Pulaski State Prison. Georgia DOC officials declined to state when the agency began moving the prisoners or when the move had been completed, citing security concerns. The inmates and employees had been cleared out of the prison by Friday April 1, 2011. Brian Owens, the Commissioner, stated in 2011 to members of the Georgia Legislature that the number of women coming into the Georgia DOC system had declined even though the overall prison population had increased. In January 2011 Owens said that a private prison company may have expressed an interest in buying the prison. In April 2011 a spokesperson for the Georgia DOC said that the state had no plans for the facility.[5] At the time of the closure the prison had 319 employees. The state offered them transfers to other prisons.[7]\n",

Hicks they seized Jones. His body was riddled with bullets after being lynched,[4] \"saturated with coal oil\" and lit on fire.[5] He was still alive as the flames consumed his body and the mob watched as he writhed in pain.[1]  There were no arrests.\nThese race riots were one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer of 1919, which included terrorist attacks on black communities and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington DC. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively. Both had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching into the millions of dollars.[6]\n",

Sentenced to death in Florida and to life imprisonment in Georgia and North Carolina, Hilton remains a suspect in several other killings, including that of Judy Smith.\nOn October 21, 2007, a retired couple of avid hikers living in Horse Shoe, North Carolina,[2] John and Irene Bryant (80 and 84, respectively), left for a hike through the Pisgah National Forest, leaving their parked maroon Ford Escape at the Yellow Gap Road near U.S. Route 276. After not hearing from them for two weeks, family members reported the couple as missing to the Henderson County Sheriff's Office, who promptly launched a search for the Bryants, consisting of more than 30 volunteers, cadaver dogs and a helicopter. Through examining their phone records, it was learned that Irene had attempted to call 911 on the day of her disappearance, but the signal was lost, and the call was dropped.[3]\nOn November 10, 2007 the search party located the body of a woman on the Barnett Branch trail, covered with leaves. Suspecting that it might belong to Irene, they sent it to the state medical examiner's office in Chapel Hill to perform an autopsy.[4] Three days later, the body was positively identified as that of Irene, who had been bludgeoned to death with a blunt instrument.[5] As this was now considered a homicide perpetrated on federal land, the FBI launched an investigation with an award of $10,000 to whoever could provide information leading to the killer. Simultaneously, it was revealed that a bank card belonging to the Bryants had been used to withdraw $300 from an ATM in Ducktown, Tennessee, with the surveillance cameras showing an older Caucasian man wearing a yellow rainjacket whose hood was obscuring his face.[6] By this time, John was still considered a missing person, possibly abducted by whoever had killed his wife.[7]\n",

Hill, fatally shot by police officer Robert Olsen, suffered from mental illness and was naked and unarmed at the time of the incident.[1][2] The incident was covered in local and national press and sparked the involvement of Black Lives Matter and other advocacy groups who demonstrated their anger at the shooting. In January 2016, a grand jury indicted officer Olsen on two counts of felony murder and one count of aggravated assault.[3][4][5]  Nearing the fourth anniversary of the homicide, it was decided that Olsen's trial would be rescheduled for September 23, 2019, with delays including three successive judges having recused themselves in the case.[6][7]\nAnthony Hill (born June 15, 1988), born in Moncks Corner, South Carolina, was a veteran of the United States Air Force who had served in Afghanistan.[8] According to his family, he had post-traumatic stress disorder.[5] He had been medically discharged from the Air Force two years before[9] after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder.[10] On a Twitter account apparently belonging to Hill, he acknowledged having the disorder.[11]  According to his girlfriend, he had recently stopped taking his medication due to muscular side effects, believing he would see his doctor at the VA within the week.[12][9][13]\nHill was noted to be acting erratically when police were called; he had hung from his second-story balcony in his apartment complex, and his speech was slurred.[5] He had reportedly been running around the complex naked and knocking on doors[14] asking for his medicine and lying and crawling on the ground.[11] The woman who called 911 told Hill's family's lawyer that she had called in order to get medical personnel to come for Hill.[10]\n",

Georgia invalidated all previously enacted death penalty laws in the United States. He later participated in the first successful escape from a Georgia death row, but was killed later that night, aged 32. His own murder remains officially unsolved.\nGregg was convicted of murdering Fred Edward Simmons and Bob Durwood Moore in order to rob them. The victims had given him and another man, Dennis Weaver, a ride when they were hitchhiking; Gregg admitted to shooting them, robbing them and stealing their car.[1] The crime occurred on November 21, 1973. In Gregg v. Georgia, the Supreme Court held by a 7\u20132 majority that the State of Georgia could constitutionally put Gregg to death; Georgia, in common with Texas and Florida, had instituted a death penalty statute requiring a separate bifurcated trial proceeding to determine punishment in a capital case after the establishment of guilt,[2] establishing a list of aggravating circumstances that must be present to consider a death penalty, and providing for review by the State Supreme Court.[3] It also allowed for consideration of mitigating circumstances; on the same day, the Court, whose primary concern was racial bias in sentencing, rejected the North Carolina and Louisiana death penalty statutes for failure to allow for mitigating circumstances to be considered in sentencing.[1]\nOn July 28, 1980, Gregg escaped together with three other condemned murderers, Timothy McCorquodale, Johnny L. Johnson, and David Jarrell,[5] from Georgia State Prison in Reidsville in the first death row breakout in Georgia history. The four had altered their prison clothing to resemble the uniforms worn by correctional officers, then sawed through the bars of their cells and a window and walked along a ledge to a fire escape.[6] They subsequently drove off in a car which had been left in the visitors' parking lot by one of the escapees' aunts. Their escape was not discovered until Gregg telephoned a newspaper to explain their reasons for doing so.[6]\n",

Hayes was killed on May 18, and the next day (May 19), his pregnant wife Mary was strung up by her feet, doused with gasoline and oil then set on fire. Mary's unborn child was cut from her abdomen and stomped to death. Her body was then repeatedly shot. No one was ever convicted of her lynching[citation needed].\nThese lynchings are examples of the racially-motivated mob violence by white people against black people in the American South, especially during 1880 to 1930, the peak of lynchings. Brooks County in Georgia, and Georgia among the states, had the highest rates of lynching in the nation during this period[citation needed].\nThe NAACP referred to Mary Turner's murder in its anti-lynching campaigns of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s.[2] In the lynching era from 1880 to 1930, the great majority of these murders were committed in the South.[3] Most of the thousands of individuals lynched in the United States were black,[4] and most were men, but at least 159 women were known to have been lynched[citation needed].\n",

During this time, the white supremacist terrorist group KKK was in its prime. KKK members were responsible for multiple lynchings of black people who decided to vote following Snipes' murder. For example, two black couples were lynched five days later.[3] Prior to the election, the KKK had made threats to lynch any black person who dared cast a vote. Snipes and his mother were both sharecroppers on Homer Chapman's land in Butler, Georgia. The day after Snipes cast his vote, four white men pulled up to the land Chapman rented to Snipes' family. All four were suspected KKK members: two were later identified as Edward Williamson and Lynwood Harvey, both WWII veterans.[4]\nHaving pulled up outside Snipes' grandfather's house, the four white men asked Snipes' mother to call him outside. They then confronted him, and it ended with Williamson shooting Snipes in the back. After the men left, Snipes and his mother walked to Chapman's house. Chapman helped them walk 3 miles to the hospital in Butler. The hospital staff did not treat Snipes until six hours later. By then, he needed a blood transfusion. The staff claimed that they did not have any \"black blood\". Two days later, Snipes died in the hospital from his injuries. Williamson was an initial suspect in the investigation. In front of a coroner's jury, he claimed that Maceo owed him a $10 debt. Supposedly, Williamson and Harvey went to Snipes to confront him on his debt. Williamson said that Snipes had pulled out a knife, so he shot Snipes twice in the back, claiming self-defense. Coroner J.D. Cooke and a jury declared Williamson's actions as justified.[5] Williamson was exonerated on his charges on July 29, 1946.[6]\n\"We [Negros] want and are entitled to the basic rights and opportunities of American citizens: the right to work . . .; equal opportunities in education, health, recreation and similar public services; the right to vote; equality before the law; [and] . . . the same courtesy and good manners . . .\"\n",

Tradition says that the murders were committed on Moore's Ford Bridge in Walton and Oconee counties between Monroe and Watkinsville, but the four victims, two married couples, were shot and killed on a nearby dirt road.\nThe case attracted national attention and catalyzed large protests in Washington, DC and New York City. President Harry Truman created the President's Committee on Civil Rights and his administration introduced anti-lynching legislation in Congress, but could not get it past the Southern Democratic bloc. The FBI investigated for four months in 1946, the first time it had been ordered to investigate a civil rights case, but it was unable to discover sufficient evidence to bring any charges.\nIn the 1990s publicity about the cold case led to a new investigation. The state of Georgia and the FBI finally closed their cases in December 2017, again unable to prosecute any suspect.[1]\n",

Both victims had been shot in the head, with Jones sustaining a gunshot wound just below his left eye and Seaborne sustaining a gunshot wound to her neck. Three weeks before the murders, Jones had asked Osborne, his sister's boyfriend, to help him sell a motorcycle. Osborne had sold the motorcycle for USD 400 and kept the money. Osborne was interviewed by authorities and eventually admitted to the crime. He claimed, however, that Jones had reached towards the floor for a weapon, and he had acted in self-defense. However, evidence from the crime scene showed Jones had been sitting upright when Osborne shot him and that the gun was only an inch away from his skull.[11] Osborne's mother later testified that her husband's .357 Ruger was missing, a gun which was already suspected as the murder weapon. The gun was never recovered.[12][13]\nIn October 1990, Osborne was indicted on two counts of malice murder and two counts of felony murder.[13] Prosecutors alleged Osborne murdered Jones after he was confronted about the money from the motorcycle sale. Jones had demanded Osborne give him the USD 400, and Osborne had killed him in retaliation, as well as Seaborne because she was a witness.[8] On August 14, 1991, a jury found Osborne guilty, and he was sentenced to death the following day.[12]\n",

According to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary it was the 38th of 61 lynchings during 1922 in the United States. [1]\nMiscegenation is the interbreeding of people who are considered to be members of different races and was heavily frowned upon in the American south. The historical taboo surrounding white\u2013black relationships among American whites can be seen as a historical consequence of the oppression and racial segregation of African Americans.[2][3] In many U.S. states, interracial marriage was already illegal when the term miscegenation was coined in 1863. Before that, it was called \"amalgamation\". \nInterracial relationships were heavily frowned upon and legal bans on Interracial marriages weren't struck down until the Loving v. Virginia case. This was a landmark civil rights decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in which the Court ruled, on June 12, 1967,  that laws banning interracial marriage violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.[4] This case was necessary as bans on interracial relationships were not repealed like other Jim Crow laws by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n",

J.C. Hunter was sentenced to death for the murders in 1910. His sentence was commuted to life in prison one day before his execution date in 1911. He was eventually pardoned by the governor in 1923.\nOn December 10, 1909, two women, Eliza Gribble and her daughter Carrie Ohlander, were discovered beaten[clarification needed] to death inside the house. A third woman, Maggie Hunter, was found barely alive and later died from her injuries in the hospital.  When police arrived on the scene, they found Carrie Ohlander's body in the hallway, and concluded that she had been criminally assaulted before her throat was slit.  Carrie's mother, Eliza Gribble, was found in the back bedroom with her skull beaten in.[1]\nEliza Gribble, 70, was the owner of the house.  She was originally from Cornwell, England, but had settled in Savannah before the Civil War with her late husband R. Gribble.  She had rented the house with her daughter a short time before the murders occurred. Eliza was found sitting in her easy chair in the back bedroom.  A newspaper and her reading glasses lay at her feet.  She had received one to two blows to the back of the head and her grey head showed the imprint of an axe.[2]\nCarrie Ohlander, 36, was Eliza Gribble's daughter.  She was separated from her husband, Andrew J. Ohlander, who was living in Memphis, and had come to Savannah to live with her mother.[3]:\u200a153\u200a Ohlander was partially deaf and believed to be the first to have been attacked, likely trying to protect her mother.  Physicians determined she was criminally assaulted before having her throat cut and being beaten to death.[1]\nMaggie Hunter, 34, had just rented a room and moved into the Gribble House the day before the attacks occurred.  She was estranged from her husband, J.C. Hunter, who was 30 years her senior, at the time, and was planning on making a living on her own by being a seamstress. J.C.  Hunter had just brought a sewing machine over to the house the day before the murders.[1]\n",

Paul Reed and Will Cato, who were African-American, were tried and convicted for the murders.

The next day, the bodies of Hodges, his wife Claudia, their nine-year-old daughter Kitty Corrine, two-year-old son Harmon, and six-month-old son Talmadge were found in the burned house. The remains of the five victims were buried in a single coffin the next day.[1][2]\nEven while the house was still burning, neighbors who arrived during the night discovered Henry Hodges' hat, signs of a struggle, and puddles of blood a short distance from the house. In the morning, footprints of four men, one of whom was barefoot, were found around the house. Dogs were brought, but were unable to track the men very far. Two shoes were found nearby, a brogan and a dress shoe, which a neighbor identified as belonging to pairs of shoes he had bought for an African-American tenant on his farm, Paul Reed. A knife, also identified as belonging to Reed, was found nearby. Several strands of hair, believed to be from Claudia Hodges, were stuck in tar on the heel of one shoe.[3]\n",

During his time on death row, he became a published writer of essays and articles, as well as completing two book-length manuscripts of historical fiction and autobiography.\nJones was first sentenced to death on October 17, 1979, for his involvement in the felony murder of Roger Tackett on June 17 of that year during a robbery of a Tenneco convenience store, of which Tackett was the manager.[1][2][3] Jones was convicted in relation to this murder along with Van Roosevelt Solomon (December 1, 1943 \u2013 February 20, 1985), who was executed in 1985 by electrocution at age 41.[1] In 1989, a federal court ordered Jones to be re-sentenced because the jurors who had convicted him had improperly brought a Bible into the deliberation room.[4] He was re-sentenced to death in 1997.[2] In January 2016, Jones' attorneys asked the Butts County Superior Court to stop his execution by challenging the state's injection drug secrecy law, and arguing that the death penalty was too harsh a punishment for his crime. Both arguments were rejected by the court.[1] On February 2, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit voted 6-5 not to hear Jones' challenge of Georgia's drug secrecy law.[5] Jones was executed early on February 3, 2016 by lethal IV  injection, ten days before his 73rd birthday. The executioner team struggled for an hour to insert the IV into Jones' veins,[6] spending 24 minutes trying to get it into a vein in his left arm, another eight minutes trying his right arm and then they asked a doctor in attendance to insert it into Jones' groin which took 13 minutes.[7] Jones was pronounced dead at 12:46 a.m.[1]\n",

His two killers: Robert Earl Butts Jr. (May 14, 1977 \u2013 May 4, 2018) and Marion Wilson Jr. (July 29, 1976 \u2013 June 20, 2019) were executed for the crime by the state of Georgia via lethal injection, in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Wilson was the 1,500th person to be executed in the United States since capital punishment was resumed in 1976.[1][2][3]\nParks was born in 1971 in Milledgeville, Georgia. At the time of his murder, he was working two jobs, one as a prison guard and the other at a Winn-Dixie grocery store. He was trying to make money to study to become a prison counselor. According to his brother, Parks wanted to help inmates facing long prison sentences, as well as inmates who were getting ready to transition back into society. In 1995, Parks' mother died, and less than six months later, the family home caught fire. Following the fire, Parks' brother moved out of Milledgeville and joined the Army.[4]\nWilson was born in 1976 and was physically abused by his grandfather and his mother's boyfriends as a child.[5] On January 31, 1989, Wilson and two other boys started a fire at an apartment in Glynn County while the residents were home.[5] On December 16, 1991, Wilson shot Jose Luis Valle, a Mexican migrant worker. According to three youths who were with Wilson, he said he was going to rob Valle and \"wanted to see what it felt like to shoot somebody.\" When Valle left the store, Wilson approached him and drew a pistol. When Valle raised his hands in surrender and tried to run, Wilson shot him in the buttocks. He later threatened a witness who gave a statement to the police. The charges against Wilson did not go to trial when the authorities failed to locate Valle after he was discharged from the hospital. While in a juvenile detention center, he assaulted a youth worker.[5]\n",

His body was discovered on March 15, 2007, just a few miles from where he disappeared.\nGeorge, David, and Peggy Edenfield were all accused of Barrios' abduction and murder. A fourth person, Donald Dale, originally charged with tampering with evidence and concealing a body, has since pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of lying to police. Superior Court Judge Stephen Scarlett accepted the plea and transferred Dale to a mental-health facility, and banished him from Glynn County.[1] Peggy Edenfield testified in the case against her husband David and agreed to testify against her son George during his trial. In exchange for her testimony, Peggy avoided the death penalty; she was eventually sentenced to sixty years in prison.[2]\nThe trial of David Homer Edenfield (born June 4, 1948)[3] began on September 29, 2009, and ended on October 5, 2009.[4] The prosecution relied heavily on Edenfield's videotaped confession and his wife's testimony.[5] Dr. Jamie Downs, the medical examiner who performed Christopher's autopsy, also testified to the extent of trauma found on the body and also the manner of death, which Edenfield's taped confession corroborated.[6] Closing arguments began on the fifth day and the jury was sent to deliberate that afternoon. On October 5, with only two hours of deliberation, the jury returned with a verdict of \"guilty on all counts.\"[7] On October 6, David Edenfield was sentenced to death.[8]\n",

The decapitated body of Russell Dermond (age 88) was found on May 6, 2014, in the garage of the house he owned on Lake Oconee. Neither his head nor his wife, Shirley (age 87), could be located in the house. Over a week later, Shirley's body was discovered floating in Lake Oconee, her body having been weighted down with concrete blocks. As of 2022, the murders remain unsolved and Russell's head has not been found.[1]\nRussell Joseph Dermond, a native of Hackensack, New Jersey, served in the United States Navy during World War II.[2]  He married Shirley Wilcox on December 15, 1950. They went on to have four children and nine grandchildren. After working in the fast food industry, including owning several Hardee's locations in Atlanta, Russell retired in 1994. The Dermonds went on to move into Great Waters Reynolds at Lake Oconee, a gated community located about twelve miles northeast of Eatonton.[1][3] In 2000, their oldest son Mark was murdered in Atlanta while attempting to purchase crack cocaine. Investigators believe that there is no connection between this crime and the murder of Mark's parents.[2]\nRussell was last seen alive on May 1, 2014, as he was running errands in Eatonton. Along with Shirley, he spoke with his son Brad over the phone later that day. The Dermonds were expected to attend a party for the 2014 Kentucky Derby the following weekend with their neighbors, who grew concerned when the couple did not show up. On May 6, one neighbor went to the Dermonds' house to check on them.[3] The neighbor found the door unlocked and entered the house. Russell's decapitated body was found on the floor of his two-car garage, lying in a small pool of blood.[1] When police were unable to locate Shirley inside the house, they initially suspected that she had been kidnapped.[4] Ten days later, Shirley's body was found by fishermen on Lake Oconee. An autopsy found that she had died from either two or three deep wounds to the head from a blunt object.[5]\n",

He was subsequently sentenced to death for killing his cellmate, Joseph Handspike.[1] In 1990, Hill killed Handspike in their cell by bludgeoning him to death with a wooden board studded with nails.[2][3]\nHis execution by lethal injection, scheduled for July 15, 2013,  was postponed due to a legal challenge against Georgia's Lethal Injection Secrecy Act. This law, passed in March 2013, makes the identities of companies and individuals who make and supply lethal injection drugs, and the identities of the doctors hired by the state to oversee executions, a \"state secret\" that must be shielded from disclosure to the public, the media, and even the judiciary. Hill's lawyers argued that this would prevent Hill from knowing whether the execution would be carried out by competent personnel using properly formulated drugs.[4] The secrecy regime was ultimately upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court.[5]\nThere was also controversy as to whether or not Hill qualified as being mentally disabled, a designation that would have precluded him from being executed.[6] On this basis of his mental capabilities the European Union had appealed several times to the Georgia Chairman of the Board of Pardons and Paroles and Georgia Governor Nathan Deal to prevent Hill from being executed.[7] Hill was executed on January 27, 2015.[8][9]\n",

While at GDCP, inmates are either in the process of being classified and tested, or they are assigned as a \"permanent.\" Those inmates who are 'permanents' will serve their entire sentence at the GDCP, while the remainder of inmates will be tested and then moved to other prisons based on their classifications.\nBased on published research statistics by the Georgia Department of Corrections,[8] inmates who are being diagnosed and classified undergo a battery of tests and diagnostic questionnaires. Tests and diagnostic notations include: the culture fair IQ test; Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) (reading, math, and spelling); scope of substance abuse (summary & detailed report); latest mental health treatment; PULHESDWIT medical scale; criminality, alcoholism, and/or drug abuse in immediate family; one or both parents absent during childhood; manipulative or assaultive tendency diagnostics; and criminal history report with prior incarcerations and a full account of all previous and current offenses.\n",

Louisiana, 428 U.S. 153 (1976), is a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. It reaffirmed the Court's acceptance of the use of the death penalty in the United States, upholding, in particular, the death sentence imposed on Troy Leon Gregg. The case is referred to by a leading scholar as the July 2 Cases,[1] and elsewhere referred to by the lead case Gregg. The court set forth the two main features that capital sentencing procedures must employ in order to comply with the Eighth Amendment ban on \"cruel and unusual punishments\". The decision essentially ended the de facto moratorium on the death penalty imposed by the Court in its 1972 decision in Furman v. Georgia 408 U.S. 238 (1972).\nAll five cases share the same basic procedural history. After the Furman decision, the states of Georgia, Florida, Texas, North Carolina, and Louisiana amended their death penalty statutes to meet the Furman guidelines. Subsequently, the five named defendants[a] were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in their respective states. The respective state supreme courts[b] upheld the death sentence. The defendants then asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review their death sentence, asking the Court to go beyond Furman and declare once and for all the death penalty to be \"cruel and unusual punishment\" and thus in violation of the Constitution; the Court agreed to hear the cases.\nIn the July 2 Cases, the Court's goal was to provide guidance to states in the wake of Furman. In Furman only one basic idea could command a majority vote of the Justices: capital punishment, as then practiced in the United States, was cruel and unusual punishment because there were no rational standards that determined when it was imposed and when it was not. The question the Court resolved in these cases was not whether the death sentence imposed on each of the individual defendants was cruel, but rather whether the process by which those sentences were imposed was rational and objectively reviewable.\n",

At the time of his murder, he was working two jobs, one as a prison guard and the other at a Winn-Dixie grocery store. He was trying to make money to study to become a prison counselor. According to his brother, Parks wanted to help inmates facing long prison sentences, as well as inmates who were getting ready to transition back into society. In 1995, Parks' mother died, and less than six months later, the family home caught fire. Following the fire, Parks' brother moved out of Milledgeville and joined the Army.[4]\nWilson was born in 1976 and was physically abused by his grandfather and his mother's boyfriends as a child.[5] On January 31, 1989, Wilson and two other boys started a fire at an apartment in Glynn County while the residents were home.[5] On December 16, 1991, Wilson shot Jose Luis Valle, a Mexican migrant worker. According to three youths who were with Wilson, he said he was going to rob Valle and \"wanted to see what it felt like to shoot somebody.\" When Valle left the store, Wilson approached him and drew a pistol. When Valle raised his hands in surrender and tried to run, Wilson shot him in the buttocks. He later threatened a witness who gave a statement to the police. The charges against Wilson did not go to trial when the authorities failed to locate Valle after he was discharged from the hospital.

        "paragraph": "The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pittsburgh Panthers. The game was played on January 2, since New Year's Day was a Sunday. Much controversy preceded the 1956 Sugar Bowl. Segregationists and Georgia governor Marvin Griffin used all his political power in an attempt to keep Pitt fullback/linebacker Bobby Grier from playing because he was black. But ultimately, Bobby Grier played making this the first integrated Sugar Bowl and is the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.[1]\nThis game occurred during segregation battles in the south, including Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and the murder of Emmett Till (1955).  The Sugar Bowl had been racially segregated since its first inception in 1935.  No black players had ever taken the field in it.[2]  There were even different sections of the stadium set aside for black and white attendees.[3]  In the past, most Southern colleges (including Georgia Tech) were all-white and had an unofficial \"gentleman's agreement\" with integrated Northern schools in which the teams would only play against each other if the African American players on the team were benched for the game.[4]  By the 1950s, this agreement was starting to break down, with some Northern schools refusing to honor it and some Southern schools agreeing to play against integrated teams so long as the game took place in the North.  Many Southern schools responded to this shift by simply refusing to play Northern schools at all, resulting in a significant decline in inter-sectional gameplay.  The Bowl games, most of which took place in the South, became a focal point of contention.  The Cotton Bowl in Dallas held its first integrated game in 1948, and the Sun Bowl in El Paso held one in 1950.[5]  But up to 1956, most Southern games still remained strictly segregated.\nGeorgia Tech had been involved in a previous racial incident in 1934, when the team refused to play a game against the University of Michigan unless the Wolverines benched their star end, a black player named Willis Ward.  Michigan eventually complied with the demand, but only after Georgia Tech agreed to reciprocate by benching their own star end, Hoot Gibson.  With both players out of the game, it proceeded on schedule, with Michigan winning 9-2 to earn what turned out to be their only victory of the season.[6]  By 1956, Georgia Tech had a progressive President and they had played against integrated teams before, including a game against Notre Dame two years earlier (a 27-14 defeat that ended the Yellow Jackets' 31-game winning streak),[6] but none of these games had taken place in the South.[2]\n",

The Klan spread across Georgia and by the fall 260 cases were filed of violence inflicted on blacks, but the court cases were denied by black people against whites. There were also instances where the Klan attacked Georgian Republicans, regardless of the color of their skin. In October 1868, there was a report of 32 assassinations and 212 assaults to the Committee on Murder and Outrages at a convention held in Macon, Georgia.[2]\nCritics of Adkins considered him a scalawag, someone disloyal to the Confederacy. He supported civil rights for blacks. He also supported posted a statutory bond for someone hated by the Klan and conservatives, Sheriff John Norris in April 1868. He also reported racist crimes and the name of a suspect, Ellis Adams, who was a member of the Klan.[citation needed] Violence continued into 1869,[2] and he led a delegation to Washington, D.C. to request military support in Georgia for safety of its citizens.[citation needed]\n",

He was also, briefly, the provisional president of Georgia in 1777, and Gwinnett County (now a major suburb of metropolitan Atlanta) was named for him. He was named in honor of his mother\u2019s cousin, Barbara Button, who became his godmother.[1][2]  Gwinnett was killed in a duel by rival Lachlan McIntosh following a dispute after a failed invasion of East Florida.\nGwinnett was born in 1735 in the parish of Down Hatherley in the county of Gloucestershire, England, to a Welsh father, the Reverend Samuel Gwinnett, (Gwinnett deriving from the Welsh kingdom of Gwynedd) and his wife, Anne. He was the third of his parents' seven children, born after his older sister Anna Maria and his older brother Samuel. There are conflicting reports as to his exact birthdate, but he was baptized in St Catherine's Church in Gloucester on April 10, 1735. It is believed that he attended the College School, held in Gloucester Cathedral (now called The King's School) as did his older brother, but there is no surviving evidence to substantiate this.  He started his career apprenticed to his uncle William Gwinnett, a greengrocer in Gloucester, then moved to Wolverhampton in Staffordshire in 1754 after obtaining a further apprenticeship with an ironmonger there named John Weston Smith. On 19 April 1757 he married Ann Bourne, daughter of a greengrocer, at St. Peter's Church, Wolverhampton. In 1762, the couple, who parented three daughters, departed Wolverhampton and emigrated to America.[3]\nGwinnett's business activities took him from Newfoundland to Jamaica. Never very successful, he moved to Savannah, Georgia in 1765, and opened a store. When that venture failed, he bought (on credit) St. Catherine's Island,[4] as well as a large number of enslaved people,[5] in order to attempt to become a planter. Though his planting activities were also unsuccessful, he did make a name for himself in local politics and was elected to the Provincial Assembly.[6]\n",

While residing there, his neighbors and acquaintances described him as a strange loner who did not mix and carried a gun at all times, even in his own home.

Though he has maintained that the death was a tragic accident, Cooper's father Justin Ross Harris was arrested and charged with his son's murder.[1] On November 14, 2016, after a jury trial that garnered national media attention, Harris was found guilty of malice murder and felony murder among other charges, in a verdict that has faced some criticism.[2][3][4] He was subsequently sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole plus 32 years.[5][6] On June 22, 2022, Justin Ross Harris's convictions relating to Cooper's death were overturned by the Georgia Supreme Court, concluding that he had not received a fair trial, and will be given a retrial.[7][8][9]\nJustin Harris, who goes by his middle name Ross, was born in 1980. He briefly worked as a police dispatcher in Tuscaloosa until 2009, according to police spokesman Sgt. Brent Blankley.[10] Harris graduated from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa in 2012,[11] receiving a bachelor's degree in commerce and business administration. From there, Harris moved to Georgia to work for The Home Depot as a web developer.\n",

Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972), was a landmark criminal case in which the United States Supreme Court invalidated all then existing legal constructions for the death penalty in the United States. It was 5\u20134 decision, with each member of the majority writing a separate opinion.[1]:\u200a467\u20138\u200a Following Furman, in order to reinstate the death penalty, states had to at least remove arbitrary and discriminatory effects in order to satisfy the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.[1]:\u200a468\u200a\nThe decision mandated a degree of consistency in the application of the death penalty. This case resulted in a de facto moratorium of capital punishment throughout the United States, which ended when the case Gregg v. Georgia was decided in 1976 to allow the death penalty.[2][3]\nThe Supreme Court consolidated the cases Jackson v. Georgia and Branch v. Texas with the Furman decision, thereby invalidating the death penalty for rape; this ruling was confirmed post-Gregg in Coker v. Georgia. The Court had also intended to include the case of Aikens v. California, but between the time Aikens had been heard in oral argument and a decision was to be issued, the Supreme Court of California decided in California v. Anderson that the death penalty violated the state constitution; Aikens was therefore dismissed as moot, since this decision reduced all death sentences in California to life imprisonment.[4]\n",

A wealthy landowner in Meriwether County was pursued by the sheriff of neighboring Coweta County, Georgia. The events were the subject of two acclaimed works, both titled Murder in Coweta County: a 1976 book by Margaret Anne Barnes and a 1983 television movie on CBS starring Johnny Cash and Andy Griffith.\nJohn Wallace, a wealthy landowner, had virtually unlimited power in Meriwether County, Georgia.  Even the sheriff, Hardy Collier, was under his control. Wilson Turner, a sharecropper tenant, attempted to do extra bootlegging work without Wallace's permission and was fired as a result. Turner retaliated by stealing two of Wallace's cows.\nTurner was found and arrested in Carrollton, Georgia, by Chief of Police Threadgill but was transferred from the Carrollton Jail to the Meriwether County Jail in Greenville.[1]  Turner was later released from jail, purportedly because of a lack of evidence. As he left the jail, he discovered John Wallace waiting outside with his men. Realizing that he had been set up, Turner attempted to escape in his truck, with Wallace and his group in pursuit, two men each in two cars.[1]\n",

His trial, conviction, and appeals attracted national attention. His lynching two years later, in response to the commutation of his death sentence, became the focus of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding antisemitism. Today, the consensus of researchers is that Frank was wrongly convicted and Jim Conley was likely the actual murderer.\nBorn to a Jewish-American family in Texas, Frank was raised in New York and earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University before moving to Atlanta in 1908. Marrying in 1910, he involved himself with the city's Jewish community and was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization, in 1912. At that time, there were growing concerns regarding child labor at factories. One of these children was Mary Phagan, who worked at the National Pencil Company where Frank was director. The girl was strangled on April 26, 1913, and found dead in the factory's cellar the next morning. Two notes, made to look as if she had written them, were found beside her body. Based on the mention of a \"night witch\", they implicated the night watchman, Newt Lee. Over the course of their investigations, the police arrested several men, including Lee, Frank, and Jim Conley, a janitor at the factory.\n",

While the Tampa Tribune reported that local Sheriff Etheridge and his deputies hunted for the murderers of Turner.[3] The mob killed father and son Alonzo and James D. Green. To prevent word of the lynching from reaching the outside world the lines of communication were cut.

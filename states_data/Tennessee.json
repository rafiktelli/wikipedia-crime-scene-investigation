As a Mayanist scholar who investigated the pre-Columbian Maya civilization of ancient Mesoamerica, Colas was well known for his contributions to the study of the Maya writing system, and his archaeological work on cave sites used by the Maya. His analysis of onomastics\u2014personal naming practices and titles of rank\u2014in Classic-era Maya inscriptions was the first major publication of its kind. Colas also conducted ethnographic studies and surveys among contemporary Maya communities living in Belize. In Europe, he had close involvement with the organisation of academic conferences and workshops on the Maya, as a workshop tutor, presenter of original papers, and editor of several conference proceedings and reports.[1]\nSince 2006 Colas held a position as assistant professor in the Anthropology Department of the College of Arts and Science at Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.[2]\nOn the evening of August 26, 2008 Dr. Colas was shot dead in his Nashville home.

Although considered a suspect in a total of seven killings, he was only convicted of his confirmed crimes and sentenced to 40 years imprisonment.\nLittle is known about Barnes' early life. Born on April 27, 1944, in Detroit, Michigan, he was regularly mistreated by his alcoholic parents, with Barnes claiming that his mother had attempted to miscarry by ingesting a quantity of drugs. In another instance, he had been put in a sack and lowered into a well as punishment for misbehaving.[1] He started exhibiting signs of mental illness early in his life, and had to be treated in various institutions around Michigan, Tennessee and Missouri for depression, hallucinations and drug abuse. In between these treatments, Barnes committed a variety of petty crimes, with his most notable conviction being for a bank robbery committed in Detroit.\nAfter being released from prison, Barnes found employment as a factory worker for a General Motors plant, but was laid off after company sales went down. Left without a home or any close living relatives, he decided to move to Memphis, Tennessee, settling in the Knightwoods neighborhood of Parkway Village.[1]\n",

According to his criminal conviction, on Saturday, June 27, 1987, he attempted to rape an acquaintance of his, Charisse Christopher, and murdered her and her two-year-old daughter, Lacie Jo. Neighbors alleged they heard noises and yelling, and called the police. Upon arriving, a police officer \"immediately encountered Payne who was leaving the apartment building, so covered in blood that he appeared to be 'sweating blood'\".\nThe defendant, in contrast, said that he was in the building on a visit to his girlfriend and hearing screams from the room of the murder victims he went in to help. Payne and many other witnesses saw a man leaving the crime scene shortly before Payne arrived. He had found the knife still stuck in the throat of Charisse and pulled it out. He fled when he saw police arrive.\n",

Despite the 100-mile distance, and unlike most legislators from parts of the state a considerable distance from Nashville, Burks made it a practice to go home to his district and his farm almost every night, even during legislative sessions.\n",

His murder remains unsolved.[1]\nOn July 5, 1996, Blair Adams, a resident of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, withdrew most of his money from his bank account and emptied his safe deposit box of cash, jewelry, gold, and platinum.[2][3] He then attempted to enter the United States via ferry from Victoria, British Columbia, to Seattle, Washington.[2] Immigration officials flagged Adams as a possible drug courier due to the large amount of cash he had with him. Once he was found to have convictions on drug and assault charges he was denied entry.[4]\nIn the early morning hours of July 9, Adams was discovered by Canadian border patrol officers attempting to cross the border on foot at the Pacific Highway Border Crossing.[1] Officials noted Adams had scratches covering his legs and hands.[1] Adams matched the description of a man implicated in an automobile theft, and the vehicle had been discovered abandoned near the Pacific Highway Border Crossing; however, he denied involvement and was freed on lack of evidence.[1]\n",

Barrett had been arrested just days after Trimble's disappearance on suspicion of an unrelated sexual assault, and was still in jail when Trimble's body was found. Despite this and his convictions for attacks on other women and children, police had not investigated him in relation to the murder. On July 18, 2009, a jury convicted him for the killing, and he was sentenced to forty-four years in prison.\nTrimble's murder occurred soon after two other crimes linked to Barrett:\n",

At the time of her murder she was stationed at Naval Support Activity Mid-South in Millington, Tennessee. Collins was a student undergoing training at the base, and was scheduled to graduate from avionics training on the day of her murder. She is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Suzanne Collins was the daughter of Jack and Trudy Collins. She graduated from John R. Lewis High School in Springfield, Virginia.\nOn the evening of July 11, 1985, Suzanne Marie Collins was abducted while jogging on the base, and was taken to nearby Edmund Orgill Park. There, the kidnapper severely beat Collins, fracturing her skull, before repeatedly shoving a tree limb up her vagina with enough force to penetrate her abdomen and tear one of her lungs. The autopsy would state that Collins died from blunt force trauma to the head and internal hemorrhaging from the tree limb.[1] The kidnapper then ditched the body and fled the scene.\nTwo Marines jogging near where Collins was abducted heard her scream and ran toward the sound. However, as they reached the scene, they saw a car leaving the area. They reported to base security and accompanied officers on a tour of the base, looking for the car. Unsuccessful, they returned to their barracks, but soon the Marines were called back to the security office. There they identified Sedley Alley's car, which had been stopped by officers. Alley and his wife gave statements to the base security personnel accounting for their whereabouts. The security personnel were satisfied with Alley's story, and Alley and his wife returned to their on-base housing. The two Marine witnesses returned to the security office shortly after Alley and his wife departed. The Marines disputed the couple's version of events, citing that the loud, distinct sounds made by the muffler on Alley's car matched those sounds they had heard prior to and during Collins' abduction. The security personnel indicated that since no one had yet been reported missing, there was nothing more that could be done. The Marines were thanked for their assistance and told to return to their barracks.[1]\n",

Johnson Rehabilitation Center in Nashville for her involvement in the Lillelid murders.  \nIn her book The Scarred Heart: Understanding and Identifying Kids Who Kill, forensic psychologist Helen Smith considers Natasha Cornett's troubled life as a warning of the failures of the school, mental health, and criminal justice systems in preventive treatment.[1]\nCornett was born into poverty in rural Pike County, located in Eastern Kentucky.  Cornett's mother, Madonna Wallen, was not married to her biological father, a local policeman named Roger Burgess with whom Madonna was having an affair. When Natasha was a toddler, Madonna left her husband, Ed Wallen, and raised Natasha alone as a single mother[2] in a ram-shackle trailer[3] located in the outskirts of Pikeville, Kentucky.  It is believed Natasha received little or no parental support (financial or social) from either her biological father or Madonna's ex-husband, whose name had been entered on her birth certificate.[2] According to Tennessee court records, she grew up with \"the lack of a father figure, and an irresponsible mother\".[4]  By junior high school, Cornett was alienated from most of her fellow pupils because of her unconventional behavior.  She suffered from anorexia and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which went largely untreated due to lack of health insurance.[2]  By the time she entered high school, Cornett was being openly harassed and bullied by other students for her uncommon dress and conduct. Pleas for help by her were ignored by unsympathetic school authorities.[3] Sometime during her freshman year of high school, Cornett dropped out.[2]\n",

Abdus-Salaam was then shot and killed by a responding police officer on the scene.[1]\nA man armed with a knife inside a Pilot truck rest stop followed store manager Joyce Whaley, 57, into the woman's bathroom, launching the start of a stabbing rampage. He stabbed Whaley 11 times, killing her, and then left the washroom to attack other patrons at the station. He stabbed to death Patricia Denise Nibbe, who was nearby the washroom door - and then began to stab Nettie R. Spencer, 41.\nOthers at the scene began to react to the attack, and attempted to intervene against the assailant, with one person reportedly spraying the attacker with a fire extinguisher as Spencer managed to leave through the front door of the station. The assailant chased Spencer outside and began attacking her again, killing her. He then launched himself at the nearby car of customer Dessa Hutchison, who had left the station earlier in response to the attack, and fled to the driver's seat of her vehicle to call 911. The attacker pulled Hutchison from her car, repeatedly stabbing her while she was still on the line with police operators. The attacker then left her car, and began wandering around the station's parking lot.\n",

He was arrested and was awaiting trial when he was captured by a lynch party, who burned him alive and scattered his remains around town, throwing his head at a group of African Americans. A large crowd attended his lynching, which had the atmosphere of a carnival. No one was charged as a result of the lynching, which was described as one of the most vicious in American history, but it did play a part in the foundation of the Memphis chapter of the NAACP.[1]\nDescribed as \"[i]nnocent, pure, pretty, by turns playful and pensive\" and as someone who \"must have reminded many readers of their own daughters, nieces, or cousins\", Rappel was a student at Treadwell School in Memphis. On the morning of 30 April 1917, she left for school and did not return; on 2 May 1917 a newspaper published a story which said she left to join the war, a story her mother, Mrs Wood, reportedly believed. Later, Rappel was found dead, with evidence she had been raped, in woods near Macon Road and half a mile from the home of Persons,[n 1] a nearly fifty-year-old woodcutter. She had been decapitated with an axe. At the scene, they found a white coat, a white handkerchief, and axe dents in the ground. After the arrests of several black men, the police brought in Persons, and subjected him to brutal treatment for 24 hours, after which the police said he confessed to the murder. Sheriff Mike Tate, Deputy Sheriff M.W. Palmer, City Detectives C. A. Brunner and J. W. Hoyle alternated with rapid fire questions that led to the confession.[2] Eager to prove Persons' guilt, Mike Tate, Shelby County sheriff, ordered that Rappel's body be exhumed so that they could look at her pupils, because the authorities thought that a photograph of the pupils could be used to show the last image seen by a person who had died, a theory developed by Alphonse Bertillon, a French biometrics researcher of that time. Despite being told by eye specialists that it would be impossible, the authorities said they saw Persons in Rappel's pupils\u2014which showed a \"frozen expression of horror\"\u2014and he was taken to Tennessee State Prison in Nashville to await arraignment and trial.[3] Deputy Sheriff Palmer along with Detectives Brunner and Hoyle encountered angry mobs at nearly every city along the way before they safely reached Nashville via train and placed Persons in custody.[4]\n",

Shipp and five others of Chattanooga, Tennessee, having \"in effect aided and abetted\" the lynching of Ed Johnson.[1] They were held in contempt of court and sentenced to imprisonment. It remains the only Supreme Court criminal trial in history.\nEd Johnson, a black man, had been convicted in Hamilton County, Tennessee, of the rape of a white woman on February 11, 1906 and sentenced to death.  On March 3, 1906, Johnson's lawyer Noah W. Parden filed a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that his constitutional rights had been violated.  Specifically, Parden alleged that all blacks had been systematically excluded from both the grand jury considering the original indictment against him and the trial jury considering his case. He further argued that he had been substantively denied the right to counsel, as his lawyer at the time had been too intimidated by the threats of mob violence to file motions for a change of venue, a continuance, or a new trial, all of which could be reasonably expected under the circumstances. Parden asserted Johnson was thus about to be deprived of his life without due process.[2]\nParden's petition was initially denied on March 10, 1906, and Johnson was remanded to the custody of Hamilton County Sheriff Joseph F. Shipp, with the stipulation for Johnson to be given 10 days to file further appeals.[3]  His appeal to the Supreme Court was granted by Justice Harlan on March 17 and subsequently by the entire court on March 19. However, despite being advised of the ruling by telegram on that date and the case and the ruling being given full coverage by Chattanooga's evening newspapers that day, Shipp and his chief jailer nonetheless allowed a mob to enter the Hamilton County Jail and to lynch Johnson on the city's Walnut Street Bridge.\n",

Hits including \"If You Ain't Lovin' (You Ain't Livin')\" and \"Live Fast, Love Hard, Die Young\" marked him as a honky-tonk singer in sound and personal style; and his chart-topping singles \"Hello Walls\" and \"It's Four in the Morning\" showed his versatility as a vocalist. Known as the Hillbilly Heartthrob, and following a singing cowboy film role as the Young Sheriff, Young's singles charted for more than 30 years. In failing health, he died by suicide at 64 in 1996.[1] Young is a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame.\nYoung was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the youngest of six children of Harlan and Doris Young. He grew up on a dairy farm that his family operated outside the city. Young began singing at an early age, imagining a career as a pop singer. However, after he joined some friends watching Hank Williams perform with nine encores on the Louisiana Hayride, Young switched to country music instead. He performed at the local Optimist Club and was discovered by Webb Pierce, who brought him to star on the Hayride in 1951, then broadcast on KWKH-AM. He graduated from Fair Park High School that year and attended Centenary College of Louisiana.\n",

Peter survived, but, as a result of the shooting, was left with disabilities.[1] Six young people from Kentucky, including two minors, were convicted of felony murder for the deaths of Vidar, Delfina, and Tabitha Lillelid, with all six perpetrators receiving three life sentences, and an additional sentence of 25 years each for the attempted murder of Peter Lillelid.[2]\nVidar Lillelid grew up in Bergen, Norway, and in 1985 moved to United States. In 1989, Lillelid married Delfina Zelaya, a first-generation Honduran-American from New York City, whom he had met through their common involvement in the Jehovah's Witnesses denomination.[citation needed].

        "paragraph": "\nThe Barack Obama assassination plot in Tennessee was a plot by Paul Schlesselman and Daniel Cowart to assassinate Barack Obama, who was then the 2008 Democratic Party presidential nominee. The two men, both Neo-Nazi white power skinheads, spoke of killing Obama during a planned murder spree of 88 African Americans in Tennessee (in reference to the Nazi slogan Heil Hitler), 14 of whom were to be beheaded (a reference to the Fourteen Words slogan), many of whom were young students at an unidentified, predominantly black school.\nSchlesselman and Cowart were arrested on October 22, 2008, and found to be in possession of several weapons. The men told authorities of their planned assassination and killing spree, and said they intended to rob a weapon store to obtain additional weapons and commit home robberies to help fund the operation. Although the United States Secret Service said they were taking the plot seriously, authorities were unsure how capable Schlesselman and Cowart were of carrying out the alleged plot. Both plotters pleaded guilty to various federal charges; Judge J. Daniel Breen of the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee sentenced Schlesselman to 10 years imprisonment on April 15, 2010, and Cowart to 14 years in prison on October 22, 2010.\n",

Being accused of theft, Crutchfield was quickly arrested and thrown in jail. A white mob sprang him from jail but he escaped as they tried to lynch him.

The men were missing and being searched for by their relatives when they did not return home. These relatives followed a blood path to the bodies off Big Fork Road and later found the victims' ATVs in a separate location. Their bullet-riddled bodies and ATVs were found in the woods of Signal Mountain near Roberts Mill Road. The three men had been riding along trails, portions of which crossed private property, with the intention of going swimming. \nThe owners of the land were Frank Casteel and his wife, Susie. When Frank noticed more and more people intruding on his land he consulted a police officer who advised him to keep a logbook of everyone he witnessed.  Frank had a run in with the three men and wrote it down, though never mentioned anything of murder. The men were later found dead and Casteel was a prime suspect. At the time Frank had a mistress, Mrs. Marie Hill, to whom Casteel\u2019s wife sent his logbook in hopes that Mrs. Hill would leave him.[1] Mrs. Hill turned in the logbook to the police for evidence. Although there was no mention of violent behavior in the book and no physical evidence to support Casteel\u2019s conviction, he was sentenced to life in prison. An appeal was made and eventually given an opportunity to overturn Casteel\u2019s conviction in 2001.[2] The attorneys said there was no hard evidence that clearly identifies Casteel as the murderer.[3] In 2003 Frank Casteel was found guilty again for the triple homicide and returned to prison.[4] Casteel died in prison in May 2019 at the age of 71.[5]\nIn 2020, Casteel's son Franklin Trever Casteel authored a book on the subject.

Her husband, Perry March, a lawyer, told police he had last seen his wife when she left the house on the night of August 15, two weeks earlier, following an argument. He claimed she had packed her bags for a 12-day vacation at an unknown location and driven away. She was never seen alive by anyone else afterwards.\nJanet's car was found at a nearby apartment complex a week after the police report, apparently having been there for some time. Other evidence began to suggest that Perry had fabricated some evidence of his wife's supposed motive for departure, and attempted to tamper with or destroy other items that might have provided evidence. Police soon reclassified the case as a homicide, despite the absence of Janet's body, and named Perry as a suspect. Shortly afterwards he moved back to his native Chicago area with the couple's two children. After his in-laws won visitation, he fled with the children to Mexico, where his father, Arthur, a former U.S. Army pharmacist, had retired. The case received attention in the national media, where it was the subject of two segments on the CBS News program 48 Hours.[2][3]\n",

The murder became a point of reference in the ongoing debate about the policy known as \"Don't ask, don't tell\", which did not allow U.S. military gays, bisexuals, and lesbians to be open about their sexual orientation.\nA native of Missouri, Winchell enlisted in the Army in 1997 and was transferred in 1998 to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. As a Private First Class, he was assigned to the 2nd Battalion 502nd Infantry of the 101st Airborne Division. While stationed there, he received a Dear John letter from his high school sweetheart.\nWinchell later accompanied his roommate, Spc. Justin Robert Fisher, 25, and other soldiers for an excursion to Nashville's downtown bars. In 1999, Fisher and others took Winchell to a Nashville club, The Connection, which featured transgender performers, where Winchell met a trans woman showgirl named Calpernia Addams.[1] The two began to date. Fisher began to spread rumors of the relationship at Ft. Campbell. Winchell then became a target of harassment which his superiors did almost nothing to stop.[2]\n",

At the time of her murder she was stationed at Naval Support Activity Mid-South in Millington, Tennessee. Collins was a student undergoing training at the base, and was scheduled to graduate from avionics training on the day of her murder. She is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Suzanne Collins was the daughter of Jack and Trudy Collins. She graduated from John R. Lewis High School in Springfield, Virginia.\nOn the evening of July 11, 1985, Suzanne Marie Collins was abducted while jogging on the base, and was taken to nearby Edmund Orgill Park. There, the kidnapper severely beat Collins, fracturing her skull, before repeatedly shoving a tree limb up her vagina with enough force to penetrate her abdomen and tear one of her lungs. The autopsy would state that Collins died from blunt force trauma to the head and internal hemorrhaging from the tree limb.[1] The kidnapper then ditched the body and fled the scene.\nTwo Marines jogging near where Collins was abducted heard her scream and ran toward the sound. However, as they reached the scene, they saw a car leaving the area. They reported to base security and accompanied officers on a tour of the base, looking for the car. Unsuccessful, they returned to their barracks, but soon the Marines were called back to the security office. There they identified Sedley Alley's car, which had been stopped by officers. Alley and his wife gave statements to the base security personnel accounting for their whereabouts. The security personnel were satisfied with Alley's story, and Alley and his wife returned to their on-base housing. The two Marine witnesses returned to the security office shortly after Alley and his wife departed. The Marines disputed the couple's version of events, citing that the loud, distinct sounds made by the muffler on Alley's car matched those sounds they had heard prior to and during Collins' abduction. The security personnel indicated that since no one had yet been reported missing, there was nothing more that could be done. The Marines were thanked for their assistance and told to return to their barracks.[1]\n",

On IQ tests, he scored an average of between 59 and 69.[2] Mullins eventually dropped out of school in 1977, when he was in his ninth-grade year.

One man was arrested for Bierfield's murder but was released by the judge after seven witnesses provided an alibi for him.[1][2][3] The lynching followed months of increasing political violence locally the year before, including the July 1867 attacks on black Union League members in what was called the Franklin Riot. An estimated 25 to 30 blacks were wounded and three died as a result of that incident, together with one white Conservative. \nRacial and political violence had increased in the area during 1867, especially after African Americans were granted the franchise from the state legislature in February 1867.

Vidar Lillelid (aged 34), Delfina Lillelid (aged 28), and their daughter Tabitha (aged 6), and son Peter (aged 2) were shot on a deserted rural road near Baileyton during a carjacking committed by a group of youths. Vidar and Delfina were found dead at the scene, while Tabitha died after being transported to the hospital. Peter survived, but, as a result of the shooting, was left with disabilities.[1] Six young people from Kentucky, including two minors, were convicted of felony murder for the deaths of Vidar, Delfina, and Tabitha Lillelid, with all six perpetrators receiving three life sentences, and an additional sentence of 25 years each for the attempted murder of Peter Lillelid.[2]\nVidar Lillelid grew up in Bergen, Norway, and in 1985 moved to United States. In 1989, Lillelid married Delfina Zelaya, a first-generation Honduran-American from New York City, whom he had met through their common involvement in the Jehovah's Witnesses denomination.[citation needed]. By 1997, the Lillelids had two children: 6-year-old daughter Tabitha (1990-1997) and 2-year-old son Peter (b.1995).\n",

The Judds ceased performing in 1991 after Naomi was diagnosed with hepatitis; while Wynonna continued to perform as a solo artist, she occasionally reunited with her mother for tours as The Judds. Naomi struggled with mental health issues throughout her life. She died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 30, 2022, the day before she and Wynonna were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.[6]\nJudd was born to Pauline Ruth \"Polly\" (n\u00e9e Oliver) and Charles Glen Judd on January 11, 1946, in Ashland, Kentucky.[7] Her father owned a gas station.[7] Her brother Brian died of leukemia in 1965 at the age of 17;[8] Naomi Judd's first child, Christina Claire Ciminella (later Wynonna Judd), was born when Judd was 18.[9] Her first daughter was given the last name Ciminella after Michael Ciminella, the man who Judd quickly married after being abandoned by her boyfriend and Wynonna's biological father, Charles Jordan.[10] After the birth of her second daughter, Ashley (1968), who later became a film and stage actress, and the end of her marriage to Ciminella, Judd brought up both daughters as a single parent, first attending nursing school at California's College of Marin while living in nearby Lagunitas, California,[11] and later beginning a successful singing career with daughter Wynonna.[12] When she reverted to her maiden name following her divorce, she also took the opportunity to change her name, Diana, which she did not think fit \"her own spiritual, rural Kentucky conception of her true heritage\", and decided to pay homage to the Biblical figure Naomi, finding resonance in her story of moving to another land and eventually being left without a husband raising two women.[7][13]\n",

Police soon reclassified the case as a homicide, despite the absence of Janet's body, and named Perry as a suspect. Shortly afterwards he moved back to his native Chicago area with the couple's two children. After his in-laws won visitation, he fled with the children to Mexico, where his father, Arthur, a former U.S. Army pharmacist, had retired.

At least sixteen people, including one child, were killed during the course of the feud, and many others were seriously injured.[1] The feud took place primarily in the border areas of Hawkins County (formerly part of Sullivan County, North Carolina, one of the earliest Tennessee counties and said to have a large Melungeon population), Washington County, Claiborne County, Hancock County, Tennessee (created when Hawkins County, Tennessee was subdivided), and Lee County, Virginia, not far from Cumberland Gap, the narrow Appalachian Mountain pass sometimes called The Wilderness Road leading into Kentucky.\nMost of the history of this feud is found in family records, particularly in a self-published small-edition book by Alton Lee Greene, a genealogist who lived in Sanger, Texas. Alton Lee Greene (a 20th-century descendant of the feuding families) traced the genealogy of the descendants of American colonist Judge William Greene, a judge in the Court of Common Pleas who was born in Lincolnshire, England in 1671 and died in 1722 in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.[2] Judge Greene married Joanna \"Hannah\" Reeder, the daughter of John Reeder and Joanna  Burroughs Reeder, who was born in 1699 in Newtown, Long Island, New York.  Judge William Greene and Hannah settled in the area of Ewing, New Jersey and built the William Green House (Ewing Township, New Jersey), now on the National Historic Register and located on the campus of The College of New Jersey. Despite fund-raising efforts, the old farmhouse near where the troops of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River once rested during the Revolutionary War, has never been fully restored.[3]\nJudge William Greene and Joanna Reeder Greene were the great-grandparents of Jeremiah Greene, who along with other Greene relatives migrated to an area near Rowan, North Carolina (a vast county of indefinite boundaries formed in 1753), where they formed a community called The Jersey Settlement by joining West Jersey residents who left New Jersey due to their unwillingness to adhere to the demands of Colonel Daniel Coxe, an English Colonial landowner and physician. Disgusted by Coxe's rampant political corruption, the Greene family settled near the Yadkin River in North Carolina and started the Jersey Settlement Meeting House, now on the National Historic Register. Jeremiah's family migrated to the Jersey Settlement and then to Hancock County, Tennessee, where his descendants figured prominently in the Greene\u2013Jones War.[4]\n",

It resulted in the death of a Tennessee Department of Correction transport officer, and the wounding of another officer. The perpetrator, Jennifer Forsyth Hyatte (born February 11, 1974), began shooting immediately after her husband, George, pleaded guilty to a robbery charge in the courthouse. \nJennifer Hyatte is currently serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. George Hyatte pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the shooting in 2009 and was sentenced to life in prison as part of a plea bargain to avoid the death penalty.[1]\nAt approximately 10:00\u00a0a.m., after a court hearing, Tennessee Department of Corrections transport officer Wayne \"Cotton\" Morgan was fatally shot three times by Jennifer Forsyth Hyatte, whose husband, George Hyatte, pleaded guilty to a charge of robbery. Officer Morgan and his partner were loading prisoners into a transport van after a court appearance, when Jennifer Forsythe Hyatte drove up and opened fire with a handgun, striking Officer Morgan three times in the abdomen. Officer Morgan's partner returned fire as the escaping prisoner climbed inside his wife's vehicle. Jennifer Forsythe Hyatte was a former nurse at a prison where George Hyatte had been an inmate. She had been fired after she was found sneaking food to George. \n",

For his crimes, he was convicted, sentenced to death and subsequently executed at the Tennessee State Prison in 1926.[1]\nLittle is known about Barr's early life. He was born in Memphis in 1903, the only son of a Baptist minister.[1] As an adult, he married a woman named Luada and the couple lived happily in the city, with Charles working as a chauffeur and house servant for the Van Fossan family, where he was treated decently and regarded as a honest worker.[2] Despite his reputation, Barr wished for a more lavish lifestyle, believing the quickest way to do so was to turn to robberies.\nOn January 27, 1923, Barr borrowed a car from a friend and drove to an isolated road near Memphis, which was known as a local lovers' lane. There, he came across 21-year-old salesman Duncan Waller from Mayfield, Kentucky and his mistress, Ruth McElwaine Tucker of Bowling Green.[3] He parked the car near them and approached them on foot, and upon reaching the automobile, he pulled out a .25 caliber pistol and shot Waller, killing him instantly. Frightened, Tucker leaped out of the car and sprinted towards a nearby field, but Barr caught up with her, raped her and then shot her as well.[4] After killing her, he stole the woman's jewelry and valuables before returning to the car and doing the same to Waller, and then fleeing the area. Their bodies were later discovered by a milkman doing his daily routine. Despite the police's and local citizen's detective agencies attempts to solve the case, nobody was arrested for the crime at the time.[4]\n",

The riot began when a lynch mob stormed the county jail in search of Maurice Mays, a biracial man who had been accused of murdering a white woman. Unable to find Mays, the rioters looted the jail and fought a pitched gun battle with the residents of a predominantly black neighborhood. The Tennessee National Guard, which at one point fired two machine guns indiscriminately into this neighborhood, eventually dispersed the rioters.[1][2][3] At the end of August 1919 the Great Falls Daily Tribune reported four killed in a \"race war riot\"[4] while the Washington Times reported \"Scores dead.\"[5] Other newspapers placed the death toll at just two, though eyewitness accounts suggest it was much higher.[1]\nThe Riot of 1919 was one of several violent racial incidents that occurred during the so-called Red Summer when race riots plagued cities across the United States.  The riot was one of the worst racial episodes in Knoxville's history and shattered the city's vision of itself as a racially tolerant Southern town.[6] After the riot, many black residents left Knoxville, and racial violence continued to flare up sporadically in subsequent years.[1]\nIn the decades following the Civil War, Knoxville was considered by both black and white residents to be one of the few racially tolerant cities in the South. It was one of the few where black citizens could vote, hold public office, and serve as police officers.[1] In 1918, Charles W. Cansler (1871\u20131953), one of the city's leading African-American citizens, wrote to the governor of Tennessee, \"In no place in the world can there be found better relations existing between the races than here in our own county of Knox. No race riots have ever disgraced our city and no mob has ever vented its fury here upon any Negro victim.\"[1]\n",

He was sentenced on July 8, 2006 and is currently incarcerated at the Northwest Correctional Complex, which is located in Tiptonville, Tennessee.

Its name is something of a misnomer, because it was never located near the center of Knoxville, even when Fountain City was annexed into Knoxville in the early 1960s.  The northernmost high school in Knoxville before the annexation of Fountain City was Fulton, and in the county, Powell, Karns, and Halls high schools were farther north.\nOn August 21, 2008, 15-year-old student Jamar Siler entered the school cafeteria and approached student Ryan McDonald sitting at a lunch table. Siler fatally shot McDonald, and was arrested by authorities a short time later. The two had been in previous altercations, the details of which were not released to the general public.

Two more victims were discovered the next day and a victim who survived her wounds. One of the deceased victims was a 12-year-old girl who was partially nude but no sexual assault occurred. All the victim deaths were caused by blunt force trauma to the head.[4]\nCummins was going to be arrested in the upcoming days before the bodies were found due to a violation of probation of not having a mental health evaluation. A warrant was in the works.[6] After the murders, Cummins was a suspect due to not being seen and his family's untimely deaths. Cummins was later spotted and shot after he was cornered near a creek by multiple police officers. However, his trial was delayed many time due to COVID. On June 9, 2022, he was found fit to stand trial. His trial will start April 2023.[7]\n",

He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment on one count in Tennessee, and the other charges were dropped altogether.[1]\nWilliam Scott Day was born on an American military installation in Japan on October 21, 1951, while his family was residing there. From an early age, he showed signs of remarkable intelligence and an affinity for reading authors such as Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman and Barbara W. Tuchman.[2] After the death of his father during his teens, Day moved to Michigan, where he enlisted in the Marine Corps and was stationed at a boot camp near Flat Rock. While there, he deserted his position and went to the city, where he was later arrested for attempting to rape and kidnap a woman. Day was convicted of this crime and given a 7-year term, served initially at the Richard A. Handlon Correctional Facility and later transferred to the Ionia Correctional Facility, successfully escaping once before being paroled in 1974.[2]\nBetween 1976 and 1982, Day was repeatedly arrested and incarcerated for various offenses including heroin possession, theft, kidnapping and writing bad checks, successfully escaping on one occasion. In late 1982, Day escaped from yet another prison camp in Caro, and thereafter kidnapped an 80-year-old woman, whom he robbed and then tied to a tree.[2] He was arrested and given an additional 7-year sentence, which he was to serve at the Michigan State Prison in Jackson. However, as he suffered from depression, Day was transferred for temporary treatment at the Center For Forensic Psychiatry in Ypsilanti.[3] During his stay, he was described as a model patient who frequently played chess with employees and even helped break up assaults by other patients. Through these activities, he became friendly with 36-year-old security worker Thomas Frederick Fortunato, a veteran employee of 14 years who was assigned to the center's C-43 ward, which was notorious for housing violent inmates.[4]\n",

The riot began when a lynch mob stormed the county jail in search of Maurice Mays, a biracial man who had been accused of murdering a white woman. Unable to find Mays, the rioters looted the jail and fought a pitched gun battle with the residents of a predominantly black neighborhood. The Tennessee National Guard, which at one point fired two machine guns indiscriminately into this neighborhood, eventually dispersed the rioters.[1][2][3] At the end of August 1919 the Great Falls Daily Tribune reported four killed in a \"race war riot\"[4] while the Washington Times reported \"Scores dead.\"[5] Other newspapers placed the death toll at just two, though eyewitness accounts suggest it was much higher.[1]\nThe Riot of 1919 was one of several violent racial incidents that occurred during the so-called Red Summer when race riots plagued cities across the United States.  The riot was one of the worst racial episodes in Knoxville's history and shattered the city's vision of itself as a racially tolerant Southern town.[6] After the riot, many black residents left Knoxville, and racial violence continued to flare up sporadically in subsequent years.[1]\nIn the decades following the Civil War, Knoxville was considered by both black and white residents to be one of the few racially tolerant cities in the South. It was one of the few where black citizens could vote, hold public office, and serve as police officers.[1] In 1918, Charles W. Cansler (1871\u20131953), one of the city's leading African-American citizens, wrote to the governor of Tennessee, \"In no place in the world can there be found better relations existing between the races than here in our own county of Knox. No race riots have ever disgraced our city and no mob has ever vented its fury here upon any Negro victim.\"[1]\n",

During the struggle, both McAdoo and his rival, C.C. Howell, along with the mayor, chief of police, fire chief, and over 200 workers, were arrested by one side or the other.  One person was killed and several injured in accompanying mob violence.[2]\nThe incident was the culmination of a two-year struggle between McAdoo and Howell for control of Knoxville's streetcar system.  McAdoo had gained control of the bulk of the system in the early 1890s, and successfully converted the system to electric power.[2]  This conversion proved costly, however, and his company was forced into bankruptcy.  A syndicate led by Howell purchased most of the company's assets, but McAdoo maintained control of several routes,[1] and the two filed suits and countersuits as they attempted to outposition the other.  After this incident, McAdoo left Knoxville, and Howell consolidated the city's streetcar lines.[3]\nKnoxville's first streetcar company, the Knoxville Street Railway, was organized in the mid-1870s, and used streetcars pulled by mules or horses.[1]  In 1887, William Gibbs McAdoo (1862\u20131941), then a young attorney, organized the Elmwood Street Railway Company, which used streetcars that were steam-powered instead of horse-drawn.  Three years later, McAdoo reorganized the company as the Rapid Transit Company, which became the first in the city to use electric-powered streetcars.[1]\n",

Originally convicted in the 1977 murder of a prostitute in Nashville, Tennessee and suspected in at least two similar killings, Williams later escaped from prison and murdered a police officer and a priest within days of one another in 1981.[1] He was separately sentenced to death for both murders, but was killed by fellow inmates on death row in 1985 before he could be executed.[2]\nMuch of Williams' early life is shrouded in mystery. During an interview on death row, he said that he was born somewhere outside of the United States in 1949, the second of six children of a father serving in the Army.[3] Williams claimed that he saw little of his father when he was little, as he  was serving in Korea, but after the war ended, he returned and the family moved to Louisiana.[3] Williams told that he entered high school in a town called \"Newardton\", a presumably fictitious location as no records of such a place existing in the state have been located, before moving to Southern California. While there, he finished high school and supposedly spent a year and a half in college studying psychology, but again, he refused to disclose the exact location.[3] During the 1970s, he drifted around various parts of the country before permanently settling in Chicago, Illinois.[3]\nCirca August or early October 1977, Williams went to stay at a friend's apartment at the Pagoda Garden Apartments in Nashville.[4] On October 18, he solicited the services of a 19-year-old prostitute, Terra Wedlaw, who had arrived in the city just two months earlier from Tampa, Florida.[4] The pair went to the Capitol Park Inn to have sex, but after they had finished, Williams strangled her and fled the premises. Just a few weeks later, he was arrested on murder charges by local authorities, after the woman's birth certificate was found in his possession.[4] While he awaited his trial, it was publicly announced that Williams was a suspect in two similar murders that had occurred in Nashville: the strangulation murders of prostitute Mary Jo Corn (alias Larisa Ann Marsay) and bank teller Bessie Wallace, both 24.[4] Both women were found nude and strangled in areas near the city, their hands and feet tied with rope, and each was killed months within one another. As the killings were similar to that of Wedlaw, authorities suspected that Williams was their killer, and he was also under investigation for other similar murders in places such as Atlanta and Columbus, Georgia; Portland, Oregon; Washington and his residence in Chicago.[4]\n",

The CVR, though, was switched back on by the flight engineer, believing that he had neglected to turn it on.[3]\nCalloway intended to use the speargun as a last resort. He planned to crash the aircraft hoping that he would appear to be an employee killed in an accident. He sought to let his family collect on a $2.5 million life insurance policy provided by Federal Express.[3] Calloway's efforts to kill the crew were unsuccessful.

Founded in 1932 by activist Myles Horton, educator Don West, and Methodist minister James A. Dombrowski, it was originally located in the community of Summerfield in Grundy County, Tennessee, between Monteagle and Tracy City. It was featured in the 1985 documentary film, You Got to Move. Much of the history was documented in the book Or We'll All Hang Separately: The Highlander Idea by Thomas Bledsoe.\nHighlander provides training and education for emerging and existing movement leaders throughout the South, Appalachia, and the world. Some of Highlander's earliest contributions were during the labor movement in Appalachia and throughout the Southern United States. During the 1950s, it played a critical role in the American Civil Rights Movement. It trained civil rights leader Rosa Parks prior to her historic role in the Montgomery bus boycott, as well as providing training for many other movement activists, including members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Septima Clark, Anne Braden, Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, Hollis Watkins, Bernard Lafayette, Ralph Abernathy and John Lewis in the mid- and-late 1950s. Backlash against the school's involvement with the Civil Rights Movement led to the school's closure by the state of Tennessee in 1961. Staff reorganized and moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, where they rechartered Highlander under the name \"Highlander Research and Education Center.\" Highlander has been in its current (and longest consecutive) home in New Market, Tennessee, since 1971. Highlander's archives reside at the Wisconsin Historical Society and the Louis Round Wilson Library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nThe Highlander Folk School was originally established in Grundy County, Tennessee, on land donated for this purpose by educator Lilian Wyckoff Johnson.[1] When Highlander was founded in 1932, the United States was in the midst of the Great Depression. Workers in all parts of the country were met with major resistance by employers when they tried to organize labor unions, especially in the South. Against that backdrop, Horton, West and Dombrowski created the Highlander School \"to provide an educational center in the South for the training of rural and industrial leaders, and for the conservation and enrichment of the indigenous cultural values of the mountains.\" Horton was influenced by observing rural adult education schools in Denmark started in the 19th century by Danish Lutheran Bishop N. F. S. Grundtvig.[2] During the 1930s and 1940s, the school's main focus was labor education and the training of labor organizers. In the 1930s, Myra Page taught here.[3]\n",

About an hour later, Holton turned himself in to the Shelbyville police; he told investigators that he had killed the children because \"families should stay together; a father should be with his children.\" He said he had also planned to kill his ex-wife and then himself, but had changed his mind.[2][3]\nAt his June 1999 trial, Holton declined to testify on his own behalf, although his attorney sought to convince the jury that Holton was mentally incompetent at the time of the killings. Witnesses for the defense testified that Holton showed signs of carbon monoxide poisoning, although they could not definitively conclude that he had been exposed to carbon monoxide. Psychiatrists for the state and the defense also testified that Holton had major depressive disorder and passive-aggressive personality disorder at the time of the murders. The jury rejected the insanity defense; Holton was found guilty and sentenced to death.[4]\n",

He was executed by hanging, the first such execution to occur in Hamblen County, Tennessee.\nBlair lived with his stepdaughter Maggie in Washington County near Jonesborough. Maggie had left Blair's house and, from May 1879, lived and worked for William Donaldson in Hamblen County. She was described as very smart and industrious. Blair learned of her whereabouts and on July 29 went to Russellville, Tennessee, immediately making his way to the Donaldson residence. He entered the kitchen, where Maggie was preparing dinner with Mrs. Donaldson. Blair told Maggie that he had something to say to her and asked her to come outside the house. She refused, saying he could say what he had to say in front of Mrs. Donaldson. Around this time, William Donaldson rode up and Blair immediately left the house.[1]\nThe following night on Wednesday, Maggie went with others to the prayer meeting at the black church near Russellville. Returning, Blair passed on persons who had been to the church service. He headed on to Russellville after some conversation but after going a short distance, turned back and took another road where the young people, including Maggie, had taken. He overtook the party and immediately walked up to his stepdaughter, who was walking in the rear with a black boy named Taylor. Pushing Taylor away, he caught her hand and said: \"You must go home with me on the train tonight to your grandpa\", and pulled her along the road 150 to 200 yards, saying she should go. Maggie struggled to loosen herself from his grasp, saying she would rather die than go, whereupon he drew a pistol and shot her twice. She died the following Saturday, aged 16.[1]\n",

At a hearing before the same judge who conducted the trial, the court dismissed the petition, deeming House's trial counsel adequate and overruling House's other objections.

The native of Louisville, Kentucky, served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.[1]\nSchultz came to the Major Leagues at age 27 after posting seasons of 20, 16 and 25 victories in minor league baseball.[2] His 25-win season in 1950 was especially noteworthy as it came with the Nashville Vols of the Class AA Southern Association, who played their home games in a hitter's paradise called Sulphur Dell. Schultz lost only six decisions and finished second in the league in earned run average (2.68), just one one-hundredth of a point behind ERA champion Marv Rotblatt (2.67).[3] Schultz broke camp with the 1951 Cubs out of spring training and appeared in 17 games \u2014 ten as a starting pitcher \u2014 during the season's early months, but he was sent back to the minors after his last start July 13, when he was knocked out of the box after only one full inning in a start against the Brooklyn Dodgers.[4]\nSchultz spent the entire 1952 campaign with the Cubs, working in 29 games and winning six of nine decisions. In his finest outing, September 14 at Braves Field, Schultz pitched a ten-inning complete game victory over the Boston Braves, allowing only two runs and six hits \u2014 and winning the game for himself with an RBI double.[5] It would be his ninth and final victory in Major League Baseball.\n",

        "paragraph": "Henry Choate was an African-American man who was lynched by a mob in Columbia, Tennessee, on November 13, 1927.[1] Accused of having attacked a white girl, he was taken to the Columbia jail, from which a mob numbering hundreds of people sprang him. They killed him there, dragged him through the city behind a car, and than hanged the body from the courthouse.\nHenry Choate was eighteen years old when he was murdered. He was working on a road construction project in Coffee County, Tennessee, and went to Columbia on Armistice Day to visit his grandfather, Henry Clay Harlan, who was 85 years old, born into slavery, and lived about seven miles west of Columbia. During that visit a young white girl claimed she had been attacked by a young Black man. The sheriff of Maury County, Sam Wiley, brought in a pack of bloodhounds. Choate was arrested and put in the county jail, and the sheriff's wife, Mrs. Wiley, alerted the \"Negro cook of the jail\", Mrs. Ella Gant, that a group of men were going to come and kill Choate. Gant brought him cigarettes and told him the news, and that he should pray; he said he knew this was going to happen, but didn't pray and remained proud. When the mob came, Mrs. Wiley hid the keys and told the mob she wasn't going see \"an innocent boy hung\". But when a man started pounding at the jail door with a hammer, and the use of dynamite was threatened, she procured the key.[2] The mob, some 250 men,[3] opened the jail, got Choate out, and someone hit him with a hammer on the head. They then tied him to a truck (he had apparently died already) and dragged him through the streets, and up into the courthouse.[2] There he was hanged, from the second story of the County Courthouse in Columbia, which was still decorated for Armistice Day.[4]\nCoordinates: 35\u00b036\u203254\u2033N 87\u00b02\u203240\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff35.61500\u00b0N 87.04444\u00b0W\ufeff / 35.61500; -87.04444\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Benton fireworks disaster was an industrial disaster that occurred on May 27, 1983, on a farm near Benton, Tennessee. A powerful explosion at an unlicensed fireworks factory producing illegal fireworks killed eleven and injured one, revealing the existence of the factory for the first time to law enforcement and the public. The initial explosion was heard more than 20\u00a0mi (32\u00a0km) away.\nThe event gained national attention, covered by multiple media outlets, and triggered a two-year federal investigation that eventually led to the conviction of 21 people including the owner of the factory, a man who was considered to be the mastermind, and several others from multiple states who conspired to manufacture, transport, and/or allow the fireworks manufactured at the operation to be transported. Investigators determined the factory to have been the largest and most profitable known illegal fireworks operation in US history.[1][2] The disaster was the deadliest event in US history involving illegal fireworks.[3]\n",

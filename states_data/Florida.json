White's execution was noteworthy due to witnesses reporting that White had an unusual reaction to the electricity. Later two separate death row inmates, Phillip Atkins and Thomas Harrison Provenzano, would attempt to use White's execution as evidence that Florida's electric chair was malfunctioning and subjected death row inmates to cruel and unusual punishment.\nJerry White was born on February 12, 1948,[1] in Quincy, Florida. White grew up in an environment of poverty and instability. He never met his biological father, and his stepfather, a sharecropper, was murdered when White was a child.[2] White's mother, Mabel Pinkins, worked as a maid and was rarely home during White's childhood. White began drinking alcohol when he was a teenager. When he was 14, he was arrested for the first time for burglary. He was sentenced to serve one year in a reform school in Marianna, Florida, where he reported being beaten. Following his release, White's mother noted that his personality suddenly changed and that he seemed \"quiet and withdrawn for a long, long time.\"[3] He began drinking alcohol when he was 15. White subsequently dropped out of school and developed an addiction to heroin.[2]\nPrior to the crime for which he was executed, White accumulated a long history of arrests for crimes including attempted murder, robbery, larceny, and burglary. In 1977, White was convicted of three counts of robbery and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was released from prison in March 1980, a year prior to the robbery of the Alexander Grocery Store.[4] Overall, prior to 1981, White had accumulated nine felony convictions.[5]\n",

Because of this, Stiles performed under the stage name \"Lobster Boy\".\nAccording to Grady's father, the Stiles family had a long history of ectrodactyly, dating back to 1840. Grady Stiles Jr. was the fourth child of Grady F. Stiles Sr. and his wife Edna. Capitalizing on his deformity, Grady Stiles Sr. was a sideshow attraction in a traveling carnival. After Grady Jr. was born he was folded into his father's sideshow act at the age of seven.[1] Stiles married twice and had four children, two of whom also had ectrodactyly. Stiles and his two children toured together as The Lobster Family. When not traveling with the carnival, the Stiles family lived in Gibsonton, Florida, where many other carnival performers lived during the winter season.\nStiles was an alcoholic and was abusive to his family.[1] Due to his ectrodactyly, he was unable to walk. While he sometimes used a wheelchair, he most commonly used his hands and arms for locomotion. He developed substantial upper body strength that, when combined with his bad temper and alcoholism, made him dangerous to others.\n",

Knowles claimed to have murdered three people on the streets of San Francisco that night, but that has never been verified.\nKnowles returned to Jacksonville, Florida. He was soon arrested after stabbing a bartender during a fight, but he picked a lock in his detention cell and escaped on July 26, 1974.\n",

Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes tied to a concrete block around their necks. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted billboards bearing enlarged images of the suspect's handwriting recovered from a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting.\nPrior to his arrest, Chandler worked as an unlicensed aluminum-siding contractor. Against the advice of his attorneys, he testified in his own defense, saying he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions. Chandler said he never saw them again, except in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution. During his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he did not have a single visitor.\n",

German authorities suspect he may have killed several local women when he was stationed there with the U.S. Army during the early 1990s. Typically, Durousseau would gain the victim's trust, enter the victim's home, tie their hands, rape, then strangle them to death.[2] All of his known victims were young, single African-American women.\nPaul Durousseau was born in Beaumont, Texas. In 1970, he moved in with his mother's family in Los Angeles after his father, unwed to his mother, deserted them. Little else is known publicly about Durousseau's childhood. After graduating high school, 19-year-old Durousseau found himself working as a security guard. His first offenses as an adult took place on December 18, 1991, and January 21, 1992, for carrying a concealed firearm in California.[3]\nIn November 1992, Durousseau enlisted in the U.S. Army[3] and was stationed in Germany, where he met Natoca, who would later become his wife. The two married in 1995 in Las Vegas. In 1996, they were transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia. On March 13, 1997, Durousseau was arrested for kidnapping and raping a young woman. However, in August of that year he was cleared of those charges. Soon after, he was found in possession of stolen goods.

After initially confessing but later recanting his statements, he pleaded guilty to two of the murders in exchange for a 25-to-life sentence and no further charges in the other murders. A few years after his conviction, he died behind bars from AIDS complications.\nJeffrey Lynn Feltner was born on November 21, 1962, in Miami, Florida. His parents split up three months before his birth, with his father Kasper moving to Michigan while Feltner remained with his mother, Shirley.[1] The pair moved to Melrose in 1979, where Feltner attended and later graduated from the Interlachen High School. Considered a loner by most of his peers, he started spending a majority of his time visiting gay bars and similar establishments around the area. During one sexual encounter, he contracted HIV, which progressively worsened over time.[1]\nIn 1986, Feltner's mother helped him get a job at the New Life Acres nursing home in Melrose, where she worked as a nursing assistant. After only a few months on the job, he was promoted to supervising other nurses' aides and was greatly respected by both patients and staff. In 1987, Feltner temporarily quit his job for two months so he could locate his birth father, and after succeeding in doing so, he returned to Melrose and was rehired.[1]\n",

On March 25 of that year, Hampton shot at three Caucasian men; Sessom Calhoun and John Bell were killed while J. W.

At least six black people and two white people were killed, but eyewitness accounts suggested a higher death toll of 27 to 150. The town of Rosewood was destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black men in the years before the massacre,[2] including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.[citation needed]\nBefore the massacre, the town of Rosewood had been a quiet, primarily black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been assaulted by a black drifter. A mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. For several days, survivors from the town hid in nearby swamps until they were evacuated to larger towns by train and car. No arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black and white residents; none of them ever moved back, none of them were ever compensated for the loss of their land, and the town ceased to exist.\nAlthough the rioting was widely reported around the United States at the time, few official records documented the event. The survivors, their descendants, and the perpetrators all remained silent about Rosewood for decades. Sixty years after the rioting, the story of Rosewood was revived by major media outlets when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s. The survivors and their descendants all organized in an attempt to sue the state for failing to protect Rosewood's black community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned a report on the incident. As a result of the findings, Florida compensated the survivors and their descendants for the damages which they had incurred because of racial violence. The incident was the subject of a 1997 feature film which was directed by John Singleton. In 2004, the state designated the site of Rosewood as a Florida Heritage Landmark.\n",

Szymankiewicz and checked into a hotel in Tallahassee, Florida. The two had been on an apparent robbery spree.[2] The two got into a heated argument, Spenkelink left the hotel room and upon his return shot Szymankiewicz in the back and beat him with a hatchet.[2][3][4]\nLess than a week later, Spenkelink was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery in Buena Park, California and the murder weapon was found in an apartment of one of Spenkelink's associates.\n",

        "paragraph": "The Flat-Tire murders were a series of unsolved murders in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties, Florida, occurring between February 1975 and January 1976. The name originated from the investigators' belief that, when the offender committed two of the murders, he had deflated the tires of the victims' cars. The list of suspected victims ultimately included 12 girls and women whose bodies were discovered in or near South Florida canals.[1] Some forensic experts have questioned whether a single offender was responsible for all the murders, while others have proclaimed that the murderer might have killed more than 30 women in multiple states.[2] The murders were the subject of a 2021 book, The Flat Tire Murders: Unsolved Crimes of a South Florida Serial Killer.\nThe first murder victim of the Flat-Tire murderer was 27-year-old respiratory therapist Ronnie Sue Gorlin, who went missing on July 22, 1975 after leaving her Miami Beach apartment to visit her mother at Parkway Hospital.[3] The next day, her naked body was found in the Graham Canal, with signs that she had been sexually assaulted and then stabbed to death. Her car, a rented burgundy-white Oldsmobile Cutlass, was found in a shopping center parking lot with a slashed tire.[4] Eight days later, 21-year-old Elyse Rapp, originally from New York City, left her apartment to go shopping, and was last seen at a Hollywood mall in the evening before vanishing. Her car, a rented yellow Chevrolet Vega, was found in the mall's parking lot, also with a deflated tire. The day after, Rapp's body was found in the same canal where Gorlin's body was found earlier.[3] Both women shared the characteristics of being found naked, except for a necklace with the Hebrew inscription for \"life\" around Rapp's neck and a single sandal on one of Gorlin's feet.[5] Following a forensic autopsy, it was determined that Rapp's cause of death was drowning, but she had been sexually assaulted prior to her death. In both of these cases, the killer had chosen young women who traveled in cars by themselves. In their absence, he had deflated their vehicles' tires, after which he waited for them to return and then offered to fix their tires, presenting himself as a good samaritan.[5]\nAfter the discovery of Gorlin and Rapp's bodies, the police first suggested that there was a serial killer active in two counties. According to them, a total of 12 young women killed in South Florida might've been victims of the same offender. The first of them was 20-year-old Judith Ann Oesterling, from Indiana, who went missing on February 1, 1975 from Miami-Dade County after returning home from her job at a massage parlor. Two days later, her body was found in the canal bordering Broward and Miami-Dade. A few days after that, not far from where Oesterling was found, the body of 17-year-old divorcee Arietta Tinker was found in the canal.[6]\n",

He would typically approach his victims in public places, either feigning a physical impairment such as an injury, or impersonating an authority figure, before bludgeoning them into unconsciousness and taking them to secondary locations to be raped and strangled. Bundy often revisited his victims, grooming and performing sexual acts with the corpses until decomposition and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. At least twelve of his victims were decapitated and their severed heads kept as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, he broke into homes at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.\n",

Shakespeare had chosen a one-time, lump sum cash payment of $17 million.[4] He moved out of his working-class neighborhood in Lakeland, Florida and into a gated community.[5] Several months after his lottery win, apart from a $1 million home, his only other major purchases included a Nissan Altima and a Rolex watch from a pawnshop.[6] By late January 2010 the sheriff involved in the investigation of Shakespeare's disappearance told AP that the lottery money \"is gone now.\"[7]\n",

Sullivan had previously been employed at the restaurant for eight months as an assistant manager in 1972. At the restaurant, the pair encountered 38-year-old Donald Schmidt, the new assistant manager who worked there. Schmidt was abducted, had his hands tied behind his back with tape, and was then taken by the pair to a remote area in a swamp located in the Everglades. He was forced onto the ground where he was hit with a tire iron. He was then fatally shot four times in the back of the head by a 12 gauge shotgun. Schmidt was robbed of both his credit cards and a watch.[6]\n",

Sentenced to death in Florida and to life imprisonment in Georgia and North Carolina, Hilton remains a suspect in several other killings, including that of Judy Smith.\nOn October 21, 2007, a retired couple of avid hikers living in Horse Shoe, North Carolina,[2] John and Irene Bryant (80 and 84, respectively), left for a hike through the Pisgah National Forest, leaving their parked maroon Ford Escape at the Yellow Gap Road near U.S. Route 276. After not hearing from them for two weeks, family members reported the couple as missing to the Henderson County Sheriff's Office, who promptly launched a search for the Bryants, consisting of more than 30 volunteers, cadaver dogs and a helicopter. Through examining their phone records, it was learned that Irene had attempted to call 911 on the day of her disappearance, but the signal was lost, and the call was dropped.[3]\nOn November 10, 2007 the search party located the body of a woman on the Barnett Branch trail, covered with leaves. Suspecting that it might belong to Irene, they sent it to the state medical examiner's office in Chapel Hill to perform an autopsy.[4] Three days later, the body was positively identified as that of Irene, who had been bludgeoned to death with a blunt instrument.[5] As this was now considered a homicide perpetrated on federal land, the FBI launched an investigation with an award of $10,000 to whoever could provide information leading to the killer. Simultaneously, it was revealed that a bank card belonging to the Bryants had been used to withdraw $300 from an ATM in Ducktown, Tennessee, with the surveillance cameras showing an older Caucasian man wearing a yellow rainjacket whose hood was obscuring his face.[6] By this time, John was still considered a missing person, possibly abducted by whoever had killed his wife.[7]\n",

Due to this, he was arrested on January 3, 1964, and charged with the killings.[8] Not long after, he confessed, though claimed he was suffering from insanity.[9] In November, Washington pleaded guilty to the murders, and the following month was sentenced to serve three life sentences. In 1969, he was denied a retrial. In 1970, Washington attempted to appeal his convictions through a federal court. However, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied reviewing his case.[10]\n",

Shortly before the shooting, Drejka approached McGlockton's car and began to confront McGlockton's girlfriend for parking in a disabled parking space without a placard. McGlockton came out of the store and shoved Drejka to the ground. At this point, Drejka drew his handgun and McGlockton began to back away. Five seconds after Drejka hit the ground, he shot McGlockton. McGlockton later died from his injuries at a local hospital. He was unarmed at the time he was shot.[1]\nDrejka, a 47-year-old man, was not initially charged for the killing by the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, with Sheriff Bob Gualtieri citing Florida's stand-your-ground law as the reason. The investigation was then handed over to the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida State Attorney Bernie McCabe, who charged Drejka with one count of manslaughter on August 13, 2018. Drejka pleaded not guilty to the charge. His trial began on August 19, 2019. Drejka was convicted of manslaughter on August 23, 2019, and was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty years on October 10, 2019.[2] The incident was widely reported by news media as another instance of Florida's controversial stand-your-ground law, six years after the killing of Trayvon Martin generated international attention and debate.[3]\nMarkeis Deon McGlockton (March 28, 1990 \u2013 July 19, 2018)[4][5] grew up in Clearwater, Florida, and formerly lived in St. Petersburg.[6] Within Pinellas County Schools, McGlockton attended middle school in St. Petersburg; and attended Boca Ciega High School but later dropped out.[6]\n",

As the Rector's watched the television, Gaskin unloaded his rifle into the home, hitting Joseph. Joseph was able to run out of the room. Mary and Joseph took coverage in a closet until they heard Gaskin smash the back window, so they ran out to the car, where Gaskin started firing at them from inside the house.

On December 6, Cubrit Dixon, a black man coming from Madison County into Taylor County, was stopped and told to put his hands up by armed citizens who had been deputized. Dixon was shot and killed when he did not comply, and witnesses said he had seemed to be reaching for a gun in his back pocket.

The family was below the poverty line, and Christine did not receive the necessary early childhood support. Because of this, she was considered mentally challenged; she also suffered from epilepsy.\nWhen her parents could no longer afford to support her, and also because of ongoing arguments between them, Christine spent some of her childhood and youth in various orphanages. She began killing small animals, especially domestic cats, at an early age. In order to test their \"nine lives\", as she later justified her actions, she often caused the animals to fall from heights.[2]\n",

Circumstantial evidence was collected against him, but nothing directly linked him to the crime. When the news got out about his arrest, white lynch mobs began to form.[2] In order to keep Neal safe, County Sheriff Flake Chambliss moved him between multiple jails, including the county jail at Brewton, Alabama, 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away. But a lynch mob of about 100 white men from Jackson County heard where he was, and brought him back to Jackson County.[3]\nThe time and place of the lynching were provided to the news media in advance and reported on nationwide, attracting a huge crowd.[4]:\u200a126\u200a The spectacle lynching had been announced to take place at the Cannady farm, but the crowd had grown unruly, and a smaller group murdered Neal in secret. He was tortured and mutilated before being hanged by the instigators at a site along the Chattahoochee River, near Greenwood, Florida. They tied his body to the back of their truck and dragged his corpse to the Cannady farm, where a white crowd estimated at 2,000 attacked the corpse by stabbing it with sticks and knives.[2] Later that night Neal's body was hanged from a tree in the courthouse square. When the sheriff discovered it in the morning, he cut it down.[3][5]\nA large group of white people went to the courthouse in Marianna, demanding that the body be hanged again so they could see it. When the sheriff refused, they began rioting, assaulting the courthouse, attacking black people in the area, injuring 200, and looting and burning houses. The body was displayed on the courthouse steps so that anyone interested could see it.[4]\n",

During the subsequent investigation, witnesses reported that they had seen the woman riding accompanied by a skinny, long-haired man on a black bike.[4]\nThere were no leads in the case for five months, until a detective from Fort Lauderdale, John Curcio, saw a program airing the case on TV. He had been a member of an investigative unit which had captured Ronald Henry Stewart, a serial rapist who had terrorized women in Broward County and Harrison County, Mississippi during the late 1980s,[5] and took notice that Stewart resembled the suspect sketch, in addition to being in possession of a black bike at the time of his arrest.[4] A witness who said they had seen Regina and her alleged killer on the beach pointed to Ronald as the man she had seen, and he was soon charged with Harrison's murder. In order to avoid the death penalty, Stewart entered a plea of no contest and was given 50 years imprisonment in January 1985, to run concurrently with his other sentences for the sexual offenses.[3] Although several factors pointed towards his innocence in the case, including the fact that his fingerprints did not match those found at the crime scene, Stewart confessed to the crime. He never repudiated the confession nor claimed it was coerced while serving his time.[4] Stewart died behind bars from cancer in 2008.[5]\n",

In addition, mobsters such as Florida mobster Santo Trafficante Sr. soon set up rival smuggling rings.

Prior to Owens' case, sentences of this severity had not been imposed in the South on white men accused of raping black women.[2] For example, in the case of Recy Taylor, who was gang-raped by six white men in Alabama, the men were never found guilty of any charges and released from jail with minimal fines.[3]\nOn May 2, 1959, four white men, William Collinsworth, Ollie Stoutamire, Patrick Scarborough, and David Beagles, set out together to find a woman to sexually assault. They approached a car at Jake Gaither Park armed with shotguns and switchblades. Patrick Scarborough pressed his shotgun against the African American driver's nose and ordered the occupants out of the car.[4] Four African Americans stepped out of the car, two men and two women. All four people in the car were students at Florida A&M University (FAMU). Scarborough forced the two black men to kneel on the ground, and David Beagles held the two black women at knifepoint. Scarborough ordered the black men, Richard Brown and Thomas Butterfield, to leave and they slowly drove away.[5]\nThe two black women left at the hands of the four white men were Edna Richardson and Betty Jean Owens. Edna Richardson broke free of the men and ran into a nearby park, leaving Betty Jean Owens alone with her attackers. Beagles promised to release her only if she did what they wanted her to do.[6] They drove her to the edge of town and subsequently raped her seven times. Edna Richardson and the other two male students were able to make it back to their car and went to the local police station to report what had happened to them. The officer on duty that night was a nineteen-year-old intern, Joseph D. Cooke, Jr.  To the surprise of many people, he called for back up and searched for Owens. The officer spotted the assailant's car and a chase ensued. Eventually, the men pulled their car over and the muffled screams of Owens could be heard from the car.

Hogg was in a television production class when the shooting started; the fire alarm was activated and she believed it was possibly a prank because they had had a fire alarm drill earlier in the day.[7] When Hogg and other students were in the stairwell after evacuating due to the alarm, she realized that it was not a prank after she saw students running out of the building.[7] She went back to her classroom and unlocked a closet in the room and hid with other students.[8] Hogg reunited with her brother and father later that day.[9] Her friends Jaime Guttenburg,   Alaina Petty,   Alyssa Alhadeff, and Gina Montalto were killed in the shooting.[4]\n",

Five agents were struck, two of them fatally, prompting a massive law enforcement response, including the SWAT team from the Broward County Sheriff's Office. One of the fatally wounded agents, Daniel Alfin, managed to return fire, despite being shot multiple times.

Local businesses intended to draw tourist money by offering Miami as a more modern alternative to Havana. To cater to tourists, many local businesses expected a relaxed approach from the vice police to gambling, and more acceptance of foreigners. Some grew frustrated with Miami's new tourism-based economy and began an anti-vice crusade. These included  construction workers affected by business failings in the area. This crusade began during Prohibition and led to the revitalization of the Ku Klux Klan in the Miami area.[2]\nLa Paloma nightclub's performance offerings included early drag queens known as \"female impersonators\" singing and telling jokes, women stripping. It was generally understood to cater specifically to LGBT patrons. Many locals called it indecent. Club owner Al Youst had already been arrested six times, but to many residents it seemed that the arrests would not shut the club down.[2]\n",

McGirth told her he had heard of her recent accident and sympathized with her. He told her he felt bad for her situation and had a gift for her, resulting in Sheila giving him directions to the family home. After giving McGirth directions, he and two accomplices, Theodore Houston and Jarrord Marqui Roberts arrived at the house. Within minutes of their arrival, Sheila wheeled herself into her room to smoke a cigarette. McGirth and Houston followed her, then tied her hands, head, and mouth with duct tape. Sheila then watched McGirth shoot Diana Miller, in the chest in her bedroom. Diana fell onto the bed and began coughing up blood. Despite this, Diana insisted she was fine and told Sheila everything would be alright. Afterward, Sheila was abducted by the trio and taken to the Millers' family van.[4] McGirth then returned to the house and shot both Diana and her husband James in the back of the head.

She was assassinated while preaching in Miami, Florida.\nLaura Adorkor Kofi (surname variously spelled as Kofy, Koffey or Kofey) was born near Accra, Ghana, possibly into a royal family. A plaque at her gravesite gives the title \"Princess\", and 1893 as a birthdate; other sources put her birthdate much earlier.[1] Some versions of her early life also say that she experienced visions and voices which encouraged her to go abroad and teach Africans in America.[2] Her detractors in her last years spread rumors that she was born \"Laura Champion\" in Athens, Georgia; but religious history scholar Richard S. Newman compiled evidence to confirm that she was, in fact, Ghanaian by birth.[3]\nKofi moved to North America around 1918, and lived in Detroit for several years. She worked as national field director for Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, touring the deep South and attracting large crowds[4] as a \"prophet\" (in her own estimation), with her base in Jacksonville, Florida.[5] In 1927 she founded the African Universal Church, with herself as its head (\"Warrior Mother of Africa's Warriors of the Most High God\" was her self-chosen title).[1] Garvey soon decided that she was building too much of a following independent of his cause, and announced, \"This woman is a fake and has no authority from me to speak.\"[6] He also encouraged his followers to have her arrested for fraud.[7]\n",

After word of the attack spread, and Mary Sherman claimed her attackers were \"two negroes,\" a citywide search ensued.[1] Suspicions immediately led to John Evans. Two days after the murder, a posse consisting of some of the city's most prominent and well-respected members stormed the St. Petersburg jail, threw a noose around Evans' neck and marched him to his death.[1] He was never given a fair trial.[2] Evans was hanged from a light post on the corner of Ninth Street South and Second Avenue. At first, he kept himself alive by wrapping his legs around the light pole. An unidentified white woman in a nearby automobile ended his struggle with a single bullet. Though the shot was fatal, the rest of the crowd began shooting at Evans' dangling body until their ammunition was depleted.[1][3]\nBetween 1882 and 1968, 4,743 people were reportedly lynched in the United States, 3,446 of whom were black. In 1914, the Tuskegee Institute reported that 51 of 55 lynching victims were black.[1] That same year the Crisis, a NAACP magazine, reported that 69 of 74 victims were black. In Florida, mobs lynched five victims. They were all black.[1] South Florida led the nation in lynchings per capita from 1900 to 1930.[4][5]\n",

His father, William Sr., Guilherme Medeiros Silva was a crewman on a New Bedford whaling ship from 1853 until his death in 1871.  (The Portuguese word \"silva\" translates into English as \"wood\" or \"forest\".)  William Jr. was only 12 years old when his father died, and had to drop out of school and find a job to provide for his mother and younger siblings. Fortunately for William Wood, Andrew G. Pierce, a wealthy New Bedford textile manufacturer, offered him a job working in his Wamsutta Cotton Mill.  Pierce would soon see that hiring young William would prove to be extremely beneficial.  Pierce was impressed with Wood's work and promoted him to the manufacturing department, where he learned cost structures and figures. At the age of eighteen, Wood left New Bedford for Philadelphia.  With the help of Andrew Pierce, William was able to find a good job with a Philadelphia brokerage firm.  This is where he learned about stocks and bonds.  After tiring of Philadelphia, he returned to New Bedford and worked at a bank.  According to the Dukes County Intelligencer, when a Fall River textile company went bankrupt, its new manager hired William as paymaster. Then in 1885, the Washington Mill in Lawrence went bankrupt and was purchased by Frederick Ayer of Lowell. Frederick Ayer and his brother James Cook Ayer were successful patent medicine producers.[2]\n",

At least six black people and two white people were killed, but eyewitness accounts suggested a higher death toll of 27 to 150. The town of Rosewood was destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black men in the years before the massacre,[2] including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.[citation needed]\nBefore the massacre, the town of Rosewood had been a quiet, primarily black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been assaulted by a black drifter. A mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. For several days, survivors from the town hid in nearby swamps until they were evacuated to larger towns by train and car. No arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black and white residents; none of them ever moved back, none of them were ever compensated for the loss of their land, and the town ceased to exist.\nAlthough the rioting was widely reported around the United States at the time, few official records documented the event. The survivors, their descendants, and the perpetrators all remained silent about Rosewood for decades. Sixty years after the rioting, the story of Rosewood was revived by major media outlets when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s. The survivors and their descendants all organized in an attempt to sue the state for failing to protect Rosewood's black community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned a report on the incident. As a result of the findings, Florida compensated the survivors and their descendants for the damages which they had incurred because of racial violence. The incident was the subject of a 1997 feature film which was directed by John Singleton. In 2004, the state designated the site of Rosewood as a Florida Heritage Landmark.\n",

He was executed by lethal injection. In the days before his execution, there were a large number of appeals for clemency, ranging from petitions to pleas, as well as a request to halt the execution from Pope Benedict XVI.[1] Grossman, a Jewish American, received strong support from national and international Jewish organizations for his death sentence to be commuted.[2][3][4]\nGrossman, an only child, grew up having to care for his mentally and physically ill father and uncle, a full-time responsibility which led to his dropping out of the ninth grade. His father died when he was 15 years old, followed shortly by his uncle, grandfather and other relatives. Grossman experienced severe depression and used alcohol and a variety of narcotics such as marijuana and PCP. He also took prescription drugs, including  Valium and barbiturates, readily available in his mother's medicine cabinet. He was also well known as a very skilled driver.[5]\nOn December 13, 1984, Margaret \"Peggy\" Park, a 26-year-old wildlife officer, came across Grossman (then aged 19) and Thayne Taylor (aged 17) shooting a stolen handgun in a wooded area of Pinellas County, Florida. Grossman, who was on probation for grand theft and other charges after burglarizing a former girlfriend's house, asked her not to turn him in for possessing a weapon and being outside Pasco County. Both were violations of his probation.[6]\n",

Initially, it was said he left his home in Tallahassee, Florida, United States, to go duck hunting. After subsequent investigations, he was presumed to have drowned in Lake Seminole, a large reservoir located in the southwest corner of Georgia along its border with Florida; investigators later came to suspect he had been the victim of foul play, possibly at another location.[3] His body was found in October 2017 near Tallahassee,[4] and Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) officials confirmed Williams was a victim of homicide.[5]\nAfter Williams's boat was found abandoned on the lake, the initial theory was that he had fallen out of it after a collision. However, a lengthy and exhaustive search of the lake bed in the area failed to find his body: at that time, it was the only known occasion when no remains or body had been discovered after a drowning death in the lake.[6] It was eventually concluded that his body had been eaten by alligators. After waders and a jacket containing Williams's hunting license were found in the lake six months later, he was declared legally dead, following a court petition by his widow, Denise. She went on to marry Brian Winchester, a mutual friend who had helped her take out a large life insurance policy on Williams shortly before his disappearance.\n",

Convicted for two of the killings and sentenced to death, he and another inmate were stabbed to death during a dispute in prison.[1]\nEdwin Bernard Kaprat III was born on September 21, 1964, in New York City, New York, one of two children born to refrigeration mechanic Edwin \"Skip\" Kaprat Jr. and his wife Ruth, a real estate agent. The family moved to the Great Meadows section of Independence Township, New Jersey when he was still young, and according to neighbors, they were considered to be upstanding citizens.[2] Although described as intelligent and obsessed with reading books, Kaprat, who was nicknamed \"Mike\" by family members, was also known to be a very violent and easily-angered bully who would attack those weaker and smaller than him. Due to this, his teachers resorted to giving him plush toys so he could redirect his anger to them, punching and kicking them.[2] He reportedly started drinking at age 12 and developed an addiction to alcohol, which landed him in juvenile treatment centers and juvenile courts on numerous occasions.\nAfter his 16th birthday, Kaprat dropped out of the Hackettstown High School, and in November 1982, he married his pregnant girlfriend, Nora Niederhaus.[3] Even after the birth of his two sons, Kaprat continued drinking and smoked marijuana. By that time, the Kaprat family had faced some strife, as the elder Kaprats divorced and their daughter, Ruthie, experienced marital problems with one of her husbands having threatened to torch her car.[3] Despite his hot temper, Kaprat was well-liked by his family and relatives, and was noted for his interest in the Middle Ages and Dungeons & Dragons.[4] In October 1990, he and his wife moved to his parents' home in Spring Hill, Florida, where they had planned to start a new life with their children.[3]\n",

As a boy, he often served as guide to visiting fishermen and plume hunters, although he later denounced poaching after legislation was passed to protect the dwindling number of birds.  In 1902, Bradley was hired by the American Ornithologists' Union, at the request of the Florida Audubon Society, to become one of the country's first game wardens.\nTasked with protecting the area's wading birds from hunters, he patrolled the area stretching from Florida's west coast, through the Everglades, to Key West, single-handedly enforcing the ban on bird hunting.[1]  Bradley was shot and killed in the line of duty, after confronting a man and his two sons who were hunting egrets in the Everglades.  His much-publicized death at the age of 35 galvanized conservationists and served as inspiration for future legislation to protect Florida's bird populations.  Several national awards and places have been named in his honor.\nGuy Bradley was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1870. His family had strong ties to the city; his father, Edwin Ruthven Bradley, was born there in 1840, and two members of the family held high positions in Chicago's law enforcement.[2]  Six years after Guy's birth, the family relocated to Florida.  After making their home in smaller towns, the family eventually settled in Fort Lauderdale, where Edwin became keeper of the Fort Lauderdale House of Refuge.  Shortly after the death of Bradley's sister Flora from an unknown illness\u2014which also affected Guy, leaving him ill for several years\u2014the family moved to the vicinity of Lake Worth.[3] Edwin became a postman, earning an annual wage of six hundred dollars.

Four men broke into the home and bludgeoned six victims to death. The four attackers,[2] apparently inspired by the film Wonderland,[3] tortured and killed four men, two women, and a dog inside the home, making it the bloodiest mass murder in Volusia County history.[4] Their primary motive for the murders was revenge on Erin Belanger, who had evicted a squatter, Troy Victorino, from her grandmother's then-vacant house, with the secondary motive of recovering an Xbox game console and some clothing that Victorino had left behind. Victorino was able to further motivate his accomplices by pointing out that the attack would likely allow them to kill another person they were mad at, but that person happened not to be at the house that night.[5]\nA jury found Troy Victorino, Robert Cannon, Jerone Hunter, and Michael Salas guilty of the massacre in August 2006. Seventh Circuit Judge William A. Parsons upheld the jury's death penalty recommendation and called the killings \"conscienceless\" and \"unnecessarily torturous.\"[6] He told each of the men during back-to-back sentencing hearings, \"You have not only forfeited your right to live among us, you have forfeited your right to live at all.\" Salas and Cannon were both sentenced to life in prison, while Hunter and Victorino received the death sentence. The death sentences of Victorino and Hunter were overturned on June 14, 2017.[7] Prosecutors intend to seek death sentences for the two men again and both Victorino and Hunter are awaiting resentencing.[8][9][10]\nVictorino and Hunter were among a group squatting on Belanger's grandparents' property while they were away.[11] The group was using the property as a party house. Belanger, who had moved to Florida to look after her grandparents' home, had deputies evict the squatters and boxed up belongings left behind.[11]\n",

Growing up in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Brandt shot his parents in their family home on the night of January 3, 1971, when he was 13, killing his pregnant mother and wounding his father. He spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released and was never criminally charged. 33 years later, on September 13, 2004, Brandt stabbed his wife and niece to death and then hanged himself in his niece's garage. This incident, Brandt's efficiency in killing his wife and niece, and his hidden obsession with human anatomy led investigators to look into the possibility that he had committed other murders since moving to Florida in 1973. The 1989 murder of a homeless woman near Brandt's home was solved as a result of the investigation, as Brandt was found to have been the perpetrator. The police suspect him in three other Florida murders, but his true number of victims could potentially be more than 30.\nCharlie Brandt was the second child of Herbert and Ilsa Brandt, two German immigrants who originally settled in Texas before moving to Connecticut. Brandt's father worked as a laborer for a division of International Harvester, eventually working his way up to draftsman and project engineer. The family moved frequently and as a result Brandt and his older sister Angela attended several different schools.[2]\nBrandt was regarded as a good student, but was shy and had difficulty adjusting to new surroundings. In September 1968, Herbert was transferred to International Harvester's plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The family frequently vacationed in Florida, where Brandt hunted small game with his father.[2]\n",

Circumstantial evidence was collected against him, but nothing directly linked him to the crime.

They tied his body to the back of their truck and dragged his corpse to the Cannady farm, where a white crowd estimated at 2,000 attacked the corpse by stabbing it with sticks and knives.[2] Later that night Neal's body was hanged from a tree in the courthouse square. When the sheriff discovered it in the morning, he cut it down.[3][5]\nA large group of white people went to the courthouse in Marianna, demanding that the body be hanged again so they could see it.

Lewis, made a 911 call stating that she had found her daughter in the family's pool and she was not breathing.[2] Emergency personnel rushed Adrianna to the nearby hospital Bay Medical,[3] where she was pronounced dead about an hour after arrival. The death was initially treated as an accident until Adrianna's half-brother A.J., then 6 years old, told police that he had witnessed his mother \"dunk\" Adrianna in the pool as a form of corporal punishment.[4]\nDuring the investigation, police discovered that Adrianna had been diagnosed with ADHD and Lewis stated that while she initially had trouble bonding with her daughter, her affection for Adrianna had grown over time.[4] Investigators also found that neither Adrianna nor A.J. appeared to have any toys in the house, to which Lewis stated that the toys had been taken away for a week as a form of punishment and that the toys were stored in a shed. After searching the shed, investigators noted that there were no toys in the shed or any evidence to suggest that they had been there. There was a little red wagon and two inflatable toys for the pool in the yard but no other toys.[4] Dr. Renee Fox, the emergency room physician who had handled Adrianna's medical care, informed investigators that Lewis had not shown any emotion or reaction when informed that her daughter had died, which she had found odd.[3] Lewis submitted to and passed a lie detector test where she claimed that she had not killed her daughter.[5][4] In September 2007, Lewis was arrested and charged with the first-degree murder of Adrianna.[6] She was offered a plea bargain that would have required her to plead guilty to manslaughter and receive a ten-year sentence, which she declined in favor of going to trial.\nLewis went to trial in February 2008,[7] where the statements by A.J. and Dr. Fox were brought up as evidence and the defense argued that A.J. was not a reliable witness, as his story had changed several times during further questioning.[8] Other evidence brought to trial included an autopsy performed by Dr. Charles Siebert, statements from Lewis's co-workers, evidence of poor housekeeping, and the lack of toys, including Lewis's statement over the toys' whereabouts.[9] The prosecution also pointed out multiple bruises on Adrianna's forehead that correlated with A.J.'s testimony.[4] Four days after the case went to trial and after only two hours (including lunch) of deliberation, the jury found Lewis guilty of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.[10] In March of the same year, Lewis was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[8]\n",

The murder has been alleged to be in connection with the sale of his company, SunCruz Casinos.[1]\nBoulis was born in Kavala, a city in northern Greece. During his childhood, he was known as \"Kostas\". Each day after finishing school, he would run to the shore to wait for his father's boat. His father was a fisherman, and he was the third of four children. Boulis wanted to move away from his home country as he found it difficult to deal with the death of his brother Panagiotis \"Peter\" Boulis, who was fatally electrocuted in an accident. He took classes in ship mechanics at age 16, to prepare himself with skills necessary for a future in the United States. In July 1971, while at a dry-cleaning store, he met the sixteen year old receptionist Efrosini \"Frances\" Boulis, who also originated from Kavala. The day that they met, Boulis was detained as an illegal migrant. One week later, they were married. Their marriage automatically granted Boulis a Canadian citizenship. Within the space of four years from their marriage, they had raised two sons; Christos and Panagiotis.[2] Frances stayed in Greece raising their two sons while Boulis developed his multiple businesses and holding companies in North America.[2] Within days of arriving in Florida, Gus Boulis had met Margaret Hren, an 18-year-old employee originating from Minnesota. Hren agreed to assist Boulis in launching a restaurant business after obtaining a $50,000 loan from a Canadian bank. The couple renovated a dilapidated restaurant in Key West. Two years later, Boulis constructed his first hotel, the \"Marriott Key Largo Beach Resort\" obtaining the startup funds from a $2.5 million overdraft from a local bank.[3] Eventually Boulis and Hren had two sons. Frances remained in Greece and filed for a divorce and half of his assets.[4] Boulis was known for being a tireless hard worker who did whatever it takes to drive his many businesses to success and perfection. He usually wore polo or dress shirts, jeans, or tuxedos. Boulis enjoyed soccer, supporting the Olympiacos FC fanatically, and travelling in his private jet to attend their games. He stood at 174\u00a0cm, had blonde hair and blue eyes. Gus Boulis was known by the local Greek community as a generous and caring person, always willing to help out anybody in need with loans or business ventures.[2] Over 300 people attended his funeral, at the St George Greek Orthodox Church in Hollywood. Attendees were seen crying in the masses, and kissing his face. Many positive speeches and comments about Gus Boulis were made. Mayor Mara Giulianti attended his funeral as well.[5]\nBoulis was born in a fishing village of Kavala in Macedonia. He stayed in school only until the sixth grade to work as a fisherman and then trained as a mechanic.[6] Upon leaving school, he went to work for his father. Boulis joined the merchant marines in 1968 against his father's wishes. He would later jump ship in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, to avoid compulsory military service before moving off to Toronto, Ontario.[7] Boulis started off as a fisherman before taking a job as a dishwasher at a Mr. Submarine sandwich chain. The original owners of Mr. Submarine, now known as Mr. Sub, were Jack Levinson and Earl Linzon. It was Gus Boulis who showed Levinson and Linzon how to franchise. He soon was offered control of one of the stores, and shares in the corporation.[8][9] In his five years with the company Boulis developed a chain of over 200 stores. The sale of the Boulis's shares in the company in the mid-1970s made Boulis a multimillionaire at 25.\n",

The comic became a New York Times bestseller and over US$165,000 was raised by the sales, which was donated to the victims.[1][2] The comic was produced with volunteer work by dozens of artists and featured the first official comic based on the Harry Potter media franchise.[3][4][5]\nUnlike most graphic novels, the book does not contain a cohesive story or several shorter stories spanning several pages but instead a mass anthology[6][7] with one or two-page-long shorts, comic strips or single illustrated pages lacking panels or dialogue bubbles.[8] IDW Publishing simply referred to it as an \"oversize comic\",[9] as did Goodreads,[10] Geek.com,[11] and Comic Book Resources.[12]\n",

He married Ann Fuller Townsend in 1822 while living in Illinois.[3][6]\nCold weather particularly bothered Perrine after his arsenic poisoning, and in 1824 he moved to Natchez, Mississippi (leaving his family in Illinois) in the hope that the climate would aid his recovery. He began studying herbs and medicinal plants while in Natchez. Malaria was common in the Natchez area, and Perrine began studying the use of quinine to treat it. He published the results of his research in the Philadelphia Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences in 1826, and that report remained an important source on the subject for a century. In 1825 Perrine and his family moved to his wife Ann's hometown of Sodus, New York. Believing that he needed to move to a climate even warmer than that of Natchez, Perrine had applied in 1824 for a diplomatic position in a tropical country. In 1827 he sent copies of his report on the use of quinine to Washington. Shortly thereafter he was appointed United States Consul in Campeche, Mexico, where he served for ten years.[3][7]\n",

Her body was then dragged about a mile from her home and dumped in the yard of a house on the 200 block of Northeast 12th Avenue.

However, Kelpien's body was not found until 7:00\u00a0a.m. An autopsy revealed that she had sexual intercourse shortly before her death.[1]\nOn July 25, 1973, a woman, 25, was attacked by the perpetrator in her first-story apartment on the 400 block of Northeast 16th Avenue in Fort Lauderdale. At 9:15\u00a0p.m., the perpetrator wrapped a sock around her neck as she entered her apartment. The woman fought back, kicking and screaming at her attacker. During the struggle, a coffee table had been overturned and the two fell onto the couch. The assailant then fled the scene, likely fearing that the victim's screams would alert others of the attacker.[2] The assailant, described as slim, blonde-haired, white man, had gained entry into the apartment by prying open a window. Before attacking the victim, he rummaged through the victim's purse, which was located in her closet. Due to a gold sock being used in both crimes, police suspected that the attack was connected to the murder of Jonina Kelpien.[2]\n",

The three women had been purchased by Seminoles when they were children. Inheritance in the Seminoles was matrilineal, with a woman's children belonging to her clan. Normally, children with a Seminole father and a black mother would not have belonged to any clan, a distinct disadvantage in Seminole society. The last three African women among the Seminoles were adopted into the clan system. Nagey Nancy was owned by the Snake clan, and her two children by Seminole fathers, Jim Jumper and Nancy, were designated as belonging to the Little Black Snake Clan.[1]\nThe Snake clan, along with other Seminole clans, had lived on Fisheating Creek west of Lake Okeechobee for many years after the Third Seminole War, but in the 1880s a white cattleman bought their herds on the condition that the Seminoles move away. The Snake clan then moved to an area northeast of Lake Okeechobee later called Bluefields.[2][a]\n",

Members were obligated to actively seek jury service in matters involving other members, assist in the escape of members who were incarcerated, and ultimately, murder those individuals opposed by the group.[4] The group was organized by Alfred Bidwell and Dr. Leonard Andrews, who referred to themselves as \"judges,\" while members Jason Alford, \"captain,\" Louis Cato and Charles Willard, \"lieutenants,\" constituted the remaining command structure of the organization.[5]\nNotoriety for the Sarasota Vigilance Committee came with the murders of Charles E. Abbe and Harrison T. Riley.

He was later fatally shot by two witnesses while cycling away from the scene.\nBrown was born on November 26, 1930 in Chicago, Illinois. He joined the U.S. Navy and was honorably discharged in 1954. People later stated that Brown always kept a military bearing about himself and was quite militaristic. In 1955, he moved from Chicago to Florida,[1] where he graduated from the University of Miami in 1957 and in 1964 from East Carolina College in Greenville, North Carolina, earning a master's degree in education. After working briefly for Keyes Realty, he got a full-time job as history teacher at Hialeah Junior High School in 1962[1] and moonlighted at Miami-Dade Community College as an accounting instructor from 1964 to 1970.\nBrown was married twice and had three children. His first wife died and his second marriage failed, according to his second wife, Sylvia, because he refused to seek psychological help. As a consequence, his condition began to deteriorate, resulting in an increasingly disheveled and gaunt appearance, and, though once being a rather gregarious person, he began isolating himself more and more. A neighbor later described him looking \"as if he were 80 years old\". Reportedly, one of his daughters once tried to have him hospitalized, though as his admission had to be voluntary, her request was declined. Additionally, his career began to suffer. At Hialeah Junior High, Brown was an alleged bigot who hated everyone,[2][3] and was transferred to Drew Middle School, a school with a black majority, in 1981. There he taught American history until March 3, 1982, when he was relieved of his teaching duties for medical leave to treat his psychiatric problems.\n",

Dade was killed in a battle with Seminole Indians that came to be known as the \"Dade Massacre\".\nDade was born in Virginia, most likely in King George County.[1] He joined the Twelfth Infantry in March 1813 (during the War of 1812) as a third lieutenant. He was transferred to the Fourth Infantry in May 1815.[2] Under this post, he successfully led two military expeditions, in 1825 and 1826, from Fort Brooke in Tampa to Fort King near Ocala, through an area that was wilderness at the time and in the midst of ongoing conflict with Native Americans. He also commanded the United States Army base at Key West, and was eventually assigned to command the southern portion of Florida, running from Cape Florida on the Atlantic coast to Charlotte Harbor on the Gulf coast.[3] He was brevetted major in February 1828 after ten years of service as a captain.[2] By late 1835, he commanded a unit of 47 men, half of whom were European immigrants.[3] Dade was stationed in Key West until October of 1835, when violence broke out in the Second Seminole War. General Duncan Lamont Clinch ordered Dade to leave one noncommissioned officer and 3 privates in Key West before taking the rest of his men to Fort Brooke.[4]\nDade's final mission was to lead 110 men from Fort Brooke to Fort King. The Seminoles, led by Osceola and Micanopy, destroyed bridges over the Hillsborough River and Withlacoochee River in order to delay the progress of the command, and ambushed the men on December 28, killing Dade and most of his men, and leaving only two survivors. The attack was followed in 1836 by widespread attacks on white settlers in Florida, and then by a US military buildup under General Winfield Scott. Dade and his men were not formally buried until a unit led by Edmund P. Gaines arrived at the site of the massacre in February 1836, Dade's remains only being identifiable by his vest and infantry buttons.[3]\n",

He was an Orange County correctional officer for a few months in 1978, but was fired for falling asleep at work. Some years prior to his crime spree, he moved into a modest concrete house in Pine Hills, where he lived with his common law wife, two sons and two German shepherds.[4]\nDescribed by his neighbors as an unfriendly and rather quiet person, Cox was seen as a nice old man by family and relatives, who enjoyed talking to younger people and tinkering with his ham radio at home.[5] Due to a back injury he sustained in 1996, he was discharged from the army reserve and had to walk using a cane, but still managed to earn a living from his job as a telemarketer.[4]\n",

During that period, he was placed on the Terrorist Screening Database, but was subsequently removed.[4] In a call to 9-1-1 during the shooting, Mateen identified himself as \"Mujahideen\", \"Islamic Soldier\", and \"Soldier of God\";[5][6] and pledged his allegiance multiple times to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who at the time was the leader of the militant jihadist group ISIL.[7] He said the shooting was \"triggered\" by an airstrike in Iraq that killed Abu Wahib, an ISIL commander, six weeks before.[8]\n",

He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center and soon started his music career on SoundCloud in 2013, employing styles and techniques that were unconventional in rap music such as distortion and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals, drawing inspiration from third-wave emo and grunge. In 2014, he formed the underground collective Members Only and alongside other members of the collective soon became a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap music scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s.[18] XXXTentacion gained mainstream attention with the single \"Look at Me\".

Backus had been encouraging several young African American artists and persuading them to paint landscapes rather than religious motifs.[6] In 1956, when Hair was 14 years old, he began taking painting lessons from Backus. After three years, Hair set out on his own to earn a living as an artist. Because of Jim Crow era racism, art galleries in Florida would not represent African American artists, forcing Hair to find other m\nethods of selling his artwork.

The Lindbergh case inspired Congress to pass legislation that allowed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate kidnappings in any state under certain conditions, one of which was a ransom demand.[3] Despite this legislation, ransom kidnappings continued to be a major concern at the time when James Bailey Cash Jr. was abducted in May 1938.[4]\n",

Although his father ignored him, Francisco's happiest memories involved going to the beach with his mother.[1]\nAt age 16, Del Junco began hearing voices and started seeing priestesses conducting black magic, gradually distancing himself from people as he feared somebody was out to kill him. In 1980, he moved to Miami to settle in with some relatives, arriving through the Mariel boatlift. During his time in the States, Del Junco worked several jobs, regularly visited his psychiatrist and was admitted to the Miami Mental Health Clinic a total of three times (in 1987, 1988 and 1992).[1]\n",

After he was sentenced to death in three separate trials, Henry was executed for the latter murders at the Florida State Prison in 2014.[1]\nIn August 1975, Henry, his 28-year-old common law wife Patricia Roddy, and her two daughters, two and three at the time, were driving around in Dade City. During an argument, Henry stopped the car in a parking lot and stabbed Roddy to death.[2] After the killing, he fled towards a wooded area in Zephyrhills, where he was tracked down and arrested by a sheriff's deputy named Fay Wilber. Medical examiner Joan Wood testified that Roddy had been stabbed around 30 times, mostly in the neck and upper body.[2] Henry pleaded no contest to second degree murder and received a 15-year prison sentence with a chance of parole.[2][3]\nIn January 1983, Henry was paroled after serving 7-and-a-half years of his murder conviction. After his release, he married 28-year-old convenience store clerk Suzanne Overstreet, a divorced Zephyrhills woman with a 4-year-old son named Eugene \"Buggy\" Christian. The couple's marriage proved unstable, as both of them were arrested on multiple occasions for possessing and selling drugs. Henry had numerous convictions for firearms offenses.[4] By August 1984, Suzanne had gone to a women's shelter, citing her fear that her husband would harm both her and her son, and reportedly sought to have a restraining order issued against him.[5] On December 22, 1985, Henry went to her apartment to ask whether he could buy any Christmas gifts for Christian. Suzanne allowed him inside, but then the pair began to argue.[6] Henry later said that the two fought over a knife before he stabbed Suzanne 13 times.[7] While she lay dying on the ground, Henry supposedly sat down and watched while smoking a cigarette.[8] After wrapping her body in a rug, Henry stole a car and took Christian to a pasture near Thonotosassa, where he stabbed him to death behind a chicken farm.[4]\n",

His unit often came under fire while it was building railways and bridges. During fierce fighting, his unit was pushed back against a river, he was part of a group of volunteers that swam across the river with a rope so the other members of his unit could cross it. He left Europe on April 1, 1919, on the USS Martha Washington and he was honorably discharged later that same year.[1]\nDuring Prohibition, Cabeza illegally operated the Red Rooster, a bar, a coffee shop and a sporting club. It was located on Thomas Street near the waterfront. While he was operating the Red Rooster, he openly lived with a black woman who was named Angela. This interracial relationship did not sit well in the Jim Crow South, and his dealing in liquor put him outside the law.

        "paragraph": "The Shauna Taylor Case was a 2018 criminal trial involving the investigation and conviction of Shauna Dee Taylor, a Floridian housewife who had poisoned her prematurely-born infant daughter (unnamed in public sources) with Tylenol iron supplements, causing acute liver damage due to iron poisoning, from which the child unexpectedly survived.[1][2][3] The case rose to further prominence in 2019 when two of Shauna's then-grown adult children, Annie and Joshua Taylor, appeared publicly on the daytime talk show Dr. Phil, reporting that all 10 children documented as being under Shauna's care at one point or another, including themselves, had been subjected to severe physical, verbal and medical abuse.[4] Shauna was diagnosed with Munchausen by proxy and convicted to 12 years in prison for aggravated child abuse, with 15 months of parole to follow.[5]\nShauna and her husband Bill Taylor lived in various US states in the time in which they had their children, having amassed a family of 10 children, later having several of these children removed from their care due to allegations of abuse in California and Arizona.[6] Bill claimed to have no knowledge of Shauna's abuse of the children, arguing that he was absent from the family most of the time for work-related reasons. He divorced Shauna after the poisoning of their infant daughter. \"The time that these poisonings occurred, I had been out of the home already for six months and I was working six days a week, 10 hours a day,\" Bill said in 2019. \"On the several visits to the emergency room, I was scratching my head thinking, my gosh. How could all my kids have such severe medical issues?\"[7]\nIt is unclear to what extent Shauna abused the children under her care. Annie Taylor alleged on Dr. Phil that she had been given unprescribed insulin in glasses of milk by Shauna when she was a child, with no medical advice from a doctor or nurse. Annie had also had two spinal taps, seemingly for no apparent recorded medical reason. Josh Taylor reported children, including himself, being put in dog cages as a form of humiliation while Shauna shouted profanities at them, being force-fed milk and money (metal coins that he would be made to swallow whole), and forcibly drugged with various over the counter and prescription medications. Shauna reportedly had an obsessive fixation on injuring the livers of her children and would damage their internal organs with repeated drugging and beatings. Annie and Josh reported that they continued to suffer the effects of this abuse into adulthood.[8][9] These allegations made on Dr. Phil were later verified by ABC News, which revealed that Shauna's parental rights to the children had long-since been terminated.[10]\n",

In 2021, Morris appealed and instead of retrying the case, State Attorney Andrew Warren elected to agree to re-sentencing Morris to life in prison on that case.[3] Morris is also sentence to life in prison for the murder of Rodney Jones.[4]\nDontae Morris was born the son of a 16-year-old who suffered from depression. His father was murdered when he was two years old, and the crime remains unsolved. He grew up partially with his sick grandmother and changed schools several times.

During the gun battle which ensued, Platt in particular was able to repeatedly return fire despite sustaining multiple hits. Two Special Agents died from their wounds, while five other agents were injured by gunfire. The shootout ended when both Matix and Platt were killed.\nThe incident is infamous as one of the most violent episodes in the history of the FBI and is often studied in law enforcement training.

Asay's execution generated attention as it was noted by multiple news agencies that he was the first white person to be executed in Florida for killing a black person.[3][4] He was also the first person to be executed in the United States using the drug etomidate.[5]\nOn July 17, 1987, Asay, his brother Robbie, and friend Bubba, visited multiple bars in Jacksonville, Florida, where they drank beer and played pool. After leaving a bar in the early hours of July 18, the three men decided to head downtown to find some prostitutes. Once there, Robbie began speaking with another man, 34-year-old Robert Lee Booker, who was black. Asay grew angry and started shouting racial slurs at Booker.

Her legs, feet, and neck all had serious bruises; an example of the amount of force used on her was similar to bruises from that of a speeding car.[4] Her other injuries included a fractured skull, fractured rib, and swollen brain.

Powell further explained that her unfortunate childhood \"sounds like a banal excuse, but that explains why some of these crimes happen, because parents do not recognize or ignore the emotional needs of their children, and when these needs are not met, this is another example of what can happen.\"\n",

His grandfather, Josiah Belden, was an early California pioneer who made millions in San Francisco real estate and was the first Mayor of San Jose. After graduating from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Charles Belden bought his first camera to record a European tour with his school friend, Eugene Phelps.[2] The highlight of the tour was a journey through Russia in Belden's 1908 Packard, the first automobile to make such a trip in the country. After the trip, Belden went to work as a cowboy on the Phelps (Pitchfork) Ranch in Wyoming.[1] In 1912, Belden married Eugene's sister, Frances. The couple had three children, Annice, Margot, and Mary Elizabeth, who died while still a toddler. Eugene's father died in 1922, leaving Eugene and Charles to take over management of the Pitchfork Ranch. Belden's 1921\u20131940 photographs of the Pitchfork Ranch were widely published, including in The Saturday Evening Post, National Geographic, and on the cover of Life magazine.[3]\nAirplanes became a fascination for Belden. In the late 1920s, Charles became involved in raising antelope and sending them by airplane to zoos around the world, including some to Germany in the Hindenburg.[4] He helped to pioneer the process of planting fish from the air and filmed the experience for future reference. In addition, he helped the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission conduct a census of wildlife herd populations using aerial photographs.\n",

It was not until his murder conviction that he met his real mother.[8] In 1965, when Henry was 15 years old, he stabbed a 19-year-old man in Orlando's west side. He claimed the man was trying to rob him, but nevertheless Henry was forced to be housed at a boy's reformatory in Marianna, Florida, for a few months.[8]\nHenry was re-arrested in 1970, at age 20, for shooting and critically wounding a man. Once again Henry claimed it was self-defense, but the man said Henry tried to rob him. In jail, he was accused of attacking a jail supervisor.[8] In 1973, Henry took part in a prison fight, during which he suffered a knife wound to his left eye, causing him to permanently lose sight in that eye. Later that year Henry was released from prison.[8]\n",

Williams, Cellos Harrison, Willie James Howard, and Jesse James Payne.[1] Hobbs argues World War II shifted public opinion and behavior in the United States, leading to private mob violence against African Americans instead of public lynchings, and to what Hobbs describes as \"legal lynchings.\"[1]\nIn a review for The Journal of American History, W. Fitzhugh Brundage writes \"Tameka Bradley Hobbs makes a convincing argument that these lynchings reveal important insights into the evolution of white supremacy in twentieth-century America.\"[2] In a review for the Journal of Southern History, Mari N.

With so much of the literature on lynching focused on white southerners, her interviews with African American survivors provide a poignant and, at times, gut-wrenching glimpse into the intergenerational trauma of lynching.\"[1]\n",

When Ruth had found Ferrell and Anderson in the home moments later, Ferrell bludgeoned her to death, bashing her head with the crowbar.

Hilliard is reported to have had \"no shortage of men in her past\", including an ex-husband, Benjamin Levins. Manuel immediately arrested.

Multiple suspects were questioned, but no charges were filed. This led investigators to review the Hilliard case, and they discovered the witnesses who identified Manuel as the attacker were incredible, but evidence to clear him of suspicion in the case was elusive.[1]\n",

The riot highlighted the racial divide that existed in the United States and the discrimination they faced as soldiers.\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Congress, in its reorganization of the U.S. military, mandated that two of the six cavalry regiments and four of its forty-five infantry regiments be made of African Americans. This was how the Ninth and Tenth U.S. Cavalry and the Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth, and Forty-first Infantry came into being.[2] In 1869 however, the four African American infantry regiments were reorganized into the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Infantry regiments, the same two regiments that would be at the center of the Tampa Riot. From the outsets, the soldiers in these regiments were ostracized from the regular army with many white officers refusing to serve with African American soldiers.[3] This refusal came in part due to the racist perception that African Americans did not make good soldiers. This notion would be disproved on the battlefield, and even as fresh recruits, the soldiers in these regiments gained a reputation for coolness under fire and an indomitable fighting spirit.[4] For the next two decades, these regiments found themselves at the forefront of numerous conflicts against Native Americans, and their fighting prowess earned them the respect of not only Native Americans but also among white soldiers. The Army and Navy Journal even declared that the comradery between white and black soldiers signaled an end to prejudice against blacks in the regular army.[5] When war broke out between Spain and the United States, the Buffalo Soldiers \"were among the first units dispatched to southern camps in preparation for the invasion of Cuba.\"[6]\nThe four units that arrived in Tampa were confronted with the discrimination of the Jim Crow South. The Tampa press was especially critical of the black soldiers, and frequently published stories painting them as undisciplined and riotous. The Tampa Daily Tribune revealed the true reason the citizens of Tampa resented the black soldiers, stating: \"The men insist upon being treated as white men are treated and the citizens will not make any distinction between the colored troops and the colored civilians.\"[7] For these soldiers who had fought with distinction on the frontier, they were appalled by the Tampa resident's efforts to demonize them and resisted efforts by the residents to enforce the practice of segregation practices that had arisen in the South.[8] Resentment toward the black soldiers was not limited to civilians. White soldiers expressed regular vitriol about the ability of black soldiers to exercise authority over them and lunged numerous racial epithets at them.[9] Through the summer of 1898, the black soldiers displayed restraint against those who insulted them, but it was clear that tensions were rising.\n",

Hoffman faced a possible prison sentence if charged and convicted on criminal charges related to the discovered drugs. Police attempted to persuade her to identify other marijuana dealers to avoid the charges. She refused.  The police then pressured her to act as a confidential informant in a drug sting operation instead in exchange for not being charged with additional drug charges. The purported goal of the operation was to buy 1,500 ecstasy pills, 2 oz. of cocaine, and two handguns, which was contrary to department policy, using $13,000 cash in a buy\u2013bust operation.

Barker was the youngest son of Ma Barker, all of whose children were criminals. He was killed in a lengthy gunfight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1935.\nFred Barker was born to George Elias and Arizona Donnie Clark \"Ma\" Barker in Aurora, Missouri on December 12, 1901. The family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1912. Barker's older brothers Herman, Lloyd and Arthur were committing crimes throughout his childhood, belonging to a gang of local delinquent youths called the Central Park Gang. The gang met in the park to plan crimes and stash their stolen goods. There, Barker met future members of the Barker-Karpis gang, including Volney Davis. He was first arrested and imprisoned in 1927 for burglary. While in prison he met Alvin Karpis. According to Karpis, Barker was a dominant figure in jail who was able to obtain marijuana and other perks. Karpis also said he was a \"natural born killer\" who \"never hesitated\".[1] Unlike Karpis (nicknamed \"Creepy Karpis\"), Barker was known for his personal charm. He was released in 1930.\nAfter their release, Barker and Karpis joined up to commit a string of burglaries in Kansas, often collaborating with other local criminals. Several notable gangsters joined the Barkers in various crimes, including Harvey Bailey, Frank Nash, Fred Goetz, and Dr. Joseph Moran. They were accompanied by Ma Barker and her boyfriend, Arthur Dunlop (sometimes called Dunlap). \n",

Coffey was found unresponsive on a couch the morning after the event, and his death became part of a national wave of criticism of fraternity hazing practices. Members of the fraternity were eventually prosecuted for their role in Andrew Coffey's death, with three former fraternity leaders awaiting trial as of December 2018[needs update].\nAndrew Coffey, a junior who transferred to FSU to study civil engineering, was a prospective member of Pi Kappa Phi\u2014commonly referred to as a pledge. On November 2, the fraternity was hosting \"Big Brother Night\" at an off-campus house. Big Brother Night was intended to celebrate pledges becoming mentored by their sponsors, and it was typically a night of heavy drinking for the fraternity. At the time, the fraternity was under a liquor ban, but fraternity members told pledges that the liquor ban was lifted specifically for Big Brother Night.[1][2] The fraternity's Executive Council arranged for rideshare vehicles to take fraternity members and pledges from the fraternity house to an off-campus location. The arrangement was meant to circumvent university policies and national chapter policies regarding alcohol.[citation needed]\nAt some point during the party, Coffey was given a bottle of Wild Turkey bourbon and was coerced into drinking it all in a tradition known as \"the family bottle.\"[3][4][2] Court records said that while pledges were not physically forced into drinking, \"it is clear the environment created by the leaders and fraternity members led to an expectation of abusive drinking or the pledges would face ostracism by the group.\"[2] He drank enough that he passed out.[1][4]\n",

Only two of the eight survived. At the time, the incident was the largest case of mass murder in Miami-Dade County history. Months after the massacre, Ferguson murdered a teenage couple in Hialeah after raping the female victim. He is also suspected to be responsible for the May 1977 murders of an elderly couple and is suspected of killing a further two men in 1974.[3]\nFerguson, Francois, and White were all eventually captured, sentenced to death, and executed by the state of Florida. Francois was executed in the electric chair on May 29, 1985, followed by White, who was executed in the electric chair on August 28, 1987. Ferguson was executed over two decades later by lethal injection on August 5, 2013, following years of appeals over his sanity.[4][5]\n",

In the process, Hayter stabbed Martin with his pitchfork, killing him on the spot. Little information was released about the killing and the motive behind it, but Hayter was convicted and sentenced to a life term with the possibility of parole.[2]\n",

Aside from his political radio commentary, Dor was both on the board of directors and worked as a paralegal at the Haitian Refugee Center, in addition to his involvement in multiple community education programs.

It was alleged that Alexander, born ca. 1970, was contracted to kill d'Or for his opposition to Louis Thermitus, a local record store owner, who d'Or had accused of being a member of the Tonton Macoute and of supporting the regime that had ousted Haiti's elected President Aristide. At the time of his arraignment and later his conviction for the murder of d'Or and Jean-Claude Olivier, another radio journalist, Alexander was serving a life sentence for killing Alcee Lissitte during an unrelated incident of robbery.[7][8][9][10][11] The lookout man for the contract killing, Glossy Bruce Joseph, was arrested in May 1991 and later convicted and sentenced to 25 years in 1993.[12][13] Hitler Fleurinord was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and accused of being the driver.[7] Thermitus was never implicated or charged in the murders.[6][11]\n",

Wilder is also believed to have raped two girls, aged 10 and 12, in Florida in 1983. Since his death, he has also been considered a suspect in many unsolved murders, including the unsolved 1965 murder of two teenaged girls in his native Sydney, where he had lived during the same period.\nChristopher Bernard Wilder was born on March 13, 1945, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia,[2] the oldest of four sons to an American father, a naval officer, and an Australian mother.

Eugene, 31, employed at a car wash at the time, was divorced with a series of petty criminal arrests from age 16, with the last in 2009. While police sources speculated that the use of a street drug like \"bath salts\" might have been a factor,[3] experts expressed doubt, since toxicology reports were only able to identify small amounts of marijuana in Eugene's system, leaving the ultimate cause of his behavior unknown.[4] Poppo, 65, a graduate of Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School, was homeless and had long been presumed dead by his estranged family.\nOn the morning of May 26, 2012, 31-year-old Rudy Eugene drove to Miami Beach, Florida, to Urban Beach Week.[5] After spending 30\u201340 minutes at the site, as filmed on security video in and around the car,[5] he abandoned it about noon, and began to cross the 3-mile-long (4.8\u00a0km) span of the MacArthur Causeway, stripping himself of his clothing and disposing of his driver's license as he advanced westward, according to eyewitnesses.[6] His vehicle was eventually discovered and towed by Miami Beach police. Inside the car, police discovered a Bible and five empty water bottles, which they believed had been recently consumed.[5]\n",

The Lindbergh case inspired Congress to pass legislation that allowed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate kidnappings in any state under certain conditions, one of which was a ransom demand.[3] Despite this legislation, ransom kidnappings continued to be a major concern at the time when James Bailey Cash Jr. was abducted in May 1938.[4]\n",

Between 1915 and 1924, the self-styled \"King of the Everglades\" or \"Swamp Bandit\" operated from various hideouts in the Florida Everglades. His gang robbed nearly $1 million from at least 40 banks while at the same time hijacking numerous shipments of illegal whiskey being smuggled into the state from the Bahamas. Indeed, Ashley's gang was so effective that rum-running on the Florida coast virtually ceased while the gang was active. His two-man raid on the West End in the Bahamas in 1924 marked the first time in over a century that American pirates had attacked a British Crown colony.\nAmong poor Florida \"crackers\", he was considered a folk hero who represented a symbol of resistance to bankers, lawmen and wealthy landowners. Ashley's activities also hindered Prohibition bootleggers in major cities, whose importation of foreign liquor undermined local moonshiners. Even the newspapers of the era frequently compared him to Jesse James. Almost every major crime in Florida was blamed on Ashley and his gang and one Florida official called him the greatest threat to the state since the Seminole Wars. His near 13-year feud with Palm Beach County Sheriff George B. Baker ended in the death of Ashley and his three lieutenants in 1924.\nJohn Ashley was born and raised in the backwoods country along the Caloosahatchee River in the community of Buckingham, Florida near Fort Myers, Florida. He was one of nine children born to Joe Ashley, a poor Florida woodsman, who made his living by fishing, hunting, and trapping otters. The Ashley family moved from Fort Myers to Pompano in the 1890s where Joe Ashley and his older sons worked on the new railroad being built by industrialist Henry Flagler.[1] In 1911, Joe moved his family to West Palm Beach and briefly served as county sheriff. John Ashley spent much of his youth in the Florida Everglades and, like his father, became a skilled trapper and alligator hunter.[2]\n",

Darden's case was notable because of the 14 years that he spent on death row between his death sentence and his execution, which, at the time, was longer than the time any other inmate in the United States had spent on death row prior to their execution. He was also notable for the number of protests and amount of controversy and attention that his case attracted worldwide, as well as the unusually large number of death warrants that he lived through prior to his execution.\nWillie Darden was born in Greene County, North Carolina on June 1, 1933. His family lived in poverty as Darden grew up. His father was an auto-mechanic, and his great-grandfather had been a slave who was also born in Greene County. Darden's mother was 15 years old at the time of his birth, and two years after he was born, she died while giving birth to another child. Because of his family's poverty, Darden could not attend school regularly and instead worked in the farms, eventually dropping out of school after completing the eighth grade.[1]\nWhen Darden was a teenager, he started breaking the law, starting after he was caught stealing from a mailbox. Upon his first violation of the law at the age of 16, Darden was sent to a juvenile detention facility. After being discharged, Darden had trouble finding work and was eventually rearrested for cashing a bad check. He received a 4-year sentence in prison for the bad check. Until the murder in 1973, Darden was repeatedly in and out of prison for a variety of crimes, including assault, forgery, theft, and attempted rape. At the time of the murder, Darden was on furlough from prison while serving 20 years in a Florida prison for attempting to rape a 70-year-old woman in 1968.[1][2]\n",

The discrediting of the case against Lucas for crimes for which Toole had offered corroborating statements created doubts as to whether either was a genuine serial killer or, as Hugh Aynesworth suggested, both were merely compliant interviewees who police used to clear unsolved murders from the books.\nToole received two death sentences, but on appeal, they were commuted to life imprisonment. He died in his cell from cirrhosis, at age 49. Police attributed the 1981 murder of Adam Walsh to Toole on the basis of recanted statements. Lucas had backed Toole's confession to the Walsh murder, claiming that he had been in possession of the victim's severed head, though Lucas had a reputation for false confessions.\n",

He and Ashbrook spent the day fishing and swimming with Partin's daughter, then 6, before returning to the New Port Richey house where he and his daughter were living. Prosecutors think Ashbrook was killed between 9 p.m. and midnight. The next morning, workers found her body in woods off Shady Hills Road. She had been strangled, her throat gashed and her neck broken. Nine days after the discovery, Partin dropped his daughter off at the home of a foster mother, Jean Prestridge, later known as Jean Edenfield, in Wauchula and left the state. His daughter Patrisha's two sisters lived with this foster mother in her Wauchula home.

He was convicted of second-degree murder, armed robbery and armed burglary in 1989 and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Partin was released from prison on August 1, 1995.

When the Bellush family moved to Florida, he tracked her down using a private investigator and plotted to hire a man to beat her up. Blackthorne asked Daniel Alex Rocha, a golfing acquaintance with a minor criminal history, for help. Rocha was allegedly motivated to carry out the crime when told by Blackthorne that Sheila was abusing the two children, Stevie and Daryl.[2] Rocha then contacted a friend, Samuel Gonzales, who introduced him to his cousin, Jose Luis Del Toro, who agreed to do the attack for $14,000.[1][3]\n",

After desegregation, much of the racial violence in Miami had calmed only to be reignited by the 1980s.[1] The decade of riots were the result of policing controversies and ethnic tensions fueled by the perceived threat of recent immigrants to African Americans on the Miami job market.[2]\nIn the United States through the 1960s, desegregation was empowering once disadvantaged African American communities to reach new political and economic gains. In Miami the Cuban exile seemed to undercut new African American gains as Cubans began to compete for jobs, residence, and political power. The later perceived successes of many Cubans gave a feeling of powerlessness to local African Americans. Many Cuban refugees lacked English language skills and ended up living in lower income neighborhoods and taking up blue collar jobs that many African Americans also held. In 1963, Ebony magazine characterized the Cuban exile as an \"invasion\" bringing in \"grave social and economic problems.\"[3]\nBy 1968, Miami witnessed a riot in its Liberty City neighborhood during the 1968 Republican National Convention, caused by the frustration African Americans faced in the country.[4] By the 1970s, the Hispanic population of Miami outnumbered the African American population and more Hispanic owned businesses had been opened than African American owned businesses.[3]\n",

The anthology was created to give LGBTQ writers a chance to reflect upon the role of the gay bar in their lives and to express its importance to non-LGBTQ people.[1]\nThe massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida brought LGBT club life into the public view. However, it became apparent that many people outside of the LGBTQ community did not truly understand the role that bars and clubs play in the community and how their importance evolved over the years.[2]\nWhen writer Renee Bess read Lee Lynch's blog, \"Freedom Clothes\", she noticed the historical descriptions of gay bar life mirrored the contemporary descriptions of the gay bar's role in the lives of LGBTQ persons. Despite the commonly accepted belief that the gay bar is a place of refuge and self-affirmation, it is also a place that offers different experiences to different members of the LGBTQ community. Bess felt it was important to have a discussion about the significance of the gay bar/club in LGBTQ culture. The idea of inviting writers to contribute their pieces of short fiction, slices of their bar-related memoirs, and their poetry to an anthology came to mind as a means of sharing the LGBTQ club experience with the world.[2][3]\n",

After subsequent investigations, he was presumed to have drowned in Lake Seminole, a large reservoir located in the southwest corner of Georgia along its border with Florida; investigators later came to suspect he had been the victim of foul play, possibly at another location.[3] His body was found in October 2017 near Tallahassee,[4] and Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) officials confirmed Williams was a victim of homicide.[5]\nAfter Williams's boat was found abandoned on the lake, the initial theory was that he had fallen out of it after a collision. However, a lengthy and exhaustive search of the lake bed in the area failed to find his body: at that time, it was the only known occasion when no remains or body had been discovered after a drowning death in the lake.[6] It was eventually concluded that his body had been eaten by alligators. After waders and a jacket containing Williams's hunting license were found in the lake six months later, he was declared legally dead, following a court petition by his widow, Denise.

        "paragraph": "Adrianna Elaine Hutto (September 16, 1999 \u2013 August 8, 2007) was a 7-year-old American girl who lived in Esto, Florida.[1] On August 8, 2007, Adrianna's mother, Amanda E. Lewis, made a 911 call stating that she had found her daughter in the family's pool and she was not breathing.[2] Emergency personnel rushed Adrianna to the nearby hospital Bay Medical,[3] where she was pronounced dead about an hour after arrival. The death was initially treated as an accident until Adrianna's half-brother A.J., then 6 years old, told police that he had witnessed his mother \"dunk\" Adrianna in the pool as a form of corporal punishment.[4]\nDuring the investigation, police discovered that Adrianna had been diagnosed with ADHD and Lewis stated that while she initially had trouble bonding with her daughter, her affection for Adrianna had grown over time.[4] Investigators also found that neither Adrianna nor A.J. appeared to have any toys in the house, to which Lewis stated that the toys had been taken away for a week as a form of punishment and that the toys were stored in a shed. After searching the shed, investigators noted that there were no toys in the shed or any evidence to suggest that they had been there. There was a little red wagon and two inflatable toys for the pool in the yard but no other toys.[4] Dr. Renee Fox, the emergency room physician who had handled Adrianna's medical care, informed investigators that Lewis had not shown any emotion or reaction when informed that her daughter had died, which she had found odd.[3] Lewis submitted to and passed a lie detector test where she claimed that she had not killed her daughter.[5][4] In September 2007, Lewis was arrested and charged with the first-degree murder of Adrianna.[6] She was offered a plea bargain that would have required her to plead guilty to manslaughter and receive a ten-year sentence, which she declined in favor of going to trial.\nLewis went to trial in February 2008,[7] where the statements by A.J. and Dr. Fox were brought up as evidence and the defense argued that A.J. was not a reliable witness, as his story had changed several times during further questioning.[8] Other evidence brought to trial included an autopsy performed by Dr. Charles Siebert, statements from Lewis's co-workers, evidence of poor housekeeping, and the lack of toys, including Lewis's statement over the toys' whereabouts.[9] The prosecution also pointed out multiple bruises on Adrianna's forehead that correlated with A.J.'s testimony.[4] Four days after the case went to trial and after only two hours (including lunch) of deliberation, the jury found Lewis guilty of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.[10] In March of the same year, Lewis was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[8]\n",

Once Doty's case went back to the trial court that sentenced him for post-conviction appeals, he initially asked the lower court to dismiss his attorney and waive all his appeals.[6] However, in 2016, the United States Supreme Court in Hurst v. Florida[7] declared Florida's capital sentencing laws unconstitutional. The old law called for a majority vote of the jury to sentence a defendant to death.[8] The new law calls for a unanimous jury vote of death in order to sentence a defendant to death. In 2016 Doty's first death sentence was thrown out. He was retried two years later, and the jury unanimously voted to sentence him to death again on May 15, 2018. Although Florida has yet to set Doty's execution date, Doty is the only inmate on Florida's death row who has chosen the electric chair over lethal injection as the preferred method of execution.[9]\n",

Ford got out of the truck and asked Shakespeare if he wanted a soda. Shakespeare instead asked Ford to buy him two lottery tickets. Shakespeare said that he paid Ford $2 for the tickets out of the $5 he had on him that day.[3]\nFord later approached Shakespeare demanding a share of the jackpot of no less than $1 million, which Shakespeare refused to pay, prompting Ford to sue Shakespeare and alleging that Shakespeare stole lottery tickets out of Ford's wallet.[3] The jury did not believe Ford's stolen lottery tickets story and Shakespeare prevailed in the courts. Shakespeare had chosen a one-time, lump sum cash payment of $17 million.[4] He moved out of his working-class neighborhood in Lakeland, Florida and into a gated community.[5] Several months after his lottery win, apart from a $1 million home, his only other major purchases included a Nissan Altima and a Rolex watch from a pawnshop.[6] By late January 2010 the sheriff involved in the investigation of Shakespeare's disappearance told AP that the lottery money \"is gone now.\"[7]\n",

Whites killed four black men, including Charles Wright, who was lynched by being burned at the stake, and they also destroyed several buildings in the black community of Perry after the murder of Ruby Hendry, a white female schoolteacher.[1] [2]\nThe body of a young white woman, Annie \"Ruby\" Hendry, was found with her throat slashed, lying in a pool of blood, at 4:40\u00a0p.m. on December 2, 1922, in Perry in Taylor County, Florida. Her face was badly disfigured from having been beaten with a blunt instrument, so it took half an hour to determine her identity. On December 5, the police had linked the murder weapons found at the scene, a double-barrelled shotgun and a bloody razor, to a black man who had been residing in the area and using the name \"Charley Wright\". He was determined to be an escaped convict from adjacent Dixie County. [3] Search parties with guns and bloodhounds were everywhere.[4] Each night after the body was found, buildings serving the black community in Perry were burnt down: schoolhouse, lodge, amusement hall, and then the church.\nAuthorities deputized local citizens and the roads were sealed. On December 6, Cubrit Dixon, a black man coming from Madison County into Taylor County, was stopped and told to put his hands up by armed citizens who had been deputized. Dixon was shot and killed when he did not comply, and witnesses said he had seemed to be reaching for a gun in his back pocket. Examination of his body found only a closed pocketknife in his back pocket.[5]\n",

Ninety seconds later, when officers arrived, the gunmen opened fire on the officers, who then returned fire on the gunmen. The gunmen left in a U-Haul van, which they later ditched in a suburban neighborhood one mile away.[7] The suspects then carjacked a UPS delivery truck at gunpoint and took the driver hostage. The two continued their escape in the UPS truck, heading on Interstate 75 into Broward County.[5]\n",

He advanced relatively quickly though the minor League hierarchy, making the majors in 1976 as a late season replacement. With Mike Hargrove at first base, Ault became available in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft where he was drafted by the Blue Jays. He became the starting first baseman in their first regular season game, and his actions that day turned Ault into the Blue Jays first superstar. However, he did not meet the expectations set for him, had an otherwise average career, and was out of the majors within three years.\n",

        "paragraph": "William Lozano\nClement Lloyd, Allan Blanchard\nThe 1989 Miami riot was sparked after Miami Police Department (MPD) officer William Lozano shot Black motorcyclist Clement Lloyd on January 16, 1989. Lloyd, 23, was fleeing from another MPD officer who was chasing him for an alleged traffic violation. Lozano was on foot investigating an unrelated incident, heard about the situation on his police radio and later stated the motorcycle \"veered toward him\". Lozano fired a shot at the motorcycle, striking Lloyd in the head and killing him instantly. The motorcycle crashed into an oncoming car, injuring two occupants. Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, died the following day from his injuries. Several Black witnesses stated that Lozano walked almost to the center of the street with his handgun and poised ready to shoot for several seconds as the motorcyle approached.[2] Rioting began almost immediately after the shooting in Overtown,[3][2] and on the following day in Liberty City, both predominantly Black neighborhoods of Miami, and continued until January 19 when the Chicago Bulls including star player Michael Jordan played a scheduled game in Overtown against the Miami Heat, who were in their inaugural season.[2][4] Schools were closed and police cordoned off a 130-block area and teargassed rioting crowds.[1]\n",

He was arrested on July 24.[3] After his arrest, Walls was implicated in the unsolved murders of Cynthia Sue Condra, (Age 19) and Tommie Lou Whiddon, (Age 19) who were murdered on March 26, 1985, when Walls was only 17.[2] He was also linked by circumstantial evidence to the murder of Audrey Gygi, (Age 47) who was murdered on May 2, 1987.[citation needed] Walls was convicted of the murders and was sentenced to death in 1991.[citation needed] However, a new trial occurred in 1994, and Walls was re-sentenced to death.[citation needed]\n",

The Federal Bureau of Investigation claimed Osmakac bought explosives and firearms from an undercover agent. He had been under investigation since September 2011, when a confidential source informed federal authorities that Osmakac walked into a business seeking al-Qaeda flags.[9]\n",

Afterward, reports held that the Indians' primary objective was to steal horses from Thomas Clark's wagon train party, and that the Indians killed Clark's mother and brother and another man traveling with them during the horse robbery.\nThomas Clark was an Englishman who loved hunting.  He came overland to the Willamette Valley in Oregon in 1848, but soon decamped with Jackson Vandevert and others to the California Gold Rush.  They decided to invest their gains in bringing high quality cattle and horses to Oregon.  By the spring of 1851 Thomas had acquired 17 horses[1] and a few cattle from Kentucky and Illinois.[2]   On the trail west he brought with him his mother, his 25-year-old sister Grace, his 17-year-old brother, Hodgson, another brother named Charlie, and another married sister with her family.  He had a first class hack built for Grace to drive and his mother to ride in.[3]  It may have been the first such vehicle to cross the plains.[4] He had also become the pilot for several other Illinois families headed to Oregon.[5]   The company moved slowly so the animals could graze and arrive in Oregon in good condition.[6]\nCho Cho Co was only twenty years old in 1851 but was already a veteran guerilla fighter.  He led a band of warriors of the Tussawehee sub-tribe of the Shoshone, the most powerful tribe in the area that would become Eastern Oregon, Idaho, and Western Montana.  In this area, the Shoshone were often known by white people as the Snakes.  By late August, the band was short of supplies, particularly good horses, guns, and ammunition.  Cho Cho Co traveled east along the Oregon Trail to meet his uncle, Deer Fly, and borrow soldiers from him.  Now reinforced, he identified the Clark party as his target.[7]\n"

On or about February 4, 1896, two Mormon sheepherders were killed by an unknown assailant while they were camping along a creek in what was then part of Cassia County, Idaho.\nThe gunfighter Diamondfield Jack Davis and his associate Jack Gleason were arrested, but the latter was released and Diamondfield Jack was pardoned in 1902, after serving six years in jail. The deaths of the two sheepherders are the only confirmed killings attributed to the conflict, however, according to author J. Anthony Lukas, the incident was \"one of the last great confrontations in the sheep and cattle wars.\"[1][2][3]\nThe leading figure in the conflict was a prominent cattleman named John Sparks. Sparks came to southern Idaho from Nevada in the early 1870s. A former Texas Ranger, Sparks was one of the first people to explore what was still a very isolated wilderness. He later became the partner of another rancher named Jasper Harrell and eventually they established a series of ranches on both sides of the Idaho\u2013Nevada border. By the summer of 1895, Sparks was the most powerful cattleman in Idaho. He controlled huge stretches of territory, though his ownership was still mostly unofficial. Sparks felt that because he had used the lands for so many years without opposition, there was no way he was going to let the hated sheep destroy it.\n"

Her son died in a fire that was caused by a portable heater that ignited his blankets.[5] The boy died, and Row collected $28,000 from the life insurance policy.[citation needed]\nAs the investigation progressed, Row was embezzling money from the YMCA where she worked.[6] Detectives found that Row had taken out life insurance policies on her husband and children, totaling over a quarter of a million dollars.

Bundy often revisited his victims, grooming and performing sexual acts with the corpses until decomposition and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. At least twelve of his victims were decapitated and their severed heads kept as mementos in his apartment.

In 1916, after being accused of murdering his wife, he escaped from jail with a sawblade he had hidden in his shoe. Loveless's dismembered torso was found stuffed in a sack in an Idaho cave in 1979 with more of his remains discovered in 1991 in the same cave. The body was not positively identified until 2019 with the help of the DNA Doe Project, which noted that the identification was the oldest one they had ever made. The positive identification was made using forensic genealogy.[2]\nJoseph Henry Loveless was born on December 3, 1870,[3] according to some online sources, Loveless was born on December 28, 1870, at, Payson, in what was then Utah Territory. His mother, Sarah Jane Scriggins, was from Massachusetts while his father, Joseph Jackson Loveless, was from Indiana. Both of his parents were early pioneers from the Latter Day Saint movement.[1]\n"

He was assassinated in 1905 by one-time union member Harry Orchard, who was also a paid informant for the Cripple Creek Mine Owners' Association.[1] Orchard attempted to implicate leaders of the radical Western Federation of Miners in the assassination. The labor leaders were found not guilty[2] in two trials,[3] but Orchard spent the rest of his life in prison.\nBorn in Keokuk, Iowa, and raised in Knoxville, Steunenberg was the fourth of ten children of Bernardus and Cornelia (Keppel) Steunenberg, with five brothers and four sisters.[4] He attended Iowa State College at Ames and then went on to become a printer's apprentice and publisher. In 1881 he was hired by the Des Moines Register in Des Moines. Steunenberg later published a newspaper in Knoxville until 1886, when he moved west and settled in Caldwell, Idaho Territory, where he joined his younger brother Albert K. Steunenberg (1863\u20131907) in taking over the Caldwell Tribune for six years.[5]\nSteunenberg became active in politics as a member of the 1889 Idaho Constitutional Convention which led to Idaho's admission to the Union in 1890. In 1890, he was elected to the Idaho House of Representatives as a fusion candidate, endorsed by both the Democratic and Populist Parties, and he served one term.

In 1900, the company opened a company-built Kellogg school building, contributed to the construction of local churches, and started a loan program so employees could own their homes.[1]:\u200a23,\u200a26,\u200a35\u200a\n"

The response to that violence, disastrous for the local miners' union, became the primary motivation for the formation of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) the following year.\nThe confrontation of 1899 resulted from the miners' frustrations with mine operators that paid lower wages; hired Pinkerton or Thiel operatives to infiltrate the union; and routinely fired any miner who held a union card.\n"

Like the first incident  seven years earlier, the 1899 confrontation was an attempt by union miners, led by the Western Federation of Miners to unionize non-union mines, and have them pay the higher union wage scale. As with the 1892 strike, the 1899 incident culminated in a dynamite attack that destroyed a non-union mining facility, the burning of multiple homes and outbuildings and two murders, followed by military occupation of the district.\nThe riot of 1899 resulted from the miners' frustrations with mine operators that paid lower wages, hired Pinkerton or Thiel operatives to infiltrate the union, and the refusal of non-union miners to join or strike.\nAngered by wage cuts, Coeur d'Alene area miners conducted a strike in 1892. The strike erupted in violence when union miners discovered they had been infiltrated by a Pinkerton agent who had routinely provided union information to the mine owners. After several deaths, the U.S. army occupied the area and forced an end to the strike.

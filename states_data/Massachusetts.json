All had their throats slit with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. Thousands of dollars' worth of marijuana and money were left covering their mutilated bodies; in all, $5,000 was left in the apartment. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random.\nTamerlan Tsarnaev, the deceased suspect in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, had previously described murder victim Brendan Mess as his best friend, though before Mess was murdered there had been animosity between Tsarnaev and Mess over Mess's \"lifestyle\". After the bombings and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev's personal life, the Waltham murders case was reexamined in April 2013 with Tsarnaev as a new suspect.[2] Authorities said Tsarnaev and his younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may have been responsible for the triple homicide, that forensic evidence connected them to the scene of the killings, and that their cell phone records placed them in the area. While police in the first investigation said that victims were killed on September 12, The Boston Globe, Boston Herald, and The Wall Street Journal reported that at least one relative of the victims believes that the killings took place on September 11.[2][4]\n",

This was not suspected to be the work of one serial killer, as at least four different men were charged on account of these murders. The Boston Globe was one of the only media outlets to cover the killings. Those most vocal about these incidents, however, were Black feminist groups, such as the Combahee River Collective, who drew connections between the violent deaths and the multiple systematically marginalized identities of the Black, female victims.\nDuring the 1970s, the Boston area endured severe racial tensions and a lethal social climate. The Roxbury neighborhood and surrounding neighborhoods, where the African-American victims were found, were in the middle of social movements that started with the desegregation of public schools. In 1974, this desegregation led to numerous of events such a riots, protests, and violent actions that occurred on both sides and led to a number of hospitalizations and deaths. Initially, the neighborhoods surrounding Roxbury belonged to certain racial groups such as Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans, and African-Americans. As Judge Garrity ordered that the school and buses be desegregated, people from different backgrounds were forced to intermingle and co-habitat.[1] With raised tensions, there were many people that suffered various attacks. Examples include, but are not limited to, the stabbing of an African-American attorney, the public beating and death of a white male, a group of African-American high school students being trapped in the school for hours by an angry mob, and the brutal attack on an African-American football player.[2]\nChristine (Chris) Ricketts, 15 was found on the sidewalk on East Lenox Street in Roxbury on January 29, 1979 with Andrea Foye.[3]\n",

Seven years later, they were executed in the electric chair at Charlestown State Prison.\nAfter a few hours' deliberation on July 14, 1921, the jury convicted Sacco and Vanzetti of first-degree murder and they were sentenced to death by the trial judge.

The appeals were based on recanted testimony, conflicting ballistics evidence, a prejudicial pretrial statement by the jury foreman, and a confession by an alleged participant in the robbery.

For these crimes, Gaynor was subsequently given four sentences of life imprisonment without parole.[1]\nLittle is known about Gaynor's early years. He was born on December 10, 1966, in Springfield, as one of several children. After school, having no education, he was forced to engage in low-skill labor. Later, in the late 1980s, he mastered his dream job and began work at an automobile repair shop, while periodically also engaging in day labor.[1] At this time, he developed an addiction to drugs and alcohol. In the early 1990s, as a result of his drug addiction, Gaynor began leading a marginalized lifestyle.[2][3]\nIn early April 1995, Gaynor began his murder spree, first starting with 45-year-old Vera E. Hallums, whom he asked to spend a night in her apartment. In the middle of the night, Gaynor attacked the sleeping woman, tying her up and beating her; Hallums subsequently died of a brain injury. After her death, he raped the corpse, robbed the apartment and disappeared into the night. Hallums' body was found on April 20.[4]\n",

During the riot, a convent of Roman Catholic Ursuline nuns was burned down by a Protestant mob. The event was triggered by reported abuse of a member of the order, and was fueled by the rebirth of extreme anti-Catholic sentiment in antebellum New England.\nFrom the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, little tolerance was exhibited by the Puritan leadership even toward Protestant views that did not accord with theirs. When the Province of Massachusetts Bay was established in 1692, its charter protected freedom of worship for Protestants in general, but specifically excluded Roman Catholics.[1] After American independence, there was a broadening of tolerance in the nation, but this tolerance did not particularly take hold in Massachusetts.[2] The arrival of many Catholic Irish immigrants ignited sectarian tensions, which were abetted by the Protestant religious revivals of the Second Great Awakening.[3]\nThe idea of establishing an Ursuline school in Boston originated with Father John Thayer, a Massachusetts native who converted to Roman Catholicism after a transformative experience in Rome in 1783. Thayer died in 1815, having recruited several nuns in Ireland for the project, and donated his estate to the cause.[4] In 1820, the Most Reverend Jean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus, bishop of the newly created diocese of Boston, oversaw the opening of the convent in the rectory of the Boston cathedral. A school for girls was set up in the convent, intended to educate the area's poor. Approximately 100 students were eventually enrolled. The early years of the school were plagued by tuberculosis, which claimed the lives of the convent's first mother superior and several of the sisters. A new leader, Mother Mary Edmond St. George, was recruited from the Ursuline convent in Trois Rivieres, Quebec, where the Boston nuns had trained.[5]\n",

More than 20 years later, Martha Corey had an illegitimate, mixed race son named Benoni.[3] Benoni was thought to have an African biological father and represented living proof of Corey's \"checkered\" past in a time where pre-marital sex, especially with non-white partners, was considered sinful and shameful by the ultra-stringent Christianity of the colonies.[4]\nCorey married Henry Rich in 1684 and had a second son named Thomas Rich. After the death of her first husband, she married wealthy farmer Giles Corey in the year 1690. Benoni lived with Corey and her husband Giles, so town members were aware of him.[4] Both Giles and Martha had a controversial past that contributed to their death in the Salem Witch Trials.[5]\n",

It was common practice for the larger local grain merchants to hoard grain to drive up local prices, and to sell local grain in more lucrative foreign markets such as Europe or the sugar plantations of the West Indies. On top of this, Queen Anne's War (1702\u20131713) interfered with foreign trade. By 1709, Boston was experiencing a serious food shortage and skyrocketing bread prices.\nThe hardest hit were the working poor. Since they did not own land, and were therefore not allowed to vote, governmental indifference to their needs left violence as the only effective recourse.

Horton (born August 12, 1951), commonly referred to as \"Willie Horton\", is an American convicted felon who became notorious for committing violent crimes while on furlough from prison, where he was serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for murder.[1] Released for a weekend as the beneficiary of a Massachusetts furlough program, he failed to return, and was later recaptured and convicted of committing assault, armed robbery, and rape in Maryland, where he remains incarcerated.\nThe controversy over Horton's furlough became a major issue in the 1988 presidential election, as US Vice President and Republican nominee George H. W. Bush brought Horton up frequently during his campaign against Massachusetts governor and Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. He was commonly referred to as \"Willie\" Horton, despite never having gone by the nickname. The re-naming of the African-American Horton has been speculated to be the product of racist stereotyping.[2] A prominent PAC ad for Bush about Horton has been widely characterized as a textbook example of dog-whistle politics.[3][4][5][6][7]\n",

Lee Bailey and informed him of this confession, which led to DeSalvo becoming the prime suspect in the unsolved Strangler murders.\nNassar was born in Providence, Rhode Island, the oldest of two children of Henry Nassar and Helen (n\u00e9e George), both of Syriac descent. Henry had come to America with his parents as a child and worked at various mills in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He died there in 1955. Helen was born in Dover, New Hampshire, and worked as a bobbin setter in mills; a previous marriage (that ended in 1931) to a man named Lawrence Otis, yielded one son named after his father. Nassar has one sister named Eileen. Eileen and George grew up in Lawrence, and were Catholics. George was involved in sports, and was a Boy Scout. At school, his teachers found him reserved, quiet, and a poor mixer.\nGeorge first ran afoul of the law while he was in his sophomore year. In May 1948, he and two of his friends, Gennaro Pullino and William Kenney went on a robbery spree that netted eighty dollars. In one of the places they hit, shopowner Dominic Kirmil lunged at the trio with a Coke bottle; Nassar pulled out a nickel-plated revolver from his dark-colored trench coat and shot Kirmil four times. The shopkeeper died three hours later from the loss of blood. Several witnesses described Nassar's distinct trench coat to the police.\n",

Warren enlisted Paul Revere and William Dawes on April 18, 1775, to leave Boston and spread the alarm that the British garrison in Boston was setting out to raid the town of Concord and arrest rebel leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams. Warren participated in the Battles of Lexington and Concord the following day, the opening engagements of the American Revolutionary War.[1]\nWarren had been commissioned a major general in the colony's militia shortly before the June 17, 1775 Battle of Bunker Hill. Rather than exercise his rank, Warren chose to participate in the battle as a private soldier, and was killed in combat when British troops stormed the redoubt atop Breed's Hill. His death, immortalized in John Trumbull's painting, The Death of General Warren at the Battle of Bunker's Hill, June 17, 1775, galvanized the rebel forces. Warren has been memorialized in the naming of many towns, counties, streets, and other locations in the United States, by statues, and in numerous other ways.\nJoseph Warren was born in Roxbury, Province of Massachusetts Bay, to Joseph and Mary (n\u00e9e Stevens) Warren. His father was a respected farmer who died in October 1755 when he fell off a ladder while gathering fruit in his orchard. After attending the Roxbury Latin School, Joseph enrolled in Harvard College, graduating in 1759, and then taught for about a year at Roxbury Latin.[2] He studied medicine and married 18-year-old heiress Elizabeth Hooten on September 6, 1764.

He threatened Roosevelt that if he did not help, Charles would release information that would be embarrassing to the NYPD.

Hundreds of mostly working-class rioters rampaged through Boston, paralyzed the provincial government, and captured several naval officers and the sheriff's deputy. After Knowles threatened to bombard the town, the British governor of Boston, William Shirley, persuaded him to release the Bostonians in exchange for the hostages.\nThe Knowles Riot was the largest impressment riot in North America, and the most serious uprising by the American colonists in Colonial America prior to the Stamp Act protests of 1765.[1] A few days after the incident, an anonymous writer\u2014probably Samuel Adams\u2014published a pamphlet praising the rioters for defending their natural rights.

While already serving a life sentence, Druce killed John Geoghan, a defrocked Roman Catholic priest who was convicted of sexually abusing children, and who had also been at the center of the Catholic sexual abuse scandal.\nIn August 2003, while in protective custody at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts, Geoghan was trapped in his cell by Druce, who jammed the door closed so correction officers could not reach him.  Druce then strangled and stomped Geoghan to death.  An autopsy revealed Geoghan's cause of death to be \"ligature strangulation and blunt chest trauma.\"\nThe state immediately began an investigation into procedures at the prison.  There have been questions raised about the wisdom and propriety of placing these two men in the same unit, since prison officials had been warned by another inmate that Druce had something planned.  It was noted while two guards are normally stationed in the unit where Geoghan and Druce were being held, there was only one officer in the unit at the time \u2013 one had left temporarily to escort another inmate to a medical station.  Union officials had noted there were staffing cuts previously at the prison, which they feel led to the prison being a more dangerous and volatile place.[3]\n",

Gerhartsreiter lived well solely on his wife's income. However, she became dissatisfied with his secretive, controlling behavior and sought a divorce. Inquiries on her behalf revealed that he had fabricated his name and his family background. The couple divorced and Gerhartsreiter agreed to accept limited access to his daughter on supervised visits.

He was subsequently convicted of the custodial kidnapping of his daughter.\nIn addition to Clark Rockefeller, Gerhartsreiter's aliases include Christopher Kenneth Gerhart, Christopher Chichester, Christopher C.

Mary and William were Puritans who were interested in reforming the Anglican Church from within, without separating from it.  As the English king increased pressure on the Puritans, they left England by the thousands to go to New England in the early 1630s. Mary and William arrived in Boston by 1635, joining the Boston Church in December of that year.  Like most members of Boston's church, they soon became involved in the Antinomian Controversy, a theological crisis lasting from 1636 to 1638.  Mary and William were strong advocates of  Anne Hutchinson and John Wheelwright in the controversy, and as a result, Mary's husband was disenfranchised and disarmed for supporting these \"heretics\" and also for harboring his own heretical views.

        "paragraph": "\nDue to King Philips' War, tensions were rising along the East coast, and in 1677, a riot in Marblehead, Massachusetts transpired. After Native American troops devised a plan to intercept and capture fishing boats from the English, citizens of Massachusetts decided that it was time to fight back. This led to several English fishermen capturing two natives and bringing them to a port in Marblehead. The natives were then violently beaten to by a group of angry women.\nIn 1677, Marblehead, Massachusetts was full of tension much like many of the east coast colonies at the time. These tensions stemmed from King Philip's War which took place from 1675 to 1678.[1] This war involved guerilla warfare in which it is reported that nearly every citizen of Marblehead, Massachusetts had lost a family member or friend.[2] In addition to losing friends and family members, Marblehead was hit hard economically due to an interference in trade and rising taxes to fund the war.[3] Scholars have stated that King Philip's war \"amounted to twenty-one pounds per household, a sum more than the annual salary of the deputy governor of Connecticut at the time.\"[3]\n",

The $2.775 million ($31.3 million today) theft consisted of $1,218,211.29 in cash and $1,557,183.83 in checks, money orders, and other securities. It was at the time the largest robbery in the history of the United States, and has been called \"the crime of the century\". The robbery remained unsolved for nearly six years, until estranged group member Joseph O'Keefe testified only days before the statute of limitations would have expired. \nOf the eleven people involved in the robbery, eight would receive life sentences after a trial, with two others dying before they could be convicted. Less than $60,000 of the more than $2.7 million stolen would ever be recovered. The robbery received significant press coverage, and was eventually adapted into four movies.\nThe robbery was first conceived in 1947; however, in 1948, after months of planning, the group learned that Brink's had moved to a new location. While the theft was originally intended to be a burglary, rather than an armed robbery, they could not find a way around the building's burglar alarm. After observing the movements of the guards, they decided that the robbery should take place just after 7 pm, as the vault would be open and fewer guards would be on duty.[14] Over a period of several months, the robbers removed each lock from the building and had a key made for it, before returning the lock.[15] Two vehicles were stolen: a truck, to carry away the loot from the robbery; and a car, which would be used to block any pursuit. Vincent Costa was the group's lookout, and signalled with a flashlight from a nearby rooftop when he saw the vault being opened.[3] After five aborted runs, Costa finally gave the go-ahead on the night of January 17, 1950.[14]\n",

Snelgrove, who was not acting in an unruly manner, was not Milien's intended target; he had fired at a different person in the crowd.[4] The crowd-control projectile hit Snelgrove in the eye, causing her to bleed heavily.

In 1661 King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism. In 1684 England revoked the Massachusetts charter, sent over a royal governor to enforce English laws in 1686, and in 1689 passed a broad Toleration act.\"[2][3]\nThe settlement of Boston was founded by Puritan chartered colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Colony under John Winthrop, and acquired the name of Boston soon after the arrival of the Winthrop Fleet in 1630. It was named after Boston, Lincolnshire, in England. During the 1640s, as the English Civil War reached its climax, the founder of English Quakerism, George Fox (1624\u20131691), discovered his religious vocation. Under the Puritan English Commonwealth led by Oliver Cromwell, Quakers in England were persecuted, and during the 1650s various groups of Quakers left England as 'Publishers of Truth'.[citation needed]\n",

She was the youngest of six siblings, and had three sisters, Mary (1644\u20131695), Sarah (1646\u20131716), and Hannah (1652\u20131698), and two brothers, Andrew (1657\u20131690) and John (1661\u20131690).\nOn 7 May 1674 when she was 7 months pregnant with her eldest child, she married Thomas Carrier (c. 1650\u20131739). After the marriage, they relocated to neighboring Billerica, some ten miles southwest of Andover, and lived in the north part of town near her sister Mary. [Note: According to the New England Historic Genealogical Society, Martha's spouse was born Thomas Morgan in Wales.  Furthermore, he died in Colchester, Connecticut in 1735, not in 1739 as shown in two places above.  According to Carrier family lore, Thomas was born in 1626, not in 1636 nor in 1650, as shown above.  The Carrier family believes that Thomas was 108 to 109 years old when he died, while walking home with a sack of grain over his shoulder.  The significance of the birth year is that Thomas is believed to have been involved in the execution of King Charles I in 1649.  The earlier birth year of 1626 would have made him 23 at the time of the execution; and, hence, he was a plausible participant.  Whereas, the later birth years of 1636 or 1650 would have made it impossible.  Some sources say he came to New England in 1674 and married Sarah at that time; one source says this actually occurred in 1664.  In either case, Thomas's arrival in New England would have been after the 1660 Restoration of Charles II, and suggests that Thomas was a regicide on the run, like others such as John Dixwell, Edward Whalley, and William Goffe.  Tellingly, he changed his name to Thomas Carrier at that time.  Thomas is believed to be the progenitor of virtually all of the Carriers in the United States, even though that was not his real name.  Willis Carrier, of air conditioning fame, is descended from Thomas and Martha.]  Martha had eight children, one of whom died in infancy:[2]\n",

Investigators said both Wright and Rahim were followers of a violent form of Islamic extremism.  Chairman Michael McCaul of the House Homeland Security Committee said that Rahim had been under investigation because he had been communicating with ISIS and spreading ISIS propaganda online.[1]  According to CNN, his Twitter feed showed that he had been communicating with Mujahid Miksi, an alias for Mohamed Abdullahi Hasan, a Minnesota man fighting with Al-Shabaab.[5]  According to a court affidavit, Wright later told investigators that he agreed with Rahim's plot and supported it.[6]\nAccording to The Atlantic, although Wright, Rahim and Rovinski were regarded as isolated, lone wolf actors at the time of their arrests, it later emerged that the three were \"part of a wider network that was in communication with Islamic State operatives in Syria.\" In 2015 Rahim and Wright provided the arrangements and raised the funds that enabled American would-be jihadi Zulfi Hoxha to travel to Syria, where he became a significant figure in ISIS.[7]\n",

It evolved from the British Guy Fawkes Night, which commemorates the failure of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Pope Night was most popular in the seaport towns of New England, especially in Boston, where it was an occasion for drinking, rioting, and anti-elite protest by the working class.\nGang violence became part of the tradition in the 1740s, with residents of different Boston neighborhoods battling for the honor of burning the pope's effigy. By the mid-1760s these riots had subsided, and as colonial America moved towards the American Revolution (1765-1783), the class rivalries of Pope Night gave way to anti-British sentiment. Under the leadership of Pope Night organizer Ebenezer Mackintosh, Boston's North and South End gangs united in protest against the Stamp Act of 1765. \nLocal authorities made several attempts to crack down on the festivities. In 1775, to avoid offending Canadian allies, George Washington issued an order forbidding any troops under his command from participating. The last known Pope Night celebration in Boston took place in 1776, though the tradition continued in other towns well into the 19th century.\n",

In retaliation Ann Putnam, Jr. and others accused him of witchcraft, and of murdering thirteen citizens.[2]\nSome of Willard's in-laws, the Wilkins, also made accusations against him. Benjamin Wilkins would tell the court that Willard had previously beat his wife, Samuel Wilkins testified that he had repeatedly been irritated and afflicted by an entity in a dark colored coat he identified as Willard. John Wilkins would blame the death of his wife, after having delivered a baby, on John Willard, and the family patriarch, Bray Wilkins, would say that he came down with an illness after John Willard had looked at him with an evil eye. Willard was found guilty of witchcraft on August 5, 1692. On August 19, 1692, he was hanged, along with John Proctor, George Burroughs, George Jacobs, Sr., and Martha Carrier.

He was reassigned to several parish posts involving interaction with children, even after receiving treatment for pedophilia.\nThe investigation and prosecution of Geoghan were one of the numerous cases of priests accused of child sexual abuse in a scandal that rocked the archdiocese in the 1990s and 2000s. It led to the resignation of Boston's archbishop, Cardinal Bernard Francis Law, on December 13, 2002. Law lost the support of fellow clergy and the laity after it was shown that his response to allegations against dozens of priests consisted of assigning them to different parishes, thus allowing sexual abuse of additional children to take place.[1]\nGeoghan was convicted of sexual abuse, laicized, and sentenced in 2002 to nine to ten years in Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, a maximum security prison. Less than a year later, he was murdered there by Joseph Druce, an inmate serving a life sentence. The Boston Globe's coverage of Geoghan's abuse opened the door for public knowledge of the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston[2] and Catholic churches nationwide in general.

He was accused of burning down a building[2] about six years before his death to try to gain freedom. Mark could read, and said that he read the Bible to find a way to kill his master without committing a sin. He struck upon poisoning because it did not involve the shedding of blood. According to historical documents from the investigation and judgement, Mark obtained arsenic from a doctor on the pretense it was to kill pigs, but furnished it to his sister who administered it to Codman. Several other slaves were also implicated in the plot.[2]\nIn 1755, Mark was convicted of assisting in the successful poisoning of his master, John Codman.[1] As punishment, Mark was hanged, tarred, and his body displayed in an iron gibbet for several years after his death at a well-known spot (at the time) in present-day Somerville, Massachusetts.[4] Mark's sister Phillis was tried for the actual act of poisoning; she was convicted and burned alive.[4]\n",

Team MR8, named after Martin Richard's initials and his favorite sports number, is composed of volunteer runners, including runners who may not usually qualify to run in the race due to their time scores.[3] The team members raise money for the foundation, which in turn invests in projects such as the Challenger Sports program at the Boys and Girls Club of Dorchester, the Martin Richard Park Project, and community clean-ups. Donations to the Challenger Sports club help finance athletics programs for children with disabilities.[4]\nDuring 2016's \"One Boston Day,\" held annually on April 15, the foundation sponsored a community clean-up of Dorchester's Peabody Square and Dorchester Avenue.[5] Team MR8 raised $1.25 million during the 2014 Boston Marathon Race[3] and raised over $2 million[4] as of March 2016.\n",

He and Dominic Daley were arrested on November 12, 1805, and convicted for the murder of Marcus Lyon. Lyon's body had been found on November 10 nearby Springfield, Massachusetts. Locals had seen strangers Halligan and Daley in the same area as Lyon's body the day before, and thirteen-year-old Laertes Fuller testified as such before a jury of inquest.[1] Police were sent after the pair on November 11 and arrested them the following day.[citation needed]\nThe trial for Commonwealth v. Dominic Daley and James Halligan was held in Northampton, Massachusetts. Halligan and Daley's lawyers were only given two days to set up a defense for their clients.[citation needed] The prosecution's main point was Fuller's testimony, despite the fact that this held no solid proof of the crime and that even Fuller was not certain Halligan was there. The defense's lawyers had no witnesses, and the laws at the time in Massachusetts prevented the defendants from arguing for themselves. The only argument in defense of Daley and Halligan was the closing statement made by one of their lawyers, Francis Blake. Blake pointed out that the men were being charged solely because of their Irish nationality, yet the jury returned with a guilty verdict in under one hour.[1]\nJean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus, a priest from Boston, came to assist them in their last moments, even through great personal risk. The two were hanged[citation needed] on June 5, 1806. An estimated 15,000 people came to Northampton to view the execution.[2]\n",

Bryan was a publisher, writer, poet, and journalist who is best known today for creating the home economics magazine Good Housekeeping that he would manage from 1885 until his death in 1899, during which time he published more than a hundred of his own poems in its issues.[1] Prior to this, Bryan was extensively involved in the reorganization of the Springfield Republican as editorial and business partner to Samuel Bowles, following the death of Bowles' father; Bryan entered the business in 1852 serving as partner in the paper's printing firm Samuel Bowles and Co. Upon Bowles' dissolution of the partnership with himself and several other minor shareholders in his paper's printing business, Bryan went on to rechristen it the Clark W. Bryan & Co., which purchased and expanded the Springfield Union from 1872 to 1882 when it was sold to its editor-in-chief Joseph Shipley.[2][3]\nFrom 1880 until his death Bryan was also responsible for a successful trade publication, The Paper World, which was published in various iterations in Holyoke, Springfield, and finally out of the Pulitzer Building in New York City. By the time the paper had been moved to the latter in 1898, Bryan retained little more than creative input,[4] and this sale to a separate company would ultimately fail.[5][6] Bryan, who had lived to see his business empire in financial ruin, and wife and one of his sons had passed in recent years, took his life on January 23, 1899, with a pistol. All of his publications were promptly discontinued, the sole exception being Good Housekeeping, which immediately found a purchaser, John Pettigrew, who would sell it to his printer George D. Chamberlain, who in turn sold it to E. H. Phelps, another former Springfield Republican associate, whose company, Phelps Publishing, had offices in Springfield and New York. Gradually reaching national prominence, it was purchased by the Hearst Corporation in 1911.[1][7]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe desegregation of Boston public schools (1974\u20131988) was a period in which the Boston Public Schools were under court control to desegregate through a system of busing students. The call for desegregation and the first years of its implementation led to a series of racial protests and riots that brought national attention, particularly from 1974 to 1976. In response to the Massachusetts legislature's enactment of the 1965 Racial Imbalance Act, which ordered the state's public schools to desegregate, W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts laid out a plan for compulsory busing of students between predominantly white and black areas of the city. The hard control of the desegregation plan lasted for over a decade. It influenced Boston politics and contributed to demographic shifts of Boston's school-age population, leading to a decline of public-school enrollment and white flight to the suburbs. Full control of the desegregation plan was transferred to the Boston School Committee in 1988; in 2013 the busing system was replaced by one with dramatically reduced busing.[11]\nOn April 1, 1965, a special committee appointed by Massachusetts Education Commissioner Owen Kiernan released its final report finding that more than half of black students enrolled in Boston Public Schools (BPS) attended institutions with enrollments that were at least 80 percent black and that housing segregation in the city had caused the racial imbalance.[12][13][14] From its creation under the National Housing Act of 1934 signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Federal Housing Administration used its official mortgage insurance underwriting policy explicitly to prevent school integration.[15] The Boston Housing Authority actively segregated the city's public housing developments since at least 1941 and continued to do so despite the passage of legislation by the 156th Massachusetts General Court prohibiting racial discrimination or segregation in housing in 1950 and the issuance of Executive Order 11063 by President John F. Kennedy in 1962 that required all federal agencies to prevent racial discrimination in federally-funded subsidized housing in the United States.[16][17]\n",

Thirteen women and two men were executed.[2]\nJones, who resided in Charlestown, now a section of Boston, was a midwife and practiced medicine. Some of what caused her to be accused of witchcraft had to do with these practices.[1] There are only two primary sources of information on Jones' plight: Governor John Winthrop's journal and the observations of minister John Hale, who, as a 12-year-old boy, had witnessed Jones' execution.[3]\nJohn Winthrop, as governor, and several other founders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony were among the members of the General Court which tried and convicted Margaret Jones for witchcraft. The others included deputy governor Thomas Dudley and assistant governors John Endicott, Richard Bellingham,  William Hibbins, Increase Nowell, Simon Bradstreet, John Winthrop, Jr., and William Pynchon. Ann Hibbins, who was executed for witchcraft in 1656, was reputed to be the sister of Richard Bellingham, and was the widow of William Hibbins.[3] William Hibbins was succeeded as assistant by Humphrey Atherton, who sat in judgment of Ann Hibbins.[4]\n",

By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, contributed to what would eventually be fatal for many, especially the majority of women. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh New England winter.[4]\n",

The next day, after she had failed to answer her phone and missed an important exam, her boyfriend went to the apartment and found her dead. The cause of death was found to be blunt force trauma from a blow to the head; she had been raped as well.[2]\nThe crime attracted national media attention, as Britton's father was an administrator at Radcliffe College, and several factors led to a presumption that Britton's killer had been an acquaintance, perhaps a fellow student or faculty member of Harvard's anthropology department. Her body had been sprinkled with red ochre powder, used in many ancient funerals of multiple civilizations.[3] No valuables had been taken from the apartment, nor had any of her neighbors heard any screams or other unusual noises (although later some were reported).\nInvestigators were unable to find any likely suspects among the anthropology department. Albert DeSalvo reportedly confessed to raping and murdering another woman who had lived in the same building in 1963, following his arrest as the Boston Strangler several years earlier, but doubts remained as to whether he had committed all the murders linked to the case. Some also considered that there might have been a second Boston Strangler, leading to speculation that, if there was, he might have killed Britton as well. The case went cold but continued to fascinate the media and true crime enthusiasts on the Internet, some of whom brought lawsuits to have records made public from the investigation in the hope of resolving the case.\n",

Jared previously worked for the Red Sox's security staff, but was fired after a Major League Baseball investigation implicated him in steroid distribution.\nRemy was born in 1978 to Jerry and Phoebe Remy. Due to his struggles with dyslexia and aggression, Weston, Massachusetts public schools paid for Remy to attend the Gifford School, a special education program for students with learning or behavioral problems. He was allowed to play after-school sports at Weston High School, but behavioral problems led to these privileges being revoked. On January 25, 1996, Jerry Remy called the Weston police because he was concerned that his son was harassing an ex-girlfriend. The ex-girlfriend and her father considered filing for a restraining order, but were concerned that Jared Remy would retaliate if they did. He also allegedly threatened her new boyfriend. After this incident, Remy was sent to Florida, where his father was covering Red Sox spring training.[2]\nUpon his return, Remy began dating Tiffany Guyette, who also attended the Gifford School. When he was nineteen, and Guyette was fifteen, she became pregnant. According to Guyette, Remy was verbally abusive and belittled her weight gain during her pregnancy. He also attempted to shove her out of a moving car. On January 18, 1997, Remy allegedly led a group of teens that assaulted a fifteen-year-old friend of Guyette's in Franklin, Massachusetts. The boy was later found by police incoherent; although he recovered from his \"life-threatening head injuries\", his relatives described his cognitive function and mood as permanently altered, and at twenty-two he shot himself to death.[2]\n",

Several other Friends lay under sentence of death at Boston in the same period, but had their punishments commuted to that of being whipped out of the colony from town to town.\n\"The hanging of Mary Dyer on the Boston gallows in 1660 marked the beginning of the end of the Puritan theocracy and New England independence from English rule. In 1661 King Charles II explicitly forbade Massachusetts from executing anyone for professing Quakerism. In 1684 England revoked the Massachusetts charter, sent over a royal governor to enforce English laws in 1686, and in 1689 passed a broad Toleration act.\"[2][3]\nThe settlement of Boston was founded by Puritan chartered colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Colony under John Winthrop, and acquired the name of Boston soon after the arrival of the Winthrop Fleet in 1630. It was named after Boston, Lincolnshire, in England. During the 1640s, as the English Civil War reached its climax, the founder of English Quakerism, George Fox (1624\u20131691), discovered his religious vocation. Under the Puritan English Commonwealth led by Oliver Cromwell, Quakers in England were persecuted, and during the 1650s various groups of Quakers left England as 'Publishers of Truth'.[citation needed]\n",

The cause of death was found to be blunt force trauma from a blow to the head; she had been raped as well.[2]\nThe crime attracted national media attention, as Britton's father was an administrator at Radcliffe College, and several factors led to a presumption that Britton's killer had been an acquaintance, perhaps a fellow student or faculty member of Harvard's anthropology department. Her body had been sprinkled with red ochre powder, used in many ancient funerals of multiple civilizations.[3] No valuables had been taken from the apartment, nor had any of her neighbors heard any screams or other unusual noises (although later some were reported).\nInvestigators were unable to find any likely suspects among the anthropology department. Albert DeSalvo reportedly confessed to raping and murdering another woman who had lived in the same building in 1963, following his arrest as the Boston Strangler several years earlier, but doubts remained as to whether he had committed all the murders linked to the case. Some also considered that there might have been a second Boston Strangler, leading to speculation that, if there was, he might have killed Britton as well. The case went cold but continued to fascinate the media and true crime enthusiasts on the Internet, some of whom brought lawsuits to have records made public from the investigation in the hope of resolving the case.\n",

Indelicato, who served as education advisor to Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis.[5] Deegan grew up in Boston's West End and became what many true crime authors and criminologists, such as Emily Sweeney, describe as a \"career hood\"[4] or \"local gangster\".[6] Edward Deegan's extensive police record goes back to 1948 when he was arrested and charged with larceny.[4] Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Deegan was arrested and charged with break-ins and armed robberies, and in 1959 he was sentenced to six months in the Norfolk County House of Correction.[4] By the 1960s, Deegan had become \"a peripheral figure\" in the Boston underworld,[2] which at the time had become known for its gangsters and competing hoodlum groups.[4]\nA great challenge facing law enforcement in New England during the 1960s was organised gang crime, and one of the FBI's solutions to this was developing criminal informants who would provide the bureau with insider information on criminals and criminal activity.[2] In 1966, Joseph Barboza was persuaded by FBI agent's Paul Rico and Dennis Condon to become a cooperating witness in return for lighter punishment for the crimes he had committed.[2] Barboza's friend, Vincent \"Jimmy the Bear\" Flemmi had also been recruited as an FBI informant, despite having been accused and charged with numerous murders.[2] Barboza was a member of the Patriarca crime family, who in 1965 were committed to killing Edward Deegan as revenge for the robberies he had committed against the family.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Plymouth Mail robbery, or what the press dubbed \"The Great Plymouth Mail Truck Robbery\" was, at the time of its occurrence, the largest cash heist of all time.  On August 14, 1962, two gunmen stopped a U.S. Mail truck that was delivering $1.5 million in small bills from Cape Cod to the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston, Massachusetts.  The hijacking occurred on Route 3 in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  The two robbers, dressed as police officers and brandishing submachine guns, tied up the driver of the truck and the guard and drove the truck themselves to places unknown, where the money was dropped off in several places.  The truck and its two tied-up occupants were abandoned in Randolph, Massachusetts, alongside Route 128.[1][2]\nFor five years the United States Postal Inspection Service as well as the FBI intensively combed New England for leads in the robbery, but were frustrated at the lack of evidence.  Authorities even at one time offered a $150,000 or 10% of the amount recovered (Federal Reserve Bank of Boston) cash reward in addition to the $50,000 Postmaster General reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible for the caper, even going so far as to deem any suspect killed in his apprehension to be deemed \"convicted\" for purposes of the reward.[3]  The combination of media, law enforcement, and popular interest in this record-breaking robbery combined for an atmosphere of near-hysteria in the Boston area throughout the early and middle 1960s.  Not a few completely uninvolved people were accused of being involved in the heist, with the media loudly proclaiming their guilt even with no evidence or facts to support its claims.[4]\nWith the five-year federal statute of limitations approaching with no real leads to solve the robbery, the Postal Inspectorate and the Department of Justice stepped up a campaign of near-total surveillance and harassment of all known armed robbers in the Boston area in a frantic effort to obtain clues about the robber's identities.  Shortly before the statute of limitations was to expire, a federal grand jury indicted four men and one woman as the perpetrators of this robbery.[5]  One of the defendants disappeared right before trial and was never found.[6]  The other defendants were acquitted at trial.\n",

It is known that he lived and worked in Boston, Massachusetts. In November 1805, the body of a young farmer, Marcus Lyon, was found on the open road near town of Wilbraham, Massachusetts. Daly and a fellow Irishman, James Halligan, were traveling in the area at the time, heading for New Haven, Connecticut, when they were arrested for the murder on November 12, 1805, in Northampton, Massachusetts, for which their captor was paid $500. The pair protested their innocence, but were held in prison for nearly five months, being charged with highway robbery from the assault of Lyon. Despite their long confinement, they were granted defense attorneys only 48 hours before their trial. Once the trial for Commonwealth v. Dominic Daley and James Halligan began, they were convicted within minutes, under such flimsy evidence that one of the defense attorneys was led to declare that it was based simply on outright bigotry.\nAt their request, the Rev. Jean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus, the Catholic bishop of Boston, went at great personal risk to assist them in their last moments. He celebrated a Catholic Mass for them in their prison cell. This is believed to have been the first time a Catholic service had taken place in the town.\n",

The murder remains unsolved.\nIn March 1992, the Harvard Law Review published an unfinished draft article by Frug called \"A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto,\"[1] which explored the legal theories on violence toward women. Some members of the Review were opposed to publishing the piece, and later, on the anniversary of her murder, parodied it in He-Manifesto of Post-Mortem Legal Feminism, which was included in the Harvard Law Revue, an annual spoof of the Review. It was signed by \"Mary Doe, Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law\" and argued that Frug's theories were the concoction of paranoid feminists. Co-authors Craig Coben and Ken Fenyo later apologized in a statement, particularly to Frug's husband. They added that they did not mean to distribute the article on the anniversary of her death.[2] The statement was signed by other members of the Review, including the then-Supreme Court editor Paul Clement.[3]  Her views were considered especially infuriating by Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who railed against her audacity, and stirred up strong sentiment against her among his students.[citation needed] According to The New York Times:\n",

He made political enemies during his time at the Central District Court, and later said that \"The Telegram was started to square accounts with those who had been hostile\".  He also crusaded against alcohol, though a rival paper once reported he had  been brought to their offices while drunk.[5]\nThe paper was a success, and he remained editor and owner until he sold the paper to Theodore T.

In 1669, when she was 16 years old, her father committed suicide. His 70-acre estate was valued around 500 pounds and he didn't leave a will. At the time of his death, the Solarts were one of many families involved in land disputes around Salem. The estate was divided mostly between his widow and two sons, with only a small allotment to be shared among seven daughters, however, even this was denied to the girls by their mother's new husband. Sarah was left with no dowry and no prospects beyond marriage to an indentured servant named Daniel Poole who left her heavily in debt when he died soon after.[1]\nThe small portion of land that Sarah had received from her father's estate was lost in a suit filed by Poole's creditors. She and her new husband sold the remainder leaving them impoverished and homeless, and were forced to beg from the households of Salem. It was rumored that she walked off \"muttering\" after Samuel Parris gave her charity, and she developed a reputation for being unpleasant whether she received charity or not. When Samuel and Mary Abbey gave her lodgings for a time they said she was \"so turbulent a spirit, spiteful and so maliciously bent\" that they put her out. Her husband told the examiners that she was \"an enemy to all good\". When accused of never attending church she said it was because she hadn't any proper attire for the services.[2]\n",

In 1967, Tameleo, Raymond L.S. Patriarca, and Jerry Angiulo were charged with the murder of bookmaker Willie Marfeo. Before the trial's conclusion, on March 12, 1965, Tameleo, Peter Limone, Louis Greco, Wilfred Roy French, Ronald Cassesso and Joe Salvati were indicted for the murder of hoodlum Edward \"Teddy\" Deegan. In 1968, all six men were found guilty of the Deegan murder in the Superior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts. Tameleo, Limone, Greco and Cassesso were sentenced to death by the state, with Salvati and French receiving life sentences. The death sentences were later reduced to life in prison, where Tameleo died in 1985.\nBy 2000, Tameleo and the other defendants had been posthumously exonerated amid evidence they had been ensnared in a government frame-up and cover-up extending over thirty years.[2] In 2007, a federal judge in Boston awarded damages of $101.7 million to the families of the four men who were wrongly convicted in the 1965 Deegan murder.  It was proven that Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents H. Paul Rico, Dennis Condon, John Morris, and John Connolly withheld evidence of the defendants' innocence in order to protect FBI informants Vincent \"Jimmy the Bear\" Flemmi and Joseph Barboza. Out of this settlement, $13 million went to the estate of Enrico Tameleo, specifically his son, Saverio, as administrator of the Tameleo estate, and Tameleo's wife Jeanette.[3]\n",

She was part of the last group to be executed, which also included Mary Eastey, Martha Corey, Ann Pudeator, Samuel Wardwell, Mary Parker, Alice Parker, and Wilmot Redd.[1] She was the only accused person from Rowley to be executed. As a lower-class, long-term widow, having lost several children in infancy, she was a prototypical witch candidate. When her husband, Benjamin, died, he left a very small estate and she, being unable to remarry, was reduced to begging, which invited resentment and suspicion. In this manner, her circumstances were comparable to fellow victim Sarah Good.\nMargaret was born in England, March 28, 1616, likely migrating to the colonies with her parents.[citation needed] From the status of her future husband, it is most probable that they were a lower class family.[2] The first record of her in America is her marriage to Benjamin Scott in 1642. They had seven children, though only three survived to adulthood.[note 1] The town of Rowley granted Benjamin land in 1664. Shortly after, he was declared a freeman. A man by the same name (presumably the same man) was fined and \"admonished\" for theft. Benjamin died in 1671, leaving an estate of only 67 pounds and 17 shillings, which would have to support Margaret and her family for the rest of her life, as she never remarried. Consequently, she was reduced to begging.[2]\nMargaret was arrested late in the course of the events, as part of the Andover witch hunt. Mary Walcott and Ann Putnam, Jr. had been brought to Andover on June 11 and again on July 26 to initiate and perpetuate the witch hunt there.[3] Margaret's primary accusers were the two most prominent families in Rowley, the Nelsons and the Wycombs.[2]\n",

Seven years later, they were executed in the electric chair at Charlestown State Prison.\nAfter a few hours' deliberation on July 14, 1921, the jury convicted Sacco and Vanzetti of first-degree murder and they were sentenced to death by the trial judge. Anti-Italianism, anti-immigrant, and anti-anarchist bias were suspected as having heavily influenced the verdict. A series of appeals followed, funded largely by the private Sacco and Vanzetti Defense Committee. The appeals were based on recanted testimony, conflicting ballistics evidence, a prejudicial pretrial statement by the jury foreman, and a confession by an alleged participant in the robbery. All appeals were denied by trial judge Webster Thayer and also later denied by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. By 1926, the case had drawn worldwide attention.

His chief claim to historical significance is that he was the first person to be tried for piracy outside England under Admiralty Law and thus without a jury. These Admiralty courts had been instituted to tackle the rise of piracy in colonial ports where civil and criminal courts had proved ineffective.\nIn July 1703, Governor Joseph Dudley of Boston sent out Captain Daniel Plowman of the Charles with a privateering license to attack French and Spanish ships off the coast of Newfoundland and Arcadia.  John Quelch was Plowman's lieutenant. Before leaving Marblehead, Massachusetts, the Charles's crew under Quartermaster Anthony Holding mutinied and locked the ailing Plowman in his cabin.[1] The crew elected Quelch the captain, who turned the Charles south.  Plowman was thrown overboard, although it was never established whether he was dead or alive at that moment. The crew plundered nine Portuguese ships off the coast of Brazil and gained a large sum of money,[2] even though England and Portugal were at peace at the time.[3] The Charles contained large amounts of Brazilian sugar, hides, cloth, guns, gold dust and coins. The loot's total value is estimated at over \u00a310,000 sterling (\u00a31.69\u00a0million as of 2021).[4] Before their capture, legend says the crew buried some of the gold on Star Island off the coast of New Hampshire. In the 1800s some gold coins were found hidden in a stone wall there.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "\"Rose Tattoo\" is a song by American Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys. It was originally released as the lead single from the band's eighth studio album Signed and Sealed in Blood on November 7, 2012. It was re-recorded with featured vocals from Bruce Springsteen and re-released on May 14, 2013 as part of the Rose Tattoo: For Boston Charity EP, which was released shortly after the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013. A music video for the original version of the song was uploaded on November 8, 2012 to the band's official YouTube channel. The version featuring Springsteen peaked at number 25 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart.\nThe rose tattoo itself appears on Casey's arm and is a memorial to his grandfather, who raised Casey after his father had died.\n\"He taught me most things that make me who I am today,\" Casey says. \"He was a big union guy in Boston. It's in a visible place for me, and I look down and I see it a lot. He was such an inspiring man that it inspires me. Oftentimes, I just catch it out of the corner of my eye and it literally changes my mood when I think of him and what a strong individual he was.\"\n",

Piper (April 22, 1849 \u2013 May 26, 1876), known as The Boston Belfry Murderer, was a Canadian-born American murderer who murdered two underage girls between 1873 and 1875 in Massachusetts and confessed to having done such to one other. He was subsequently hanged for his crimes.\nOriginally from Nova Scotia, Piper was the second-born son of farmer T. C. Piper. Thomas worked as a carpenter on a farm his family owned, before moving with them to Boston in 1866, occasionally working for his father, but aspiring to do better things. Regarded as literate and clever, he had worked at several clerking jobs around the city and was an avid Baptist church-goer, which resulted in him being hired as a sexton for the Warren Avenue Baptist Church. Piper also had some sort of kidney disorder, which he \"treated\" with a secret addiction - using laudanum mixed with alcohol, which caused hallucinations.[1] Unbeknownst to many, he started committing acts of arson before moving on to his first murder.[2]\nOn the night of December 5, 1873, while walking with two of his brothers to the church in Dorchester, Piper suddenly told them that he wasn't feeling well and wanted to go back home. He first went to a place which sold opium and mixed it with alcohol, drinking it all before returning to his house. He then took a saw and sawed off a piece of shaft, before exiting the house, walking around some and hiding under a fence. Soon after, a fire alarm was rung, and when the commotion quieted down, Piper was standing on the street with his brother when he noticed a young woman walking down the street - Bridget Landregan, a domestic servant of good repute who was returning to her mistress' home.[3]\n",

The case deeply shocked the local community, and a $70,000 reward is being offered for evidence leading to an arrest and prosecution.\nCremin was a student of Somerville High School. She did volunteer work at Somerville Cable Access Television, worked with third graders at the Child Development Program at her school, and worked at Star Market.[1]\nOn March 29, 1995, Deanna Cremin followed her usual Wednesday routine of going out with friends and visiting her boyfriend.  Her curfew was 10 pm; when she was not home by midnight, her mother tried unsuccessfully to reach her on her pager. Her boyfriend, considered the last person to see Cremin alive, admits walking her home that night, but says he left her halfway, which, according to Deanna's mother, was unusual, as he had always walked her all the way home prior to that night.[2][3]\n",

All the killer's victims were known sex workers or had struggles with addiction. While the victims were taken from New Bedford, they were all found in different surrounding towns, including Dartmouth, Freetown and Westport, Massachusetts, along Route 140. The main detective that pursued the case was John Dextradeur.[2]\nIn May 1989, Anthony DeGrazia, a 26 year old construction worker\u2019s picture was presented to a locally known New Bedford sex worker in the Weld Square area of New Bedford Massachusetts. One of the sex workers by the name of Margret Medeiros was shown a picture of DeGrazia. Medeiros describes her assailant as having a boxer like build with a flat nose, however, she never identified DeGrazia as a positive suspect, only stating to the detective that he looked like the man who tried to choke her. Medeiros 22 years old then, was brought before a secret grand jury to testify about her attacker. She stated to the grand jury that DeGrazia looked like the man who attacked her and tried to choke her. \nDeGrazia was later picked up for questioning and brought before the secret grand jury but was never indicted. Later, the District Attorney Ronald Pina asked the court judge for a warrant for DeGrazia's arrest accusing him of allegedly 17 attempted rapes and assaults on several other sex workers in the Weld Street area. After DeGrazia was notified about the warrant for his arrest, he and his Defense Attorney, Edward Harrington Esq. of New Bedford (no relation to the presiding Judge on the case) surrendered to the courts. DeGrazia was then arrested, and formally charged with these allegations of 17 rapes and assaults. \n",

It is a variation on the term Livestrong, which was created in 2004. Since the phrase became popular it has been frequently placed on various kinds of signage and merchandise.[1] The use of the term in Boston has led to similar phrases entering public discourse, such as America Strong.\nIn the hours after the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013, the slogan \"Boston Strong\" appeared as a highly popular hashtag on Twitter and rapidly spread around the world. It was a T-shirt campaign created by Christopher Dobens and Nicholas Reynolds, students at Emerson College.  An expression of Boston's unity after the bombing, the slogan showed up on T-shirts and other products, and was emblazoned on the \"Green Monster\" wall at Boston's Fenway Park.[1][2] The Boston Bruins displayed the slogan on their helmets at their game two days after the bombing,[3] and at the first baseball game in Fenway Park after the bombing, the stadium announcer told the crowd: \"We are one. We are strong. We are Boston. We are Boston strong.\"[1]\nOn April 17, two days after the bombing, a T-shirt vendor and another private individual submitted separate trademark registration applications to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, seeking to obtain ownership of the \"Boston Strong\" slogan for use on commercial products.[2] One of the applicants said he wanted the trademark in order to prevent people from outside the Boston area from benefiting from it. A trademark attorney was quoted in The Huffington Post as predicting that the government office would deny the registration on the grounds that the slogan was already in the public domain and could not be linked to any specific entity.[2]\n",

She was a mile away from the finish when the bombs went off. Carlos Arredondo, who was handing out American flags to the runners, quickly jumped over a fence to reach the blast site. The blast-caused fire in Bauman's shirt was beaten out by Arredondo. He stayed with Bauman and helped carry him to the ambulance. The iconic photograph of Carlos Arredondo in a cowboy hat, helping Bauman was taken by Charles Krupa of the Associated Press during this time.[5][6]\n",

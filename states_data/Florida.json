Newspapers misreported the 16-year-old boy as \"35 years of age\". A mob of over 100 men as well as bloodhounds from Mulberry and Pebble was assembled to search for him but a local paper mentioned a possible lynching before any evidence was recovered or he was charged.\nRochelle was captured two days later by two black men, who evaded the mob and turned Rochelle over to the Sheriff of Polk County in Lakeland, Florida. Ten minutes later, Rochelle was turned over to a mob.[3] The mob took Rochelle back to Bartow. A special train was arranged from Lakeland so that a large crowd of spectators could attend a \"barbecue\" in Bartow where Rochelle was to be the \"chief actor.\"[4] He was taken to the site of the Taggart murder, where he was chained to a barrel and doused with quantities of kerosene. At 6:00 p.m. the match was struck. He was burned alive for 15 minutes, and the crowd dispersed by 8:30 that evening.[3][5]\n"

The four attackers,[2] apparently inspired by the film Wonderland,[3] tortured and killed four men, two women, and a dog inside the home, making it the bloodiest mass murder in Volusia County history.[4] Their primary motive for the murders was revenge on Erin Belanger, who had evicted a squatter, Troy Victorino, from her grandmother's then-vacant house, with the secondary motive of recovering an Xbox game console and some clothing that Victorino had left behind. Victorino was able to further motivate his accomplices by pointing out that the attack would likely allow them to kill another person they were mad at, but that person happened not to be at the house that night.[5]\nA jury found Troy Victorino, Robert Cannon, Jerone Hunter, and Michael Salas guilty of the massacre in August 2006. Seventh Circuit Judge William A. Parsons upheld the jury's death penalty recommendation and called the killings \"conscienceless\" and \"unnecessarily torturous.\"[6] He told each of the men during back-to-back sentencing hearings, \"You have not only forfeited your right to live among us, you have forfeited your right to live at all.\" Salas and Cannon were both sentenced to life in prison, while Hunter and Victorino received the death sentence.

Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student David Hogg initiated this boycott after the show's host, Laura Ingraham, ridiculed him amidst conspiracy theories related to the shooting at his school in 2018, in which seventeen students died and where Hogg was a witness and survivor.[1] Ingraham's particular criticism of Hogg was that some universities declined to offer him admission after his college application.[1]\nHogg accused Ingraham of cyberbullying and he suggested that his followers tell her show's sponsors to cancel their advertising purchases.[1] In response, several advertisers left the show after which Ingraham apologized.[1][2] Hogg dismissed the apology as insincere, and he and his supporters continued the pressure campaign on her show's advertisers.[3]\n"

        "paragraph": "\nIn February 2018, a boycott emerged against the U.S. gun rights advocacy group National Rifle Association (NRA) and its business affiliates. The boycott and social media activism campaign arose in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. The NRA was criticized for its response, including its recommendation for schools to arm teachers and opposition to bans on certain weapons. Calls for companies to sever their ties to the NRA resulted in several companies discontinuing their business relationships with the NRA and cancelling discount programs offered to NRA members. The boycott extended to Canada where Mountain Equipment Co-op and the Running Room cut supplier relationships with Vista Outdoor.[1][2] Public pressure also caused a number of gun retailers to increase the age required to buy firearms and place other restrictions on gun sales.\nAfter the Parkland shooting, there was an unprecedented upsurge of public support for gun control advocacy groups[3] and significant backlash against the NRA for its response to the shooting, having argued that schools required more armed security to protect against the possibility of future attacks, and its continued calls to preserving the right to own semi-automatic firearms, such as those used in the shooting.[4][5]\n"

About $80,000 in what was believed to be stolen money was seized by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents during searches in Puerto Rico and Boston.  The  federal government contends that the group spent about $1 million, moved more than $2 million to Cuba, and hid $4 million in safe deposit boxes, certificates of deposit, savings accounts and farmhouse cellars in Puerto Rico.[5]\nThe FBI charges for this robbery include obstruction of commerce by robbery and conspiracy, bank robbery, aggravated robbery, theft from interstate shipment, foreign and interstate transportation of stolen money, and conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery.[6]\n",

In a separate incident, Travis' mother Suzy was fatally shot following an escape in 2001.[10] Sandra and Jerome Herold purchased Travis for $50,000 from a breeder after he was taken from his mother when he was three days old.[3][11] They named the chimpanzee for Sandra's favorite singer, Travis Tritt.[12] The Herolds raised Travis at their home at Rock Rimmon Road in the North Stamford section of Stamford, Connecticut.[13] Travis was the Herolds' constant companion and would often accompany them to work and on their shopping excursions in town.[13] The Herolds owned a towing company, and Travis would pose for photos at the shop and ride with the tow truck, his seatbelt buckled as he wore a baseball shirt.

The angle of the building has a 3-story tower, at the top of which sat the electric telegraph operator.  The two 90-foot (27-meter) wings of the building were occupied by the two railroad companies. The first floor of the station had a large restaurant that was especially important before the development of the dining car. Eventually, both the Central New England and the Housatonic Railroad became a part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The New Haven was later merged into the Penn Central Transportation.[2]\nThe station had been a junction and transfer point for passengers shifting from north-south NYNHH trains (Berkshire Division) to east-west CNE trains (mainline: Campbell Hall to Springfield and Hartford). Passenger service on the CNE line through the station ended in 1927 when the NYNHH acquired the CNE.[3]\n",

The city of New Haven and Yale University have offered a combined $150,000 for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of Jovin's killer.[1] The crime remains unsolved. At Yale, Jovin volunteered as a tutor through the Yale Tutoring in Elementary Schools program, sang in both the Freshman Chorus and the Bach Society Orchestra, co-founded the German Club, and worked for three years in the Davenport dining hall.[2]\nAfter dropping off the penultimate draft of her senior essay on the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden, at approximately 4:15 pm on Friday December 4, 1998, Suzanne Jovin began preparations for a pizza-making party she had organized at the Trinity Lutheran Church on 292 Orange Street for the local chapter of Best Buddies, an international organization that brings together students and mentally disabled adults. By 8:30 pm, after staying late to help clean up, she was driving another volunteer home in a borrowed university station wagon. Around 8:45, she returned the car to the Yale-owned lot on the corner of Edgewood Avenue and Howe Street, and proceeded to walk two blocks to her second-floor apartment at 258 Park Street, upstairs from a Yale police substation.\nSometime prior to 8:50 pm, a few friends passed by Jovin's window and asked her if she wanted to join them at the movies. Jovin declined, stating that she planned to do school work that night. At 9:02, Jovin logged onto her Yale e-mail account and told a female friend in German she was going to leave some GRE books for her in Jovin's apartment building's lobby, once she had retrieved them from an unnamed person who had borrowed them from her. She also provided the access code for her door. This unnamed person has never been identified.[3] Whether Jovin met this unnamed person that night remains unknown. At 9:10, she logged off. If she made or received any calls is unknown; calls within Yale's telephone system were not traceable. She wore the same soft, low-cut hiking boots, jeans, and maroon fleece pullover she had worn at the pizza party.[2]\n",

Her death led to the state of Connecticut's first murder conviction without the victim's body.[1][2]\nHelle Nielsen married Richard Crafts in 1975 and settled with him in Newtown, Connecticut, United States. Helle continued working as a flight attendant while raising their three children. In 1986, Helle began to suspect that Richard was engaged in extramarital sexual activity, and confronted him about suspicious long-distance phone calls, which angered Richard.[3] Helle met with a divorce attorney and hired a private investigator, Keith Mayo, who snapped photos of Richard kissing another flight attendant outside her New Jersey residence.[3]\nOn November 18, 1986, friends dropped Helle off at the couple's Newtown residence after she had worked a long flight from Frankfurt, West Germany. She was never seen again. That night, a snowstorm hit the area. The next morning, Richard said he was taking Helle and their children to his sister's house in Westport. When he arrived, Helle was not with him. Over the next few weeks, Richard gave Helle's friends a variety of stories as to why they were unable to reach her: that she was visiting her mother in Denmark, that she was visiting the Canary Islands with a friend, or that he simply did not know her whereabouts.[4] Helle's friends were aware that Richard had a volatile temper and grew concerned. Helle had told some of them, \"If something happens to me, don't assume it was an accident.\"[5][6] On December 1, the private investigator Keith Mayo reported her missing to the Newtown Police.[3] Richard Crafts was known to local law enforcement for his work as a volunteer police officer in Newtown, and in 1986 Crafts was working as a part-time police officer in the nearby town of Brookfield.[7] According to Mayo, Newtown Police initially dismissed his concerns, saying that Helle would probably return.[3]\n",

The perpetrator, Adam Lanza, fatally shot his mother before murdering 20 students and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and later committed suicide.[1] A number of fringe figures have promoted conspiracy theories that doubt or dispute what occurred at Sandy Hook. Various conspiracy theorists have claimed, for example, that the massacre was actually orchestrated by the U.S. government as part of an elaborate plot to promote stricter gun control laws.[2]\nThe more common conspiracy theory, adopted initially by James H. Fetzer, James Tracy, and others, and further popularized by Alex Jones, denied that the massacre actually occurred, asserting that it was faked. The massacre was described by Fetzer and Tracy as a classified training exercise involving members of federal and local law enforcement, the news media, and crisis actors, which they claim was modeled on Operation Closed Campus, an Iowa school-shooting drill that was canceled in 2011 amid threats and public outcry. Jones described the shooting incident as \"synthetic, completely fake with actors; in my view, manufactured [...] it just shows how bold they are that they clearly used actors.\"[3][4]\nNo evidence supports the conspiracy theories, which make a number of implausible claims.[5][6][7] Moreover, many Sandy Hook conspiracy theories contradict one another.[6] A number of sources have published articles debunking various claims put forward by conspiracy theorists.[6][8][9][10] In 2018, the parents of several children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Jones and other authors of conspiracy videos for defamation, accusing them of engaging in a campaign of \"false, cruel, and dangerous assertions\".[11] In 2019, Jones reversed his stance and stated that the massacre was real.[12]\n",

He was held captive at the New Haven Panther headquarters on Orchard Street, where he was tortured and interrogated until he confessed. His interrogation was tape recorded by the Panthers.[2]  During that time, national party chairman Bobby Seale visited New Haven and spoke on the campus of Yale University for the Yale Black Ensemble Theater Company.[3]  The prosecution alleged, but Seale denied, that after his speech, Seale briefly stopped by the headquarters where Rackley was being held captive and ordered that Rackley be executed.\nEarly in the morning of May 21, three Panthers \u2013 Warren Kimbro, Lonnie McLucas, and George Sams, one of the Panthers who had come East from California to investigate the police infiltration of the New York Panther chapter, drove Rackley to the nearby town of Middlefield, Connecticut.

He called his tenure with New York with the roles of reporter, correspondent and editor, his \"university years\". In 1890 he published \"Representative Sonnets by American Poets\" with an exhaustive essay on the sonnet. Thereafter, he published a number of volumes of his own works from collections previously printed in newspapers and magazines in America. These publications included The Century Magazine, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, The Outlook (New York), Independent, Critic, Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, North American Review, and Outing, along with others.[2] His early collections often had a rural theme and his poems and prose would often involve farming life, as he became a serious farmer.

On December 24, 1983, Karen was reported missing by her parents after she failed to show up at their home for dinner in Bricktown, New Jersey. The next day, her body was found in her apartment on her bedroom floor. She had been stabbed with a knife several times to death. She was also strangled.[3] Karen's ex-boyfriend, Ned Snelgrove, was the prime suspect in her murder, but was not charged until several years later, after attacking another New Jersey woman.

He produced some of the earliest full color newspaper comic strips, and was one of the first producers of regular political cartoons in American daily papers.[1][2] His satirical cartoons, published in outlets such as the New York World and The North American, were influential in the 1884 U.S. presidential election, and soon after political cartoons became a fixture in American papers. He also drew children's comic strips, including Queer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz written by L. Frank Baum, and has been called the first syndicated cartoonist for his contributions to the weekly columns of humorist Bill Nye. His books include The Hidden City (1891) and The Rambillicus Book (1903).\nWalter Hugh McDougall was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of John Alexander McDougall (1810\u20131894),[3] a painter and close associate of writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and Washington Irving.[4] Walt attended a military academy, and from the age of 16 was self-educated. He began his professional work in 1876 with the New York Daily Graphic, which three years earlier had become the nation's first illustrated daily newspaper. He also sold early works to Harper's Weekly and Puck.[5][6] For a time he was part owner of the Newark newspaper The Suburban.[7] He married Mary F. Burns in 1878.[6][8]\nHe began working for the New York World in 1884, and a cartoon printed on August 10 of that year became the World's first political cartoon.[9] Several of his cartoons were influential in the 1884 presidential election. One, likening nominee James G. Blaine's dinner with millionaires and plutocrats shortly before the election to Belshazzar's feast of the Bible, is credited with contributing to Blaine's narrow loss to Grover Cleveland. The cartoon, entitled \"The Royal Feast of Belshazzar Blaine and the Money Kings\" and co-drawn by Valerian Gribayedoff, was reprinted on billboards across New York and Blaine lost the state, and thus the election, by little over 1,000 votes.[10] Author Michael R. Smith writes McDougall and Gribayedoff \"may have created the most influential political cartoon in United States history.\"[11] \"Belshazzar Blaine and the Money Kings\" elevated the prominence of political cartoons, which soon after became a regular feature in daily newspapers nationwide.[12][13][14]\n",

By 8:30 pm, after staying late to help clean up, she was driving another volunteer home in a borrowed university station wagon. Around 8:45, she returned the car to the Yale-owned lot on the corner of Edgewood Avenue and Howe Street, and proceeded to walk two blocks to her second-floor apartment at 258 Park Street, upstairs from a Yale police substation.\nSometime prior to 8:50 pm, a few friends passed by Jovin's window and asked her if she wanted to join them at the movies. Jovin declined, stating that she planned to do school work that night. At 9:02, Jovin logged onto her Yale e-mail account and told a female friend in German she was going to leave some GRE books for her in Jovin's apartment building's lobby, once she had retrieved them from an unnamed person who had borrowed them from her. She also provided the access code for her door. This unnamed person has never been identified.[3] Whether Jovin met this unnamed person that night remains unknown. At 9:10, she logged off. If she made or received any calls is unknown; calls within Yale's telephone system were not traceable. She wore the same soft, low-cut hiking boots, jeans, and maroon fleece pullover she had worn at the pizza party.[2]\n",

He was the oldest of four children, having two younger sisters and a younger brother. The family lived on a chicken farm in Brooklyn, Connecticut. Ross's home life was extremely dysfunctional; his mother, who abandoned the family at least once, had been institutionalized and beat all four of her children, saving the worst treatment for him. Some family and friends have suggested that he was also molested by his teenaged uncle, who committed suicide when Ross was six.[2]\nHe was a bright boy who performed well in school. He graduated from Killingly High School in Killingly, Connecticut, in 1977,[3] and graduated from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he studied economics, in May 1981.[4][5] He became an insurance salesman. He exhibited antisocial behavior from a young age.

Although he was noted for doing well in music and physical education, Johnson had a limited academic ability due to his intellectual disability and also suffered from seizures, which had to be medicated.

She had one child, Alice Beamon (Young), born in 1640,[2] who was also condemned for the same crime thirty years later in the 1670s, but was not hanged.\nAlse Young was born in 1615 in New Windsor, Berkshire, England[1] and moved to Windsor, Connecticut during the 1630s.[1] She is believed to have been the wife of John Young,[3] who bought a small parcel of land in Windsor in 1641, sold it in 1649, and then disappeared from the town records.[4] The best evidence to suggest that John Young was her husband comes from a physician.[5] She had a daughter, Alice Young Beamon, who was accused of witchcraft in nearby Springfield, Massachusetts, some 30 years later.[4] Her daughter Alice Young Beamon married and had children with Simon Beamon.[5] Similarly to her mother, Alice Young Beamon was also accused of witchcraft but defended herself by claiming that she was being slandered.[5] Even though Alice Young was a woman without a son when the witchcraft accusation was lodged, her husband was still alive during her accusation. This makes it unlikely that she was accused simply for the possibility of inheriting her husband's estate in the future. Other reasons are more probable.\nThere is no record of Young's trial or the specifics of the charge. The same year that Alice was hanged the death rate had steadily increased.[5] The influenza affected everyone in that even wealthy people with more resources and access to medical care were dying at extremely high rates.[5] Many prominent members of the noble class and legislature lost their families.[5] Given such circumstances, a member of the elite class may have organized for someone to be hanged and scapegoated, leading to Alice's being chosen at random. She may have been hanged at the Meeting House Square in Hartford, Connecticut, now the site of the Old State House, since a jail was on the edge of the square. A journal of then Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor John Winthrop mentions \"One... of Windsor arraigned and executed at Hartford for a witch.\"[6] The second town clerk of Windsor, Matthew Grant, confirms her execution with the May 26, 1647, diary entry, \"Alse Young was hanged.\" She was roughly 32 years old when she was hanged.\n",

Initially, the 2012 law allowed executions to proceed for those still on death row and convicted under the previous law, but on August 13, 2015, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that applying the death penalty only for past cases was unconstitutional.[1]\nBetween 1639 and 2005, Connecticut performed 126 executions. Twenty-four executions occurred in Connecticut Colony, prior to its statehood. The remaining 102 executions occurred after Connecticut's 1788 admission to the Union as the fifth state.[2] Contrary to popular belief, Adonijah Bailey was not the oldest person ever to be executed in Connecticut, at age 79 in 1824; instead, he was tried and sentenced to death at age 80 in January 1825 for the murder of Jeremiah W. Pollock, and hanged himself on May 24, over two weeks before he was to be executed.[3][4] The oldest person ever to be executed in Connecticut is Gershon Marx, who was hanged for murder at the age of 73, on May 18, 1905.[5]\nAfter Furman v. Georgia, Connecticut reinstated the death penalty on January 10, 1973.[6] Lethal injection became the method mandated to execute condemned prisoners, replacing the electric chair, which had not been used since Taborsky's execution in 1960.[citation needed]\n",

His nicknames came from his ability to pose as a member of the wealthy elite, which allowed him to fool potential victims and avoid scrutiny from investigators. Chapman was the first criminal to be dubbed \"Public Enemy Number One\" by the press.[1]\nGerald Chapman was born George Chartres in August 1887 to parents of Irish heritage.[2] Arrested for the first time in 1902 at age fourteen, Chapman was incarcerated for most of his early adult life.[3] While serving time for bank robbery, he was transferred from Sing Sing to Auburn State Prison, and became acquainted with highly educated Danish-born con man George \"Dutch\" Anderson in 1908.[4] With Anderson as his mentor, Chapman became a voracious reader and a self-styled gentleman, often affecting a British accent. Following both men's paroles in 1919, they began bootlegging operations in Toledo, Miami and New York City over the next two years.\nIn late 1921, along with former Auburn inmate Charles Loeber, Chapman and Anderson began committing armed robberies. On October 24,[5] the three men forced a U.S. Mail truck to stop at gunpoint on Leonard Street, successfully taking $2.4 million in cash, bonds and jewelry. Their identities were unknown to the police for months, and Chapman lived the life of an aristocrat, residing with his mistress in New York's fashionable Gramercy Park neighborhood. The three men were eventually arrested by United States Postal Inspectors William Doran, Jim Doyle and William Cochraine on July 3, 1922, after Chapman attempted to sell Argentine gold notes (stolen during the Leonard Street mail robbery) to an undercover postal inspector posing as a stock broker.[6] Chapman made headlines when he briefly got away from his interrogators at police headquarters, but he was caught before he could leave the building.\n",

Yale, 631 F.2d 178 (2d Cir. 1980),[1] was the first use of Title IX[2] of the United States Education Amendments of 1972 in charges of sexual harassment against an educational institution.[3]  It further established that sexual harassment of female students could be considered sex discrimination, and was thus illegal.\nThe plaintiffs were Ronni Alexander, Margery Reifler, Pamela Price, Lisa E. Stone and Ann Olivarius. All were Yale College students between 1973 and 1980.\nAlexander and Reifler alleged that they were sexually harassed and/or assaulted by a flute teacher (Keith Brion) and hockey coach,[4] respectively, and that Yale provided no procedure through which they could complain. Pamela Price alleged a classic case of what is now known as quid pro quo sexual harassment, when a course instructor offered to give her an \u2018A\u2019 if she complied with his sexual demands.[5] Lisa Stone alleged that English professor Michael Cooke propositioned her during his office hours while putting his hand on her knee. Ann Olivarius alleged that the absence of a procedure for complaining about sexual harassment forced her to expend her own time and money on helping fellow students who had been sexually harassed, and that in the course of providing that help she was threatened by individuals whom she was investigating, and that Yale failed to protect her from those individuals.\n",

He is the founder of the HONR Network, which supports the victims of mass casualty violence as well as the targets of online hate speech and harassment.\nOn December 14, 2012, 20 year old Adam Lanza took a Bushmaster XM-15 semi-automatic rifle into Sandy Hook Elementary school and killed 20 children and 6 teachers. One of the children killed was Pozner's six-year-old son Noah.[1] Shortly afterwards, conspiracy theorists used Facebook, YouTube, blogs and other social media platforms to claim the massacre was a hoax and a false flag operation and that the victims were actually crisis actors. Among them was radio-show host Alex Jones, who repeatedly used the conspiracy theory to tell the audience listening to his InfoWars radio program to rise up and \"find out the truth\", insisting that the shooting was staged by the federal government to destroy the Second Amendment and citizens' right to bear arms.[1]\nWhile mourning the loss of their children, Pozner and the other victims' families had to endure accusations that their children were not dead, and that the tragedy was a fraud designed to undermine Americans' gun rights.[2] They received death threats and in-person, online and phone call harassment from people who took up the call from Jones and others. In response, Pozner began reporting harassing and defaming content and claims about him and his family, as well as posts and videos using photos (often defaced) of his son.[3] \"I have to absolutely defend the memory of my son \u2014 I have no choice\" he said. \"I know how some of these theories build up. They don't fade away and the more time they spend online, the more accepted they become. The JFK conspiracy theory in the US is very accepted. Conspiracy theories erase history, they erase our memories, and how will this event (Sandy Hook) be remembered a hundred years from now?

Investigators later theorized that one of the victims had recognized Schrager during the robbery, and the perpetrators thus felt the need to eliminate all witnesses. Michael P. Kron, age 49, one of the victims, was related to Schrager as his uncle by marriage. Schrager felt that Kron had recognized him and would be able to identify him.\n",

In addition, he usually could not bring himself to actually make trades, causing trouble for him with the brokerage firms he worked for.  After being fired by his boss John Schulte in 1986, Schulte's wife and brokerage partner, Sonia, left the marriage to join Frankel as his business and life partner.[7] Frankel set up Winthrop Capital using the phony name of James Spencer.

Racial tensions were high in the Groton and New London area from May to June, and there were several confrontations between the two groups. Black sailors reported that white sailors attacked them, and white Marines accused the black sailors of waiting for them after dark when they crossed Long Cove Bridge.[1] The police arrested two white \"Blue Jackets\", and white sailors attacked the Hotel Bristol on Bank Street where the black sailors spent most of their free time, throwing a group of blacks out of the hotel on the street and beating them. The police and fire brigades were called but could not stop the rioting. The Marine Corps were eventually called, and they regained control.[1]\nOn May 30, 1919, about 20 sailors and soldiers were arrested by police officers, marines, and firemen. The Greeneville Daily Sun reported that the trouble began when \"negro sailors\" entered the Coast Guard Academy in New London and attacked white sailors.[2] On June 29, 1919, another riot erupted which required the Marines to restore order.[3] Author Jan Voogd argues that this riot came to national attention because a fire hydrant was damaged by the marine vehicles. This caused a dispute between the submarine base and city authorities over who would pay for the damage, and so created a paper trail.[3] Voogd posits that there may have been other race riots that went \"uncounted, unobserved, and unacknowledged.\"[3]\n",

Fetzer, James Tracy, and others, and further popularized by Alex Jones, denied that the massacre actually occurred, asserting that it was faked. The massacre was described by Fetzer and Tracy as a classified training exercise involving members of federal and local law enforcement, the news media, and crisis actors, which they claim was modeled on Operation Closed Campus, an Iowa school-shooting drill that was canceled in 2011 amid threats and public outcry. Jones described the shooting incident as \"synthetic, completely fake with actors; in my view, manufactured [...] it just shows how bold they are that they clearly used actors.\"[3][4]\nNo evidence supports the conspiracy theories, which make a number of implausible claims.[5][6][7] Moreover, many Sandy Hook conspiracy theories contradict one another.[6] A number of sources have published articles debunking various claims put forward by conspiracy theorists.[6][8][9][10] In 2018, the parents of several children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Jones and other authors of conspiracy videos for defamation, accusing them of engaging in a campaign of \"false, cruel, and dangerous assertions\".[11] In 2019, Jones reversed his stance and stated that the massacre was real.[12]\n",

It was the deadliest primary school shooting,[2] the fourth-deadliest mass shooting by a single person,[3] and one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history.[4]\nWithin hours of the shooting, a We the People user started a petition asking the White House to \"immediately address the issue of gun control through the introduction of legislation in Congress,\"[5][6] and the gun control advocacy group the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence reported that an avalanche of donations caused its website to crash.[7] That afternoon, President Barack Obama made a televised statement offering condolences on behalf of the nation to Connecticut governor, Dannel Malloy and saying, \"we're going to have to come together and take meaningful action to prevent more tragedies like this, regardless of the politics.\"[8] Speaking at a December 16 memorial service in Newtown, Obama said he would \"use whatever power this office holds\" to prevent similar tragedies.[9] By December 17, the White House petition had more than 150,000 signatures,[6] and one week after the shooting it had almost 200,000, along with those on 30 similar petitions.[10]\n",

Her death led to the state of Connecticut's first murder conviction without the victim's body.[1][2]\nHelle Nielsen married Richard Crafts in 1975 and settled with him in Newtown, Connecticut, United States. Helle continued working as a flight attendant while raising their three children. In 1986, Helle began to suspect that Richard was engaged in extramarital sexual activity, and confronted him about suspicious long-distance phone calls, which angered Richard.[3] Helle met with a divorce attorney and hired a private investigator, Keith Mayo, who snapped photos of Richard kissing another flight attendant outside her New Jersey residence.[3]\nOn November 18, 1986, friends dropped Helle off at the couple's Newtown residence after she had worked a long flight from Frankfurt, West Germany. She was never seen again. That night, a snowstorm hit the area. The next morning, Richard said he was taking Helle and their children to his sister's house in Westport. When he arrived, Helle was not with him. Over the next few weeks, Richard gave Helle's friends a variety of stories as to why they were unable to reach her: that she was visiting her mother in Denmark, that she was visiting the Canary Islands with a friend, or that he simply did not know her whereabouts.[4] Helle's friends were aware that Richard had a volatile temper and grew concerned. Helle had told some of them, \"If something happens to me, don't assume it was an accident.\"[5][6] On December 1, the private investigator Keith Mayo reported her missing to the Newtown Police.[3] Richard Crafts was known to local law enforcement for his work as a volunteer police officer in Newtown, and in 1986 Crafts was working as a part-time police officer in the nearby town of Brookfield.[7] According to Mayo, Newtown Police initially dismissed his concerns, saying that Helle would probably return.[3]\n",

Mrs. Dick filed for divorce in April 1932, and stated in her suit that the couple had been separated for a year.  The divorce was concluded within a day, and she received custody of the child.[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJasper Tyrone \"Jazz\" Howard (January 28, 1989 \u2013 October 18, 2009) was an American football cornerback for the University of Connecticut Huskies from 2007 to 2009. He was fatally stabbed on October 18, 2009, hours after UConn's win over the Louisville Cardinals.\nHoward grew up in the Little Haiti neighborhood of Miami, an area known for its poverty and violence. His mother JoAngila Howard worked numerous jobs to support Howard and his two younger sisters.[1]\nHis youngest sister had health issues after a severe case of meningitis.[2] His plan was to get a football scholarship and go to the NFL to get money and get his family out of the violent streets of Miami.  At Miami Edison High School, Howard was an All-Dade County pick as a senior, and named MVP of the annual Nike Dade-Broward All-Star Game after returning a punt 70 yards for a touchdown and making a 45-yard touchdown catch.  He was also the team captain.[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "Harry Thurston Peck (November 24, 1856 \u2013 March 23, 1914) was an American classical scholar, author, editor, historian and critic.\nPeck was born in Stamford, Connecticut. He was educated in private schools and at Columbia College, graduating in 1881, where his literary gifts attracted wide attention. His address at the conclusion of that year's commencement exercises was \"witty, pathetic, and full of clever allusions\" according to the New York Times. \"Bouquets fell at his feet by the score as he bowed his way off the stage.\"[1] Upon graduation, he immediately joined the faculty as a Latin tutor, becoming a professor in 1888.[2] He was among several faculty members appointed to newly created chairs when he became Anthon Professor of Latin Language and Literature at the celebration of the 150th anniversary of Columbia's founding in 1904.[3]\nPeck also wrote travel guides and produced translations and works for children under a number of pseudonyms, and he was a frequent and forceful contributor to magazines and newspapers. He was editor in chief of Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities and editor of the Students' Series of Latin Classics and Columbia University Studies in Classical Philology. He served as the first editor in chief of The Bookman magazine, worked on its staff from 1895 to 1906, and created America's first best-seller list for its pages in 1895. He was also editor in chief of the International Cyclopaedia from 1890 to 1901 and co-editor of the first edition of the New International Encyclopedia (1902\u20131904).  In 1906 he published a nearly 800-page monument of progressive historiography, Twenty Years of the Republic 1885-1905, expansive, dense with detail and reference, penetrating, scathing in its revelations of actual social, economic and political conditions.  It was excoriated in the metropolitan press and plainly had much to do with his later difficulties.\n",

Authorities suspect that she was killed in a violent attack at her home in New Canaan, Connecticut. Her husband, Fotis Dulos, and his girlfriend, Michelle Troconis, were arrested on charges of tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution in connection with Jennifer's disappearance. Later, the two \u2013 along with Fotis' attorney Kent Mawhinney \u2013 faced additional charges related to Jennifer's murder. Fotis died by suicide in January 2020. As of June\u00a02022[update], neither Troconis nor Mawhinney have had their day in court, so none of the accused have yet been proven guilty.[1]\nJennifer and Fotis were in the midst of both a contentious divorce and child-custody proceedings.[2] Police suspect that Fotis had been lying in wait for Jennifer and attacked her when she arrived at her home, after dropping her children off at school. Police allege that he and Troconis drove to Hartford to dispose of garbage bags containing items with Jennifer's blood on them on the night that Jennifer disappeared. Police further allege that Mawhinney conspired with Fotis and Troconis. If convicted, they will spend life behind bars.\n",

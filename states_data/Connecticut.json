It was built in 1872 at the junction of the Housatonic Railroad and the Connecticut Western Railroad which was acquired by the Central New England Railway.[2]\nThe station was located at the level junction between the two rail lines, making an almost right angle at 85 degrees right at the crossover.  The angle of the building has a 3-story tower, at the top of which sat the electric telegraph operator.  The two 90-foot (27-meter) wings of the building were occupied by the two railroad companies. The first floor of the station had a large restaurant that was especially important before the development of the dining car. Eventually, both the Central New England and the Housatonic Railroad became a part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The New Haven was later merged into the Penn Central Transportation.[2]\n"

At least sixteen people, including one child, were killed during the course of the feud, and many others were seriously injured.[1] The feud took place primarily in the border areas of Hawkins County (formerly part of Sullivan County, North Carolina, one of the earliest Tennessee counties and said to have a large Melungeon population), Washington County, Claiborne County, Hancock County, Tennessee (created when Hawkins County, Tennessee was subdivided), and Lee County, Virginia, not far from Cumberland Gap, the narrow Appalachian Mountain pass sometimes called The Wilderness Road leading into Kentucky.\nMost of the history of this feud is found in family records, particularly in a self-published small-edition book by Alton Lee Greene, a genealogist who lived in Sanger, Texas. Alton Lee Greene (a 20th-century descendant of the feuding families) traced the genealogy of the descendants of American colonist Judge William Greene, a judge in the Court of Common Pleas who was born in Lincolnshire, England in 1671 and died in 1722 in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.[2] Judge Greene married Joanna \"Hannah\" Reeder, the daughter of John Reeder and Joanna  Burroughs Reeder, who was born in 1699 in Newtown, Long Island, New York.  Judge William Greene and Hannah settled in the area of Ewing, New Jersey and built the William Green House (Ewing Township, New Jersey), now on the National Historic Register and located on the campus of The College of New Jersey. Despite fund-raising efforts, the old farmhouse near where the troops of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River once rested during the Revolutionary War, has never been fully restored.[3]\n"

        "paragraph": "The Louisville riots of 1968 refers to riots in Louisville, Kentucky in May 1968. As in many other cities around the country, there were unrest and riots partially in response to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., on April 4. On May 27, a group of 400 people, mostly blacks, gathered at 28th and Greenwood Streets, in the Parkland neighborhood. The intersection, and Parkland in general, had recently become an important location for Louisville's black community, as the local NAACP branch had moved its office there.\nThe crowd was protesting against the possible reinstatement of a white officer who had been suspended for beating a black man some weeks earlier. Several community leaders arrived and told the crowd that no decision had been reached, and alluded to disturbances in the future if the officer was reinstated. By 8:30, the crowd began to disperse.\n"

Officials believe that the women were likely hitchhiking or may have engaged in sex work.[3][7]\n"

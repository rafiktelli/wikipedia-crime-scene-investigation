This led to speculation that all killings were the work of a single serial killer, who was nicknamed \"The Great Basin Killer\".[2] This assertion has since been disregarded, as over the years it has been established that multiple unrelated serial killers operated in the area and that a majority of the killings were committed by different perpetrators.[3]\n"

He was released from custody in 2013 after his third trial resulted in an acquittal.

Camm told police that he returned home from playing basketball at a nearby church and found his wife shot to death on the garage floor. He then saw his daughter, Jill, sitting upright in the backseat, still strapped in her seatbelt. Brad was draped over the driver's side of the backseat as though he had been trying to get away from the assailant. Since both Kim and Jill had been shot through the head, Camm stated that he thought his son, who had no head injuries, might still be alive, so he entered the passenger front of the Bronco, went through the two front bucket seats and grabbed his son, taking him out, putting him on the garage floor, and giving him CPR.[2] In the process, Camm had placed his left knee in the middle of the back seat, causing Jill's head and body to slump forward and to the left, contacting Camm's T-shirt. Bradley Camm was found lying on the garage floor and a later autopsy found he had been shot through his torso, severing his spine. \n"

Stewart Holbrook says that Doty \"was, before the James-Younger era, the most energetic and notorious all-around bandit in the United States.\"[1] Doty's criminal career is known primarily through his autobiography, compiled by J. G. W. Colburn and published four years after Doty's death as The Life of Sile Doty The Most Noted Thief and Daring Burglar of His Time. [2] As this title suggests, the tone of the autobiography is boastful and unapologetic. Doty excuses his crimes as stealing from the rich to give to the poor. Except where otherwise noted, what follows is taken from the autobiography and may contain exaggerations and self-serving distortions.\nDoty was born Silas Doty in St. Albans, Vermont. His parents were David Doty (1778\u20131855) and Martha Wilson (1781\u20131875). Silas was a fourth great grandson of Mayflower passenger Edward Doty (c.\u20091599\u20131655) and Faith Clarke (1619\u20131675).[3] As a child, he stole toys from his siblings, a pen knife from his teacher, and a horseshoe from a blacksmith, not because he needed or wanted these things, but for the excitement and pleasure he took from evading detection. When Doty was about nine years old, his family moved west to Bangor, New York, a fur trapping region, where he began a lucrative three-year career of stealing animals from traps and selling their furs. Circa 1815, Doty joined a band of thieves and counterfeiters operating in the Bangor area. In a few years, Doty became the leader of this gang, whose depredations now extended throughout New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.\nIn the winter of 1818, Doty learned blacksmithing and used his new skills to outfit himself with a complete set of skeleton keys and burglary tools. Throughout his criminal career, Doty specialized in making such tools and employing them with great stealth and skill. Doty typically employed disguises, false identities, misdirection, and other nonviolent means, but when directly challenged he would resort to brass knuckles or whatever was at hand. Doty learned to pass counterfeit money from Ed Cooper, a resident of New York City, who would wholesale such money to him for 30 cents on the dollar.\n"

The tribal band was living in an encampment along Deer Lick Creek, near the falls at Fall Creek, the site of present-day Pendleton, Indiana. The incident sparked national attention as details of the massacre and trial were reported in newspapers of the day. It was the first documented case in which white Americans were convicted, sentenced to capital punishment, and executed for the murder of Native Americans under U.S. law. Of the seven white men who participated in the crime, six were captured. The other white man, Thomas Harper, was never apprehended. Four of the men were charged with murder and the other two testified for the prosecution. The  four accused men were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. James Hudson was hanged on January 12, 1825, in Madison County, and Andrew Sawyer and John Bridge Sr. were hanged on June 3, 1825. James B. Ray, the governor of Indiana, pardoned John Bridge Jr., the eighteen-year-old son of John Bridge Sr., due to his age and the influence the others may have had on his involvement in the murders.\nFew details about the victims are known. The white men knew the Native American men only as Ludlow and Logan. The names of the remaining victims were not recorded. It is possible that the band had a mixed tribal background of Seneca, Shawnee, and Delaware, which was not unusual in the tribes of the region. John Johnson, a federal Indian agent, identified them as a band of Seneca who had come to the area as part of their winter migration from their home base near Lewis Town, Ohio.\nIn spite of the case's notoriety and the convictions of the white perpetrators, the massacre did not set a lasting precedent for equal justice under American law. A stone marker in Pendleton's Fall Creek Park commemorates the site of the hangings. A state historical marker along State Road 38 in rural Madison County, close to present-day Markleville, Indiana, identifies the nearby site of the murders. The events also served as the inspiration for The Massacre at Fall Creek, a novel by Jessamyn West, which was published in 1975.\n"

Most of the stolen money was never recovered.\nThe gang was broken up by the lynchings of ten of its members by vigilante mobs in 1868. The murders created an international diplomatic incident with Canada and Great Britain, a general public uproar, and international newspaper coverage. No one was ever identified or prosecuted for the lynchings.\nThe Reno Brothers have been portrayed in at least three films, including Elvis Presley's film debut in Love Me Tender (1956), in which he starred as Clint Reno, and Rage at Dawn (1955), featuring Randolph Scott.\n"

After some time, the couple married, with Greenwell\u2014who had adopted a daughter from a previous marriage\u2014fathering a son of his own.[4] In 1982, Greenwell was once again arrested and sentenced to prison for a burglary in Iowa. During his arrest, Greenwell escaped from custody and was recaptured twice. He served in the Anamosa State Penitentiary and Kentucky State Reformatory until his release in 1983.[3] At some point, Greenwell found employment as a railroad worker, and worked on tracks across the Midwest.[5]\n"

        "paragraph": "The Indiana Klan was a branch of the Ku Klux Klan, a secret society in the United States that organized in 1915 to promote ideas of racial superiority and affect public affairs on issues of Prohibition, education, political corruption, and morality. It was strongly white supremacist against African Americans, Chinese Americans, and also Catholics and Jews, whose faiths were commonly associated with Irish, Italian, Balkan, and Slavic immigrants and their descendants. In Indiana, the Klan did not tend to practice overt violence but used intimidation in certain cases, whereas nationally the organization practiced illegal acts against minority ethnic and religious groups.\nThe Indiana Klan rose to prominence beginning in the early 1920s after World War I, when white Protestants felt threatened by social and political issues, including changes caused by decades of heavy immigration from southern and eastern Europe. By 1922 the state had the largest organization nationally, and its membership continued to increase dramatically under the leadership of D.C. Stephenson. It averaged 2,000 new members per week from July 1922 to July 1923, when he was appointed as the Grand Dragon of Indiana. He led the Indiana Klan and other chapters he supervised to break away from the national organization in late 1923.\nIndiana's Klan organization reached its peak of power in the following years, when it had 250,000 members, an estimated 30% of native-born white men. By 1925 over half the elected members of the Indiana General Assembly, the Governor of Indiana, and many other high-ranking officials in local and state government were members of the Klan. Politicians had also learned they needed Klan endorsement to win office.\n"

In modern times, they are often viewed as engaging in terrorism. They became common in the state following the American Civil War and lasted until the turn of the 20th century. White caps were  especially active in  Crawford and neighboring counties in the late 1880s. Several members of the Reno Gang  were lynched in 1868, causing an international incident. Some of the members had been extradited to the United States from Canada and were supposed to be under federal protection. Lynchings continued against other criminals, but when two possibly innocent men were killed in Corydon in 1889,[1] Indiana responded by cracking down on the white cap vigilante groups, beginning in the administration of Isaac P. Gray.\nGovernor of Indiana James A. Mount belonged to one of the white cap groups, and reversed state policy of trying to stop the groups. His successor, Winfield T. Durbin, resumed the policy in 1900, two years after the Indiana General Assembly passed a strong anti-lynching law. When a lynching occurred in Vincennes in 1902 Durbin removed several law enforcement personnel from their positions, to show that he expected locals to cooperate in stopping the lynching.  His plan worked, and when a lynching was threatened in the following year local police notified Durbin who called out the state militia to guard the jailhouse. When the white cap groups attacked the jailhouse, the militia opened fire; killing one and wounding at least eleven.\nThe show of force effectively brought an end to vigilante lynching in Indiana. Only two recorded lynchings have occurred since then, the 1930 murders of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith. Lynching in Indiana was not explicitly racial, but tended to occur against anyone suspected of murder. Between 1860 and 1910, at least 68 people were lynched; twenty were blacks and forty-eight were whites.\n"

Speedway authorities called on explosive experts from the Indiana State Police, the Marion County Sheriff's Department, the 64th Ordnance from nearby Fort Benjamin Harrison and specialists from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). They formed a 100-strong task force to solve the case. The devices were simple homemade bombs constructed from soda cans packed with Tovex 200 and triggered with a rudimentary timing device. The following Saturday, two more blasts hit Speedway, with another the day after at the local bowling alley. The next day, a device exploded under the car of an off-duty Speedway police officer, who was on sick leave at the time and was not injured.[1]\nThe last bombing took place on September 6, when another explosive device concealed in a gym bag detonated in the parking lot of Speedway High School shortly after a freshman football game.[2] Injuries sustained in the explosion forced the amputation of Vietnam War veteran Carl DeLong's right leg.[2] DeLong had spotted the bag and proceeded to kick it before removing it, causing the bomb to explode. Aside from severing his right leg, the explosion also severely injured DeLong's left leg and right hand as well as severing an artery in his wife Sandra's leg.[3][4]\n"

Both men remain, to this day, the prime suspects in the November 1924 murder of Dean O'Banion, boss of Chicago's North Side Gang.\nSoon after O'Banion's murder, Scalise and Anselmi secretly defected from the Gennas to Al Capone's Chicago Outfit. On June 13, 1925, Anselmi and Scalise, along with Mike Genna, ambushed North Siders George \"Bugs\" Moran and Vincent \"The Schemer\" Drucci in The Patch, shooting up their car with shotguns and wounding Drucci. About an hour later, as the shooters raced south on Western Avenue, they were sighted and pursued by a detective squad. After a high-speed chase, the gangsters were overtaken at the corner of Western and 60th Street. Immediately after the cars screeched to a stop, the gangsters jumped out and opened fire with their shotguns. During the ensuing gun battle, Chicago Police officers Harold Olsen and Charles Walsh were killed and Michael Conway severely wounded. The fourth officer, William Sweeney, pursued the fleeing Anselmi, Scalise, and Genna towards the next block of houses. Genna was fatally shot by Sweeney while the other two were captured after boarding a nearby streetcar. It was later said that when they were initially spotted by the detectives, Scalise and Anselmi were speeding south towards Chicago city limits in order to discreetly murder Mike Genna, who had allegedly been marked for death by the pair's secret employer, Al Capone.\n"

The tribal band was living in an encampment along Deer Lick Creek, near the falls at Fall Creek, the site of present-day Pendleton, Indiana. The incident sparked national attention as details of the massacre and trial were reported in newspapers of the day. It was the first documented case in which white Americans were convicted, sentenced to capital punishment, and executed for the murder of Native Americans under U.S. law. Of the seven white men who participated in the crime, six were captured. The other white man, Thomas Harper, was never apprehended. Four of the men were charged with murder and the other two testified for the prosecution. The  four accused men were convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. James Hudson was hanged on January 12, 1825, in Madison County, and Andrew Sawyer and John Bridge Sr. were hanged on June 3, 1825. James B. Ray, the governor of Indiana, pardoned John Bridge Jr., the eighteen-year-old son of John Bridge Sr., due to his age and the influence the others may have had on his involvement in the murders.\nFew details about the victims are known. The white men knew the Native American men only as Ludlow and Logan. The names of the remaining victims were not recorded. It is possible that the band had a mixed tribal background of Seneca, Shawnee, and Delaware, which was not unusual in the tribes of the region. John Johnson, a federal Indian agent, identified them as a band of Seneca who had come to the area as part of their winter migration from their home base near Lewis Town, Ohio.\nIn spite of the case's notoriety and the convictions of the white perpetrators, the massacre did not set a lasting precedent for equal justice under American law. A stone marker in Pendleton's Fall Creek Park commemorates the site of the hangings. A state historical marker along State Road 38 in rural Madison County, close to present-day Markleville, Indiana, identifies the nearby site of the murders. The events also served as the inspiration for The Massacre at Fall Creek, a novel by Jessamyn West, which was published in 1975.\n"

The incident attracted international attention due to both the brutality of the murder and the young age of the perpetrators, who were aged between 15 and 17 years old. The case was covered on national news and talk shows and has inspired a number of episodes on fictional crime shows.[1]\nShanda Sharer was born in the Pineville Community Hospital in Pineville, Kentucky, on June 6, 1979, to Stephen Sharer and his wife Jacqueline, who was later known as Jacqueline Vaught.[2] After Sharer's parents divorced, her mother remarried and the family moved to Louisville. There, Sharer attended fifth and sixth grades at St. Paul School, where she was on the cheerleading, volleyball, and softball teams.[3] When her mother divorced again, the family moved in June 1991 to New Albany, Indiana, and Sharer enrolled at Hazelwood Middle School.[4] Early in the school year, she transferred to Our Lady of Perpetual Help School, a Catholic school in New Albany, where she joined the girls' basketball team.[3]\n"

However, Oberholtzer regained consciousness long enough to give a signed statement to police.[2] She described Stephenson's assaults which led to his conviction at trial and led to the rapid decline of KKK membership in Indiana.\nBorn to German-American parents, Madge Oberholtzer grew up in Indianapolis, where her father worked as a postal clerk and her family belonged to the Irvington Methodist Church.[3] Oberholtzer studied English, mathematics, zoology and logic at Butler College in Irvington, but she dropped out at the end of her junior year without saying why. Through her life, she lived with her parents in Irvington.[3] By the time she met Stephenson, Oberholtzer was the manager of the Indiana Young People's Reading Circle, a special section of the Indiana Department of Public Instruction. However, she heard rumors that her job and the Reading Circle program were about to be eliminated due to budget cuts.[3]\n"

Both men remain, to this day, the prime suspects in the November 1924 murder of Dean O'Banion, boss of Chicago's North Side Gang.\nSoon after O'Banion's murder, Scalise and Anselmi secretly defected from the Gennas to Al Capone's Chicago Outfit. On June 13, 1925, Anselmi and Scalise, along with Mike Genna, ambushed North Siders George \"Bugs\" Moran and Vincent \"The Schemer\" Drucci in The Patch, shooting up their car with shotguns and wounding Drucci. About an hour later, as the shooters raced south on Western Avenue, they were sighted and pursued by a detective squad. After a high-speed chase, the gangsters were overtaken at the corner of Western and 60th Street. Immediately after the cars screeched to a stop, the gangsters jumped out and opened fire with their shotguns. During the ensuing gun battle, Chicago Police officers Harold Olsen and Charles Walsh were killed and Michael Conway severely wounded. The fourth officer, William Sweeney, pursued the fleeing Anselmi, Scalise, and Genna towards the next block of houses. Genna was fatally shot by Sweeney while the other two were captured after boarding a nearby streetcar. It was later said that when they were initially spotted by the detectives, Scalise and Anselmi were speeding south towards Chicago city limits in order to discreetly murder Mike Genna, who had allegedly been marked for death by the pair's secret employer, Al Capone.\n"

He also learned to play the piano, occasionally performing professionally.[3] By his teens, Blackwell was a part-time musician, traveling as far as Chicago.[3] He was known for being withdrawn and hard to work with, but he established a rapport with the pianist Leroy Carr, whom he met in Indianapolis in the mid-1920s, and they had a productive working relationship.[3] Carr convinced Blackwell to record with him for Vocalion Records in 1928;[7] the result was \"How Long, How Long Blues\", the biggest blues hit of that year.\nBlackwell also made solo recordings for Vocalion, including \"Kokomo Blues\", which was transformed into \"Old Kokomo Blues\" by Kokomo Arnold and later reworked as \"Sweet Home Chicago\" by Robert Johnson.

In the 1910 census there were 2.3 million German-born immigrants living in the United States and 550 German newspapers in the country.[2] The large number of German-Americans was also a factor in keeping America out of World War I until the fighting had been going on for three years.[3]\nEdmund Kayser was born in Bavaria.[4] He moved to the United States and established an independent Lutheran church that paid him $50 ($1,245 in 2023) a month. It was said that he had other sources of income buying and selling land.[5]\n"

His nickname derives from the fact that several of the stores in which his victims worked were located a few miles off of Interstate 70 (I-70).\nHis victims were usually young, petite, brunette women. One of the victims was a man, but it is believed that the killer may have expected a woman in the store due to the store having a woman's name. All of the stores attacked were specialty stores and were usually only robbed of small amounts of cash.[1] He is also suspected of shooting three more store clerks in Texas during 1993 and 1994, one of whom survived, as well as a 2001 murder of a store clerk in Terre Haute, Indiana.\n"

Both men remain, to this day, the prime suspects in the November 1924 murder of Dean O'Banion, boss of Chicago's North Side Gang.\nSoon after O'Banion's murder, Scalise and Anselmi secretly defected from the Gennas to Al Capone's Chicago Outfit. On June 13, 1925, Anselmi and Scalise, along with Mike Genna, ambushed North Siders George \"Bugs\" Moran and Vincent \"The Schemer\" Drucci in The Patch, shooting up their car with shotguns and wounding Drucci. About an hour later, as the shooters raced south on Western Avenue, they were sighted and pursued by a detective squad. After a high-speed chase, the gangsters were overtaken at the corner of Western and 60th Street. Immediately after the cars screeched to a stop, the gangsters jumped out and opened fire with their shotguns. During the ensuing gun battle, Chicago Police officers Harold Olsen and Charles Walsh were killed and Michael Conway severely wounded. The fourth officer, William Sweeney, pursued the fleeing Anselmi, Scalise, and Genna towards the next block of houses. Genna was fatally shot by Sweeney while the other two were captured after boarding a nearby streetcar. It was later said that when they were initially spotted by the detectives, Scalise and Anselmi were speeding south towards Chicago city limits in order to discreetly murder Mike Genna, who had allegedly been marked for death by the pair's secret employer, Al Capone.\n"

When he was two years old, the family moved out of state and settled in New Albany, Indiana, where Gibson grew up. In later interviews, he claimed that he had never experienced any abuse or neglect from either of his parents. He said he was even spoiled but acknowledged that his father was an alcoholic who would become combative when drunk.[1]\nFrom an early age, Gibson displayed odd behavior, having trouble speaking to others, struggling at school, and preferring to stay home with his mother. Whenever he went to school, Gibson was bullied up until the sixth grade, when he became large enough to defend himself - however, he started bullying other children. He often got in trouble for fighting, talking in class, and not following directions.[2] This continued outside of school, with a childhood friend, Melodie Schultz, claiming that Gibson had shot another child in the eye with a pellet gun.

Celebrated in both the architectural and popular press as a tour-de-force of late modernism, it was a splendid example of Graves' imaginative, sophisticated work. It stood, along with Graves' Hanselman House, Richard Meier's New Harmony Athenaeum \u2014which was related to the Snyderman House\u2014and the buildings of Columbus, Indiana, as national icons of modern architecture located in the state of Indiana (Graves' home state).\nIn her feature article on the Snyderman House in Progressive Architecture, Suzanne Stephens wrote in 1978 that \"Because of the house's successful fragments and particular spaces, because of its manner of referring back to previous work as well as anticipating that which is to come, it will probably occupy a prominent place in the history of Michael Graves' oeuvre.\"\nMartin Filler, in an overview of Graves' work as of 1980, wrote that \"The Synderman House is a central work in Michael Graves' career. It is his largest completed building to date, but its significance comes not from its size. It is transitional work, and transitional works in architecture are much rarer than in other art forms, a result of the architectural artifact taking so long to produce.  The Snyderman House, designed in 1972 and completed five years later, spans Michael Graves' two stylistic phases.  The house is composed of a white, cage-like exterior frame, typical of his first projects.

This is an early Michael Graves building with a later Michael Graves building trapped inside it, fighting to emerge.  Its debt both in form and color to the earlier work of John Hejduk, and its impact on later work by other architects (such as Richard Meier's Atheneum of 1975-70 in New Harmony, Ind.) confirm it as an important work of the 1970's.\"\n"

The family lived \"in a house near the intersection of St. Clair and Delaware Streets\" in downtown Indianapolis. Tucker worked as a farmer for City Postmaster Samuel Henderson.[1]\nOn the afternoon of July 4, 1845, John Tucker was lynched in downtown Indianapolis. Finding himself being accosted by a drunken white man, Nicholas Wood, Tucker began to walk toward the Indianapolis Magistrate's office to seek help. But Wood was soon joined by two other white men, William Ballenger (a saloon owner) and Edward Davis.[1] According to the Indiana State Sentinel, an Indiana newspaper that covered the lynching, the assailants attacked Tucker with clubs, stones, and brickbats.[2] The minister of Second Presbyterian Church, located very near the site of Tucker's death, Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, wrote that Tucker \"defended himself with desperate determination\" during the attack.[1] While a few people attempted to \"separate Tucker from his assaulters,\" a large crowd gathered who cheered for Tucker's death.[1] Those involved continued to beat Tucker after he was already dead.[3]\n"

They were memorialized in 2022.\nA white mob lynched George Johnson, Squire Taylor, and Charles Davis, all Black men, in Charlestown, Clark County, Indiana, in 1871.[1] The three men were accused of killing the family of Cyprus Park, a farmer who lived near Henryville, Indiana. A neighbor near the Parks family believed that he was also a target but managed to keep the assailants out of his home. The neighbor believed that the assailants were white. Even so, George Johnson, a Black man, was arrested on suspicion of committing the murders and was tortured until he confessed. He also gave out the names of two other Black men, Squire Taylor, and Charles Davis. These men were then arrested. The trial followed quite quickly. The grand jury declared the men not guilty based on the lack of evidence, but the men remained in custody and were sent to a Charlestown jail.[1]\nSoon after arrival, a white mob gathered and took the three men from the jail. The mob then hanged all three men and tortured Squire Taylor before he was killed. The guilt of the men in question was viewed as highly dubious by some at the time. Information about this spectacle lynching was released only a year later in a pamphlet titled, \u201cMurder and Mob Law in Indiana,\u201d  by James Hiatt. The author decried the lack of proof of the Black men's guilt and acknowledged the overwhelming evidence of their innocence.[2] No one was charged or arrested for the murder of these men even though the family came forward with names of suspects and filed a law suit against the sheriff involved. The actions of the white mob led the Indiana governor at the time, Conrad Baker, to call for the suppression of illegal organizations. Referring to the Enforcement Act of 1870, adopted during Reconstruction, Baker proposed that the U.S. Federal government could be asked to intervene to stop the actions of mobs that terrorized Black people. The Indiana government, however, did not follow through on that proposal and mob violence continued.[3]\n"

The riots occurred after a black man shot and killed a white policeman and ultimately resulted in 12 deaths.[1][2][3]\nOn July 3, an African-American man named Lee Brown, aka Robert Lee, had a dispute with another African-American man, Tom Berry, at a bar and attempted to return to the bar with a gun but was stopped by Louis N. Massey, the most senior policeman on the force. Massey attempted to arrest Brown but Brown shot and fatally wounded Massey, however Massey was able to fire back before dying, wounding Brown who eventually succumbed to injuries as well on July 31.[1][3] A mob of several thousand citizens (mostly all white) formed outside the Vanderburgh County Jail on July 6 and attempted to storm the jail with the intention of lynching Brown and 16 other black inmates. Around 200 militiamen then opened fire on the mob, killing and injuring several rioters. The crowd then began looting hardware stores of weapons and stormed into black neighborhoods in an attempt to expel black people from Evansville.[1][2][3][4] The rioting continued until July 10 and a total of 12 people died during the riot, with more than 40 others seriously wounded and about 2,000 of Evansville's 8,000 black residents fleeing the city.[5][1][4]\nIt is unclear as to whether the mob or the militia were to blame for the deaths. Several accounts describe the escalation as coming to a head after a rock was thrown by someone in the crowd, at the militia, who in turn fired warning shots which caused chaos.[6]\n"

Multiple people, including a seven-year-old girl, were wounded when gunfire broke out.\nAmidst racial tensions during the summer of 1919, a group of white youths in Indianapolis thought that they were being followed by groups of African-Americans. On July 14, 1919, hundreds of white boys 16 to 19 years old converged on Garfield Park. There they used bricks and clubs to beat any black people they came across. When a group of African-Americans took shelter in the house of Nathan Weather, a local black man, the white mob followed them and surrounded the house. Weather fired into the crowd in hopes of dispersing the mob. A seven-year-old onlooker, Charlotte Pieper, received a flesh wound from stray buckshot. Another youth, Paul Karbwitz, 18, was also hit. Police were eventually able to disperse the mob and quell the riot.[1]\nThis uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer of 1919. The Summer consisted of terrorist attacks on black communities, and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events such as the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also occurring in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and the Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people, respectively, and with both having many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.[2]\n"

The events began as a workers strike by the union employees of the Indianapolis Traction & Terminal Company and their allies on Halloween night, October 31, 1913. The company was responsible for public transportation in Indianapolis, the capital city and transportation hub of the U.S. state of Indiana. The unionization effort was being organized by the Amalgamated Street Railway Employees of America who had successfully enforced strikes in other major United States cities. Company management suppressed the initial attempt by some of its employees to unionize and rejected an offer of mediation by the United States Department of Labor, which led to a rapid rise in tensions, and ultimately the strike. Government response to the strike was politically charged, as the strike began during the week leading up to public elections. The strike effectively shut down mass transit in the city and caused severe interruptions of statewide rail transportation and the 1913 city elections.\nA riot that lasted four days broke out on November 2 when strikebreakers attempted to restart transit services. At its height, eight to ten thousand rioters flooded downtown Indianapolis and vandalized the city's main business district. Numerous workers, strikebreakers, policemen, and bystanders were injured. Two strikebreakers and four union members were killed. The city police were unable to control the situation and refused orders to combat the rioters as the violence worsened. After pleas for help from city leaders following continued rioting on Election Day, Governor Samuel Ralston called out the Indiana National Guard and put the city under martial law on the evening of November 5.\n"

A neighbor near the Parks family believed that he was also a target but managed to keep the assailants out of his home. The neighbor believed that the assailants were white. Even so, George Johnson, a Black man, was arrested on suspicion of committing the murders and was tortured until he confessed. He also gave out the names of two other Black men, Squire Taylor, and Charles Davis. These men were then arrested. The trial followed quite quickly. The grand jury declared the men not guilty based on the lack of evidence, but the men remained in custody and were sent to a Charlestown jail.[1]\nSoon after arrival, a white mob gathered and took the three men from the jail. The mob then hanged all three men and tortured Squire Taylor before he was killed. The guilt of the men in question was viewed as highly dubious by some at the time. Information about this spectacle lynching was released only a year later in a pamphlet titled, \u201cMurder and Mob Law in Indiana,\u201d  by James Hiatt. The author decried the lack of proof of the Black men's guilt and acknowledged the overwhelming evidence of their innocence.[2] No one was charged or arrested for the murder of these men even though the family came forward with names of suspects and filed a law suit against the sheriff involved. The actions of the white mob led the Indiana governor at the time, Conrad Baker, to call for the suppression of illegal organizations. Referring to the Enforcement Act of 1870, adopted during Reconstruction, Baker proposed that the U.S. Federal government could be asked to intervene to stop the actions of mobs that terrorized Black people. The Indiana government, however, did not follow through on that proposal and mob violence continued.[3]\n"

Scott\u2019s body remained there until he was discovered by the Clay County Coroner, Dr. George Pell, who transported Scott\u2019s body to the courthouse around seven in the morning.[2] Prior to this, Scott\u2019s hanged body had been viewed by \u201cseveral thousand\u201d individuals. After his body was transported to the courthouse,\u00a0it was \u201cexhibited for public inspection\u201d before finally being released to family members near Indianapolis.[1]\nThis crime-related article is a stub.

Massey attempted to arrest Brown but Brown shot and fatally wounded Massey, however Massey was able to fire back before dying, wounding Brown who eventually succumbed to injuries as well on July 31.[1][3] A mob of several thousand citizens (mostly all white) formed outside the Vanderburgh County Jail on July 6 and attempted to storm the jail with the intention of lynching Brown and 16 other black inmates. Around 200 militiamen then opened fire on the mob, killing and injuring several rioters. The crowd then began looting hardware stores of weapons and stormed into black neighborhoods in an attempt to expel black people from Evansville.[1][2][3][4] The rioting continued until July 10 and a total of 12 people died during the riot, with more than 40 others seriously wounded and about 2,000 of Evansville's 8,000 black residents fleeing the city.[5][1][4]\nIt is unclear as to whether the mob or the militia were to blame for the deaths.

Multiple people, including a seven-year-old girl, were wounded when gunfire broke out.\nAmidst racial tensions during the summer of 1919, a group of white youths in Indianapolis thought that they were being followed by groups of African-Americans. On July 14, 1919, hundreds of white boys 16 to 19 years old converged on Garfield Park. There they used bricks and clubs to beat any black people they came across. When a group of African-Americans took shelter in the house of Nathan Weather, a local black man, the white mob followed them and surrounded the house. Weather fired into the crowd in hopes of dispersing the mob. A seven-year-old onlooker, Charlotte Pieper, received a flesh wound from stray buckshot. Another youth, Paul Karbwitz, 18, was also hit. Police were eventually able to disperse the mob and quell the riot.[1]\nThis uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer of 1919. The Summer consisted of terrorist attacks on black communities, and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events such as the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also occurring in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and the Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people, respectively, and with both having many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.[2]\n"

The events began as a workers strike by the union employees of the Indianapolis Traction & Terminal Company and their allies on Halloween night, October 31, 1913. The company was responsible for public transportation in Indianapolis, the capital city and transportation hub of the U.S. state of Indiana. The unionization effort was being organized by the Amalgamated Street Railway Employees of America who had successfully enforced strikes in other major United States cities. Company management suppressed the initial attempt by some of its employees to unionize and rejected an offer of mediation by the United States Department of Labor, which led to a rapid rise in tensions, and ultimately the strike. Government response to the strike was politically charged, as the strike began during the week leading up to public elections. The strike effectively shut down mass transit in the city and caused severe interruptions of statewide rail transportation and the 1913 city elections.\nA riot that lasted four days broke out on November 2 when strikebreakers attempted to restart transit services. At its height, eight to ten thousand rioters flooded downtown Indianapolis and vandalized the city's main business district. Numerous workers, strikebreakers, policemen, and bystanders were injured. Two strikebreakers and four union members were killed. The city police were unable to control the situation and refused orders to combat the rioters as the violence worsened. After pleas for help from city leaders following continued rioting on Election Day, Governor Samuel Ralston called out the Indiana National Guard and put the city under martial law on the evening of November 5.\n"

It is suspected that she killed her first husband, Robert Gibson, as well.[3] She was \"considered one of the most daring woman criminals in the country,\" earning the nickname \"feminine Bluebeard.\"[1]\nGreen and her childhood sweetheart, Gibson, eloped on March 14, 1908 at Covington, Kentucky, and moved to Cleveland where he worked as a teacher while she became a writer for a newspaper.[4] The couple came up with a get-rich-quick scheme where they travelled from town to town, writing and selling books of local historic areas. Their plan failed. While in Huntsville, Missouri, Gibson became ill with an unusual illness. He died March 18, 1920, leaving Clara a widow and the sole beneficiary of a $3,000 life insurance policy.[4]\nA few months after her first husband's death, Green met and married Frank Carl on September 14, 1920, with the impression that he was wealthy.[4] This was a tumultuous relationship, and at one point Mrs. Carl filed a complaint for divorce against her husband in the Hancock Circuit Court. When asked by Mrs. Lizzie Maynard what her grounds for divorce were, Clara replied that \"if the law did not provide a way there was always some way.\"[4] In order to get her to drop the divorce lawsuit, Frank made her the sole beneficiary of his life insurance policy, worth $2,000.[1] In 1921, Clara and Frank invited Frank's elderly father, Alonzo Carl, 85, to come live with them in Philadelphia, Indiana.[1] According to Frank's brother, Herman Carl, his father was in good health when he went to live with the couple.[4] Like Clara's first husband, Alonzo became gravely ill by an unknown illness and died in August 1921.[4] Expecting property from her father-in-law, Clara was furious to find that it had been given to her husband's brother-in-law Dr. Iles. Two months later, Frank was dead, suffering the same illness. The day after her husband's funeral, Clara asked Herman to meet with her to discuss obtaining Alonzo's property from Dr. Iles.[4] Her suspicious actions aroused skepticism among her neighbors who demanded an investigation. Frank and Alonzo's bodies were exhumed, revealing that each man had enough arsenic in his system \"to kill a dozen men\", according to the prosecutor.\"[1] Clara was arrested and charged in January 1922.[4]\n"

A habitual criminal noted for his increasingly violent streaks and his handlebar moustache, Gibson has claimed responsibility for upwards of 30 additional murders across multiple states, none of which have been confirmed.\nWilliam Clyde Gibson III was born on October 10, 1957, in Raleigh, North Carolina, the youngest of four children born to William, Jr., a foreman for a tree-trimming company, and Jeraline \"Geri\" Gibson, a cashier at a Sears store. When he was two years old, the family moved out of state and settled in New Albany, Indiana, where Gibson grew up. In later interviews, he claimed that he had never experienced any abuse or neglect from either of his parents. He said he was even spoiled but acknowledged that his father was an alcoholic who would become combative when drunk.[1]\nFrom an early age, Gibson displayed odd behavior, having trouble speaking to others, struggling at school, and preferring to stay home with his mother. Whenever he went to school, Gibson was bullied up until the sixth grade, when he became large enough to defend himself - however, he started bullying other children. He often got in trouble for fighting, talking in class, and not following directions.[2] This continued outside of school, with a childhood friend, Melodie Schultz, claiming that Gibson had shot another child in the eye with a pellet gun. At age 13, he also started drinking and later that year, would be arrested for stealing a motorbike.[2]\n"

Two days later, he returned to Fort Wayne, Indiana, and went to police headquarters to surrender.\nKiefer did not appear to show remorse for the murders of his wife and his daughter. He was charged with both the murders, but he only went to trial for his wife's murder.  He was convicted in 1958 and sentenced to death. However, in 1958, the conviction was overturned by the Indiana Supreme Court, which noted that at his first trial, the jury was shown photographs of the slashed victims' bodies, and the jury was emotionally fueled by the photos to sentence Kiefer to death.

The family lived \"in a house near the intersection of St. Clair and Delaware Streets\" in downtown Indianapolis. Tucker worked as a farmer for City Postmaster Samuel Henderson.[1]\nOn the afternoon of July 4, 1845, John Tucker was lynched in downtown Indianapolis. Finding himself being accosted by a drunken white man, Nicholas Wood, Tucker began to walk toward the Indianapolis Magistrate's office to seek help. But Wood was soon joined by two other white men, William Ballenger (a saloon owner) and Edward Davis.[1] According to the Indiana State Sentinel, an Indiana newspaper that covered the lynching, the assailants attacked Tucker with clubs, stones, and brickbats.[2] The minister of Second Presbyterian Church, located very near the site of Tucker's death, Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, wrote that Tucker \"defended himself with desperate determination\" during the attack.[1] While a few people attempted to \"separate Tucker from his assaulters,\" a large crowd gathered who cheered for Tucker's death.[1] Those involved continued to beat Tucker after he was already dead.[3]\n"

Dudley, to invoke Indiana's 1899 anti-lynching law by requesting that Governor Winfield Durbin send in militia.[5][6][4] The militia was sent from Vincennes, many miles south of the mob and too far away to make it before Dudley conceded Dillard to the mob.[4]\n"

They were memorialized in 2022.\nA white mob lynched George Johnson, Squire Taylor, and Charles Davis, all Black men, in Charlestown, Clark County, Indiana, in 1871.[1] The three men were accused of killing the family of Cyprus Park, a farmer who lived near Henryville, Indiana. A neighbor near the Parks family believed that he was also a target but managed to keep the assailants out of his home. The neighbor believed that the assailants were white. Even so, George Johnson, a Black man, was arrested on suspicion of committing the murders and was tortured until he confessed. He also gave out the names of two other Black men, Squire Taylor, and Charles Davis. These men were then arrested. The trial followed quite quickly. The grand jury declared the men not guilty based on the lack of evidence, but the men remained in custody and were sent to a Charlestown jail.[1]\nSoon after arrival, a white mob gathered and took the three men from the jail. The mob then hanged all three men and tortured Squire Taylor before he was killed. The guilt of the men in question was viewed as highly dubious by some at the time. Information about this spectacle lynching was released only a year later in a pamphlet titled, \u201cMurder and Mob Law in Indiana,\u201d  by James Hiatt. The author decried the lack of proof of the Black men's guilt and acknowledged the overwhelming evidence of their innocence.[2] No one was charged or arrested for the murder of these men even though the family came forward with names of suspects and filed a law suit against the sheriff involved. The actions of the white mob led the Indiana governor at the time, Conrad Baker, to call for the suppression of illegal organizations. Referring to the Enforcement Act of 1870, adopted during Reconstruction, Baker proposed that the U.S. Federal government could be asked to intervene to stop the actions of mobs that terrorized Black people. The Indiana government, however, did not follow through on that proposal and mob violence continued.[3]\n"

He had left Indianapolis in the spring of 1901 and it is unknown why he was in Sullivan County.[1]\nIn November 1902, residents in Sullivan and Knox counties accused James Dillard of assaulting two white women, the wives of Milton Davis and John Lemon.[2][3] On November 19, police apprehended Dillard in Lawrenceville, Illinois, shooting him three times in the process.[2][4] After police arrested Dillard, they transported him to Sullivan.[4] While being transported, a mob of approximately 50 local farmers gathered in the area, causing the Sullivan County sheriff, John S. Dudley, to invoke Indiana's 1899 anti-lynching law by requesting that Governor Winfield Durbin send in militia.[5][6][4] The militia was sent from Vincennes, many miles south of the mob and too far away to make it before Dudley conceded Dillard to the mob.[4]\n"

They were memorialized in 2022.\nA white mob lynched George Johnson, Squire Taylor, and Charles Davis, all Black men, in Charlestown, Clark County, Indiana, in 1871.[1] The three men were accused of killing the family of Cyprus Park, a farmer who lived near Henryville, Indiana. A neighbor near the Parks family believed that he was also a target but managed to keep the assailants out of his home. The neighbor believed that the assailants were white. Even so, George Johnson, a Black man, was arrested on suspicion of committing the murders and was tortured until he confessed. He also gave out the names of two other Black men, Squire Taylor, and Charles Davis. These men were then arrested. The trial followed quite quickly. The grand jury declared the men not guilty based on the lack of evidence, but the men remained in custody and were sent to a Charlestown jail.[1]\nSoon after arrival, a white mob gathered and took the three men from the jail. The mob then hanged all three men and tortured Squire Taylor before he was killed. The guilt of the men in question was viewed as highly dubious by some at the time. Information about this spectacle lynching was released only a year later in a pamphlet titled, \u201cMurder and Mob Law in Indiana,\u201d  by James Hiatt. The author decried the lack of proof of the Black men's guilt and acknowledged the overwhelming evidence of their innocence.[2] No one was charged or arrested for the murder of these men even though the family came forward with names of suspects and filed a law suit against the sheriff involved. The actions of the white mob led the Indiana governor at the time, Conrad Baker, to call for the suppression of illegal organizations. Referring to the Enforcement Act of 1870, adopted during Reconstruction, Baker proposed that the U.S. Federal government could be asked to intervene to stop the actions of mobs that terrorized Black people. The Indiana government, however, did not follow through on that proposal and mob violence continued.[3]\n"

In Russell's band, he met the trumpeter Fats Navarro, who influenced him to play in the style of the tenor saxophonist Lester Young. Johnson played in Benny Carter's orchestra between 1942 and 1945,[3] and made his first recordings in 1943 under Carter's leadership, recording his first solo (on \"Love for Sale\") in October 1943. In 1944, he took part in the first Jazz at the Philharmonic concert,[3] presented in Los Angeles and organized by Norman Granz.[4] In 1945, he joined the big band of Count Basie, touring and recording with him until 1946.[3]\n"

While still a young man, he swooned and soon married a Miss Van Meter, from Rushville, who gave birth to four children - Alice, Leslie, Ethel and Clyde (all of them later moved to Indianapolis). The family was regarded as an ordinary and happy one, with Pruitt at the helm of it.[1]\nIn 1888, the first Mrs. Pruitt suddenly died from poisoning. This event shocked the citizens of Edinburgh, but no suspicion was directed at Pleasant, at all. His seemingly righteous way of living prevented any investigation into the matter, leaving the people to wonder if the death was just a simple accident. Mrs. Pruitt's death remained an unsolved mystery, and Pleasant continued living as a respected and honorable man.[1]\n"

He had worked as a streetcar conductor in Cincinnati and was a \"career hoodlum, moonshiner, car thief and murderer\" prior to killing the federal agent. He was known as the \"Diamond King\" because he supposedly carried diamonds in his pocket.[3][4]\nOn September 2, 1930, Barrett shot and killed his own 71-year-old mother (who had reportedly whipped his 11-year-old son) and pistol whipped his sister Rachel, who was shot through the ear.[5] His two brothers posted a $500 reward for his capture.[6]  After eight months of being on the run, he turned himself in the next spring and was charged with killing his mother and wounding his sister.[7] The trial resulted in a hung jury. It was later reported that he had been tried for killing both his mother and sister, however, while he later admitted he had shot his mother in self-defense, he denied killing his sister, who he said died of pneumonia.[3] (According to records, Rachael Barrett Maupin did die of double bronchial pneumonia on October 18, 1930, a month after the attack.)[8]\n"

He was also the first person to be legally hanged in Parke County, Indiana, after murdering his neighbor, George Mickelberry, over a dispute.\nNoah Beauchamp was born in Maryland to Thomas and Sarah Adams Beauchamp. As an adult Noah was over six feet tall, burly and had a ruddy complexion. He was said to have been quick to anger and as a young man, Beauchamp had a disagreement with his father over the morality of slavery. The younger Beauchamp was very religious, a devout Baptist, and he was vehemently against slavery. His father, who owned slaves, may have disowned Noah, who soon left for Kentucky and then Ohio, where he may have met Elizabeth Adams who became his wife. His first child, Noah Beauchamp, Jr., was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on November 29, 1804.\nBy 1811, Beauchamp had moved with his family to Connersville Township in Fayette County in the Indiana Territory, where he set up a blacksmith shop. On December 14, 1812, Beauchamp purchased a tract of land in Fayette County and lived there until the 1820s, the family moved to Edgar County, Illinois. Noah was appointed a lieutenant of the Eleventh Indiana Territorial Regiment on April 29, 1814. The Eleventh regiment was one of the best organized of the Indiana regiments.[1]\n"

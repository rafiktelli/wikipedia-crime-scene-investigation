The date of her birth is unknown.[3] Josefa's actual name has been a topic of debate among historians and scholars. Before the Chicano Civil Rights Movement, most scholars stated that Josefa had no recorded last name. In Gordon Young's Days of 49, he says that her name was \"Juanita\".[4] Hubert Bancroft, in his account of the events[5] at Downieville, refers to Segovia as either \"The Mexican\" or \"the little woman\" but used \"Juanita\" during his description of her trial.[6] Historian Rodolpho F. Acuna stated her name was Juana Loaiza citing an 1877 Schedule of Mexican Claims Against the United States that listed a Jose Maria Loiza as claiming damages for the lynching of his wife. However, the name does not show up in the 1850 census, which suggests that the claim may have been fraudulent.[7] In 1976, Martha Cotera, an influential activist of both the Chicano Movement and Chicana Feminist Movement, informed Chicano scholars that her last name was Segovia.[2]\n"

Jackson attempted to coerce the release of the Soledad Brothers (including his older brother George) by kidnapping Superior Court judge Harold Haley from the Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael, California. As the kidnappers attempted to leave with five hostages by car, court officers shot at Jackson's retreating van, leaving four people dead, including Jonathan Jackson and Judge Haley. Three others were wounded. The event received intense media coverage, as did the subsequent manhunt and trial of Angela Davis, an ousted professor from UCLA with connections to George and Jonathan Jackson, and the Black Panthers. Davis owned the weapons used in the incident but stated that she had no knowledge of its happening. On October 8 of that year, the Weathermen detonated explosives in support of the earlier incident.\nIn the summer of 1969, W.L. Nolen, a twenty-year-old inmate at Soledad prison in California, who had been convicted in 1963 for robbery, began circulating a petition to file a lawsuit against the prison's superintendent, Cletus J. Fitzharris, charging that guards and officials at the facility knew of \"existing social and racial conflicts\" and that they had been seeking to excite them through \"direct harassment and in ways not actionable in court\", including the filing of false disciplinary reports and intentionally leaving black inmates' cells unlocked to put them in danger of assault. He claimed officials were \"willfully creating and maintaining situations that creates and poses dangers to the plaintiff [himself]\" and that he \"feared for his life.\"[1]\n"

This increase in racial tension across the nation fed to rising concerns about the African-American population. The Black Panther Party was created to watch the actions of police forces in Los Angeles making sure that they were protecting the public as a whole, not a specific race.[3] In Oakland, the number of arrests dramatically increased, which led to an increase in prison populations. In the State of California's prisoners statistics it states that the populations of inmates on December 31, 1960, was 21,660 persons. 8 years later on December 31, 1968 the population had increased to a high of 28,462.[4] During the 1960s the black distribution in California prisons was 20.8 percent but gradually increased to 34.1 percent by the 1980s.[4] The same people who were demanding social reforms found themselves in jail demanding prison reforms for those of color. From this rise in black inmate population came the Black Cultural Association, or the BCA.

At 160,557 acres (649.75\u00a0km2),  the Station Fire was at the time the 9th largest wildfire in modern California history.[5][15] It remains the largest wildfire in the modern history of Los Angeles County, surpassing the 105,000-acre (164\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 425\u00a0km2) Clampitt Fire of September 1970.\n"

Gracey retired from the company on October 4, 1975.[3]\nOn September 5, 1983, Gracey was shot and killed in Los Angeles by a burglar. His wife was injured in the attack. Gracey and his wife, Beverly, were staying overnight at their cabana at the Bel Air Bay Club, on Pacific Coast Highway in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of western Los Angeles.

The case received national attention due to one of the assumed victims being Walter Collins, the nine-year-old son of Christine Collins, who had gone missing in March of that year. While authorities initially considered the possibility that the total number of boys killed on the farm might have been as high as 20, this theory was eliminated as the investigation began to unfold.

At Folsom Prison, Allen used to refer to Hamilton as his \"good dog\", though at the time of Allen's trial, he claimed to only have met Hamilton three or four times.\nAfter Hamilton was paroled from Folsom Prison, Kenneth Allen, one of Allen's sons supplied Hamilton with $100. Hamilton and his girlfriend Connie Barbo went to Fran's Market in Fresno, California where one of the witnesses, Bryon Schletewitz worked. On September 5, 1980, Hamilton murdered Schletewitz and fellow employees Josephine Rocha, 17, and Douglas White, 18, with a sawn-off shotgun and wounded two other people, Joe Rios and Jack Abbott. Hamilton shot Schletewitz at near point-blank range in the forehead and murdered Rocha and White after forcing them to lie on the ground within the store. A neighbor, Jack Abbott, who heard the shotgun blasts came to investigate and was shot by Hamilton. Abbott returned fire and wounded Hamilton, who escaped from the scene.\n"

Acuna stated her name was Juana Loaiza citing an 1877 Schedule of Mexican Claims Against the United States that listed a Jose Maria Loiza as claiming damages for the lynching of his wife. However, the name does not show up in the 1850 census, which suggests that the claim may have been fraudulent.[7] In 1976, Martha Cotera, an influential activist of both the Chicano Movement and Chicana Feminist Movement, informed Chicano scholars that her last name was Segovia.[2]\n"

He was shot and killed during an apparent robbery attempt in Hollywood.[2]  The Los Angeles Police Department later arrested three suspects but soon released them for lack of evidence. No other suspects have ever been identified, and the killing remains unsolved.[3]\nThe case attracted some media coverage at the time, because Nigg had formerly worked at the Mezzaluna restaurant in Brentwood, where he had befriended Ronald Goldman. Almost 15 months earlier, Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson had been found slain at her home near the restaurant, after he had gone there to return her mother's eyeglasses, which had been left behind at Mezzaluna. Simpson's ex-husband, former football star O. J. Simpson, had been charged with the murders, and his highly publicized trial had reached closing arguments.\n"

He was just starting to make a life for himself. He was starting to get into something where he was making a good living.\" But Harriman went on to describe his son as a \"restless kid\" who was \"trying to find himself. He wanted to get out of California for a while\".[4] He left home at age 16 and traveled around the United States for three years before settling in Los Angeles in 1985. He received his GED from the L.A. Unified School District in 1989.[2] Newton's friends describe him as somebody who saw himself much more of a poet and an illustrative artist and only did adult material for economic reasons.[2]\n"

The television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation popularized the reliability of DNA matching with the public as well. Simpson's celebrity status faded among African Americans after he relocated to Florida and disappeared from the public eye. His arrest and conviction in 2008 for armed robbery brought him back into the public spot light, especially after he received a disproportionately higher prison sentence than his co-conspirators, which generated controversy even from his detractors,[14][15][16][17] but the response from African Americans was relatively muted,[18] and pundits opined this demonstrated how much the conscience of Black America has evolved since the time the verdict was announced.[19][20]\n"

The investigation ultimately led to a broad police corruption scandal. While rooted in the facts of the Short murder and featuring many real-life people, places and events, Ellroy's novel blends facts and fiction, most notably in providing a solution to the crime when in reality it has never been solved. James Ellroy dedicated The Black Dahlia, \"To Geneva Hilliker Ellroy 1915-1958 Mother: Twenty-nine Years Later, This Valediction in Blood.\" The epigraph for The Black Dahlia is \"Now I fold you down, my drunkard, my navigator, My first lost keeper, to love and look at later. -Anne Sexton.\"\nThis book is considered the one that gained Ellroy critical attention as a serious writer of literature, expanding his renown beyond the crime novels of his early career.[1][2] The Black Dahlia is the first book in Ellroy's L.A. Quartet, a cycle of novels set in 1940s and 1950s Los Angeles. He portrays the city in this period as a hotbed of political corruption and depravity. The Quartet continues with The Big Nowhere, L.A.

She was found by children in Babe Ruth baseball and their coaches on June 22, 1958. The road lay beside the playing field at Arroyo High School.

The book was published by Regnery Publishing in May, 2008, and discusses Gilbert's 18-year-long relationship with Simpson, including the influence of their personal and professional relationship in the lead up to, during, and following the trial.[1] Gilbert revealed that the gloves did not fit because, on his advice, Simpson stopped taking his arthritis medicine, which made his hands swell.[2] Gilbert's book also details Simpson confessing to the killings.[3] Gilbert describes how Simpson, having smoked marijuana, taken a sleeping pill, and while drinking beer, confided to him at his Brentwood home weeks after his trial what happened the night of the murders. Simpson said, \"If she hadn't opened that door with a knife in her hand... she'd still be alive.\" This, Gilbert said, confirmed his belief that Simpson had confessed.[4]\n"

Personally convinced of Simpson's guilt, Bugliosi blames his acquittal on the district attorney, the judge, and especially the prosecuting attorneys Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden.\nUpon its release, the book was subject to criticism from various critics.

They employed the metaphor of a 'dagger' to emphasise his ruthless tone.[2] Similarly, the San Francisco Chronicle praised the book for its observational and authoritative tone which followers of the case were longing for.[3] The Globe and Mail described the book as \"engagingly idiosyncratic, and occasionally self-serving and simplistic.\"[4]\n"

Simpson murder case was announced and Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder.[1] Although the nation observed the same evidence presented at trial, a division along racial lines emerged in observers opinion of the verdict, which the media dubbed the \"racial gap\".[2] Polling showed that most African Americans believed Simpson was innocent[3] and justice had been served, while most White Americans felt he was guilty and the verdict was a racially motivated jury nullification[4][5] by a mostly African-American jury.[6] Current polling shows the gap has narrowed since the trial, with the majority of black respondents in 2016 stating they believed Simpson was guilty.[7][8][9] The narrowing racial gap is primarily attributed to several factors: Daniel Petrocelli disproving all of the blood planting claims at the wrongful death civil trial,[10] defense witness Henry Lee published a peer review study in 1996 that effectively refuted the contamination claim that disputed the validity of the states DNA evidence, and the fading of Simpson's celebrity status since the trial.[11]\nMost African Americans believed Simpson was innocent,[12] but that changed one year later after the civil trial when Barry Scheck's contamination claim and all of his blood planting claims were disproven.[13] Without either of them, defending Simpson's innocence became increasingly untenable as there was no justification for doubting the DNA evidence against him. The television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation popularized the reliability of DNA matching with the public as well. Simpson's celebrity status faded among African Americans after he relocated to Florida and disappeared from the public eye. His arrest and conviction in 2008 for armed robbery brought him back into the public spot light, especially after he received a disproportionately higher prison sentence than his co-conspirators, which generated controversy even from his detractors,[14][15][16][17] but the response from African Americans was relatively muted,[18] and pundits opined this demonstrated how much the conscience of Black America has evolved since the time the verdict was announced.[19][20]\n"

He was starting to get into something where he was making a good living.\" But Harriman went on to describe his son as a \"restless kid\" who was \"trying to find himself. He wanted to get out of California for a while\".[4] He left home at age 16 and traveled around the United States for three years before settling in Los Angeles in 1985. He received his GED from the L.A. Unified School District in 1989.[2] Newton's friends describe him as somebody who saw himself much more of a poet and an illustrative artist and only did adult material for economic reasons.[2]\n"

The television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation popularized the reliability of DNA matching with the public as well. Simpson's celebrity status faded among African Americans after he relocated to Florida and disappeared from the public eye. His arrest and conviction in 2008 for armed robbery brought him back into the public spot light, especially after he received a disproportionately higher prison sentence than his co-conspirators, which generated controversy even from his detractors,[14][15][16][17] but the response from African Americans was relatively muted,[18] and pundits opined this demonstrated how much the conscience of Black America has evolved since the time the verdict was announced.[19][20]\n"

While rooted in the facts of the Short murder and featuring many real-life people, places and events, Ellroy's novel blends facts and fiction, most notably in providing a solution to the crime when in reality it has never been solved.

Quartet, a cycle of novels set in 1940s and 1950s Los Angeles. He portrays the city in this period as a hotbed of political corruption and depravity. The Quartet continues with The Big Nowhere, L.A.

Its subject is the 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short in Los Angeles, California, which received wide attention because her corpse was horrifically mutilated and discarded in an empty residential lot. The investigation ultimately led to a broad police corruption scandal. While rooted in the facts of the Short murder and featuring many real-life people, places and events, Ellroy's novel blends facts and fiction, most notably in providing a solution to the crime when in reality it has never been solved. James Ellroy dedicated The Black Dahlia, \"To Geneva Hilliker Ellroy 1915-1958 Mother: Twenty-nine Years Later, This Valediction in Blood.\" The epigraph for The Black Dahlia is \"Now I fold you down, my drunkard, my navigator, My first lost keeper, to love and look at later. -Anne Sexton.\"\nThis book is considered the one that gained Ellroy critical attention as a serious writer of literature, expanding his renown beyond the crime novels of his early career.[1][2] The Black Dahlia is the first book in Ellroy's L.A. Quartet, a cycle of novels set in 1940s and 1950s Los Angeles. He portrays the city in this period as a hotbed of political corruption and depravity. The Quartet continues with The Big Nowhere, L.A. Confidential, and White Jazz.\n"

Ellroy's mother Geneva was murdered in 1958, when he was 10 years old, and the killer was never identified. The book is Ellroy's account of his attempt to solve the mystery by hiring a retired Los Angeles County homicide detective to investigate the crime. Ellroy also explores how being directly affected by a crime shaped his life - often for the worse - and led him to write crime novels. The book is dedicated to his mother.\nGeneva Ellroy's strangled body was found by a roadside in El Monte, California. She was found by children in Babe Ruth baseball and their coaches on June 22, 1958. The road lay beside the playing field at Arroyo High School. Officers from the El Monte city police department handed over the investigation to the L.A. Sheriff\u2019s Homicide Bureau. They chased down leads gathered from the scene and from anonymous tips sent in by area citizens. Newspaper accounts about the murder were scarce, as well as the television news accounts. There were three murders that had occurred in El Monte in 1958 by that time, and all had been resolved very quickly. After all the leads went dry, the case was eventually abandoned and never solved.\n"

Unlike the 1976 version, which focused mainly on the police investigation and the murder trial (as did the book), this version focused mainly on Linda Kasabian's involvement with the Manson Family and their development.\nAfter breaking up with her husband, 19-year-old single mother Linda Kasabian seeks refuge with the Manson Family at Spahn Ranch and witnesses their indoctrination techniques. After attending the killings at the Sharon Tate house she flees Spahn Ranch but the Manson Family keeps her daughter in their custody, knowing that this will force her to return. Her daughter and all of the other children are taken by Social Services during a raid on Spahn Ranch after Manson burns municipal earthmoving equipment that he believes is being used to make it harder for him to find the \"bottomless pit\" that he believes is described in Revelation 9 and \"Revolution 9\". The case is dropped due to an improperly executed warrant but confessions from Sadie and interviews with Kitty lead investigators to connect the Hinman, Tate, and LaBianca killings and issue warrants for the members of the Manson Family. Joey Dimarco and Paul Watkins explain to the detectives how the words \"Helter Skelter\" and \"Pig\" found written in blood at the crime scenes are related to the worldview of the Manson Family derived from passages in the Book of Revelation and the lyrics of the Beatles, thereby connecting Manson's philosophy to the murders themselves as acts intended to spark a race war he dubbed \"Helter Skelter\". Manson dismisses his counsel and represents himself at trial but is deemed unfit after disrupting proceedings. Linda Kasabian is given an immunity deal and ends up giving detailed testimony at trial. The accused members of the Manson Family are ultimately convicted of the murders but California repeals the death penalty in 1972, making them all eligible for parole.\n"

It premiered on DVD in the United States on January 17, 2006 and played in a few theatres on January 20, 27 and 28.\nThe film starts out with a futuristic Nomad from the year 3069 who accidentally discovers the book \"Helter Skelter\" while searching for food in a desert on the former site of Los Angeles. He mistakes the book as the Bible, and reads it as if Charles Hanson (most of the character names are derived from real people involved with the Manson murders, with their names altered by changing a letter into an 'H') is the messiah. As he reads, we flash back to 1969 where Susan Hatkins meets Charlie during a bad LSD trip. Charlie then renames her Hadie and she is accepted into his family where they plan things to change the world, and make music. After finding out that the snobby, nature hating actress Sharon Hate is supposed to be filming a movie in the desert where they are living, Charlie and the family plot to kill her. Charlie claims to get messages through songs, such as \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" by The Beatles, which tell him to kill Sharon Hate.\n"

Kennedy, the Watergate scandal, the Jonestown Massacre, the elections of former U.S. President George W.

Much of the book is based on government documents and stories from the back pages of mainstream American media, such as the New York Times, Newsweek and the Washington Post. The book finds common threads tying together the two Kennedy Assassinations, the Watergate burglary, Iran/Contra and even 9/11. Some of the same actors are implicated in all these events.

The group was composed of mostly Hawaiian subjects of American descent and American citizens who were members of the Missionary Party, as well as some foreign residents in the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi. The group planned and carried out the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi on January 17, 1893. The goal of this group was to achieve annexation of Hawai\u02bbi by the United States. The new independent Republic of Hawai\u02bbi government was thwarted in this goal by the administration of President Grover Cleveland, and it was not until 1898 that the United States Congress approved a joint resolution of annexation creating the U.S. Territory of Hawai\u02bbi.[1][2][3]\nThe Committee of Safety originated from a leadership group when members of the Missionary Party began to run as Independent Party candidates. For the elections of 1884 the Missionary Party strictly ran all candidates as Independent Party candidates. To ensure that Missionaries were on the Independent ticket the \"Committee of Nine\" was formed January 14, 1893, to assume the leadership position of the Independent Party. The Committee of Nine were staunchly loyal to the Missionary Party, having social and economic philosophies that reflected the Missionary values. The Independent Party won 13 seats and was the minority party in the Hawaii legislature. For the following elections of 1886 the committee reconvened, this time calling themselves the \"Committee of Thirteen\" due to the change in members. Their intent was to make the Independent Party the majority party in the legislature. At the end of the elections the Independents won ten seats, a net loss of three seats.\nIn January 1887 the Committee of Thirteen formed a secret society called the Hawaiian League. No official records were kept, but Lorrin A. Thurston (the grandson of American missionaries Asa Thurston and Lorrin Andrews) drafted the group's constitution. The group was headed by an executive committee of lawyers and businessmen mostly of non-aboriginal non-indigenous naturalized United States citizens. Membership grew through the year, including some German and British citizens, and a few part-Hawaiians.\nAlthough the politicians changed the name of their party from \"Missionary\" to \"Reform\", many wanted to become part of the United States, not just reform the monarchy.[4]:\u200a347\u2013350\u200a \nThis was why the Hawaiian League was also called the Annexation Club, although not often in public.\n",

His father was Benjamin C. Dillingham and mother was Lydia Sears Howes. At the age of fourteen he became a sailor on the Yankee clipper Southern Cross which was captured and destroyed by the Confederate steamer Florida in 1863 during the American Civil War. In 1865 he became first mate of a barque named Whistler that did a regular run between San Francisco and Honolulu. On his third trip to the island kingdom, Dillingham broke his leg after falling from a horse and was forced to convalesce in Hawaii.\nHe decided to stay in Honolulu and by the end of 1865 was a clerk at Diamond Hardware, which he bought out for $28,000 in 1869. On April 26, 1869, he married Emma Louise Smith (1844\u20131920), of a prominent missionary family. She was the daughter of Reverend Lowell Smith and Abigail Willis Tenney.[1] Dillingham turned out to be an astute businessman, and more importantly, was always willing to take risks. In 1879 he started a dairy farm in upper Honolulu, and during the 1880s became increasingly successful. He founded the Oahu Railway and Land Company (OR&L) that began service in November 1889. Dillingham was well-liked among Honolulu's various communities, and he included King Kal\u0101kaua and Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani as his friends. Although he disapproved of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893, he looked favorably on the American annexation in 1898, which he believed would bring long-term stability to the islands.

It was the second time an election for head of state was held. According to the Constitution of 1864, article 22 stated if the monarch dies before naming a successor \"such vacancy, shall cause a meeting of the Legislative Assembly, who shall elect by ballot some native Ali'i of the Kingdom as Successor,\" therefore the elections were held by the representatives not the public.  Only three candidates were considered seriously.[4]\nAfter the death of King Lunalilo on February 3, 1874, an electoral process began with Queen Emma, the widow of King Kamehameha IV, running against David Kalakaua. Emma was a popular choice among the people, especially in Honolulu, but her pro-British views were unpopular with the Hawaiian legislature dominated by pro-American factions, compared to Kalakaua, who was considered more sympathetic to growing power of the American business interest in the islands, so when election day came on February 12, she lost by a vote of thirty-nine to six, in the legislature. Her supporters were unhappy with the decision. The election proceedings were held at the Honolulu Courthouse, which is where an angry mob of about 100 of the queen's followers gathered. Since the Hawaiian army had been disbanded after a mutiny sometime before, and the militias were unreliable, there was nobody to stop the riot. The Honolulu police force deserted and also joined in the unrest, even fighting against each other depending on their political sympathies. The queen's followers first surrounded and besieged the courthouse at around 3:00 am, then went for the occupants of other buildings which spread the riot throughout most of the city. A carriage was waiting outside of the courthouse to deliver news of the verdict to Kalakaua, who was waiting at his home, but before the electoral committee could tell the driver, the mob tore it apart. Kalakaua's followers put up little to no resistance and the decision was made to consult with the American Minister Henry A. Peirce who requested aid from the United States Navy and Royal Navy commanders at the island. The two American sloops-of-war, USS Tuscarora and USS Portsmouth were anchored in Honolulu Harbor, on an expedition of negotiation to allow the exportation of sugar to America duty-free, but instead their commanders agreed to intervene in a major civil disturbance.[5]\n",

Cooper and former judge Sanford B. Dole as the designated President of Hawaii. It replaced the Kingdom of Hawaii after the overthrow of Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani as a provisional government until the Republic of Hawaii was established on July 4, 1894.\nFollowing the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, the coup leaders established the Provisional Government and set out to effect Hawaii's speedy annexation by the United States. The provisional government sent a commission including Lorrin A. Thurston to the U.S. and negotiated a treaty with President Benjamin Harrison that was quickly sent to the U.S. Senate for approval. At the same time Princess Victoria Ka\u02bbiulani was in Washington D.C. to campaign for the monarchist side and against the coup, which she decried as illegal.\nShortly after assuming office in March 1893, President Grover Cleveland, himself an anti-imperialist, withdrew the treaty and ordered a congressional investigation into the events surrounding the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. After receiving the committee's official report (that July), Cleveland stated that the U.S. had unlawfully used military force and called for the reinstatement of Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani. The matter was referred by Cleveland to Congress after Sanford Dole refused Cleveland's demands, and the U.S. Senate held an unofficial investigation, culminating in the Morgan Report,[2] which completely rejected that there had been any U.S. involvement in the overthrow. After the findings of this committee were submitted, Cleveland reiterated his position, and denounced the Provisional Government as being neither de facto or de jure.\n",

After Queen Lili`uokalani was overthrown[1] in a coup by the Committee Of Safety, he ran afoul of the government of the Republic of Hawaii and was accused of treason. Later he was instrumental in the development of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park.\nHe was born in 1858 in Vassaras (near Sparta, Greece). After his release from the Greek Army, his father decided to leave the family farm to an older brother and agreed to send George to America to join his eldest brother John, in California. In 1877 he traveled in steerage class to New York City, and worked his way across the country.[2]\nA relative convinced him to join a wholesale fruit business trading between Hawaii and California in 1881. In San Francisco he shipped California produce and wine to his cousin in Honolulu, who shipped Hawaiian bananas to the mainland. Through friends he learned of a small oyster house that was for sale in Sausalito and he was able to buy it.  He named it the Oyster Grotto.[3]  By 1881, the Grotto came to be patronized by such notables as William Randolph Hearst and the sons of the sugar cane baron, Claus Spreckels. He became friends with the sons of Claus Spreckels, whose family owned the Oceanic Steamship Company and a sugar cane business in Hawaii.\nIn 1889 he was supervising shipment being loaded at the docks, when some of the Spreckels family invited him on board for a poker game. By the time he noticed, the ship was on its way across the Pacific. He spent only a week in Hawaii, but must have enjoyed the stay, since he took more trips and spent more time on the islands.\nIn 1892 he sent for his nephew Demosthenes Lycurgus, who would help him manage his Hawaiian enterprises. Along with other recent immigrants, he formed the Pearl City Fruit Company. Their competition was the Hawaiian Fruit and Packing Company, owned by established descendants of American missionaries such as Lorrin A. Thurston, who was also a powerful politician. Eventually he would sell his restaurant in San Francisco and move to the islands.[4]\n",

In 1810, the whole Hawaiian archipelago became unified when Kaua\u02bbi and Ni\u02bbihau joined the Hawaiian Kingdom voluntarily. Two major dynastic families ruled the kingdom: the House of Kamehameha and the House of Kal\u0101kaua.\nThe kingdom won recognition from the major European powers. The United States became its chief trading partner and watched over it to prevent other powers (such as Britain and Japan) from asserting hegemony. In 1887 King Kal\u0101kaua was forced to accept a new constitution in a coup by the Honolulu Rifles, an anti-monarchist militia. Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani, who succeeded Kal\u0101kaua in 1891, tried to abrogate the new constitution. She was overthrown in 1893, largely at the hands of the Committee of Safety, a group including Hawaiian subjects and resident foreign nationals of American, British and German descent, many educated in the US.[12] Hawai\u02bbi was briefly an independent republic until the U.S. illegally annexed it through the Newlands Resolution on July 4, 1898, which created the Territory of Hawai\u02bbi. United States Public Law 103-150 of 1993 (known as the Apology Resolution), acknowledged that \"the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States\" and also \"that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bbi or through a plebiscite or referendum.\" \n",

Despite the damage to the aircraft, Captain James E. \"Skipper\" O'Halloran III, of Spokane, Washington, was able to land in Honolulu safely. One person was killed while 284 survived; 16 of them were wounded.[2]\nAt the time of the explosion, the aircraft was approximately 225 kilometers (140\u00a0mi; 121\u00a0nmi) northwest of Hawaii, cruising at 36,000 feet (11,000\u00a0m) with 270 passengers and 15 crew on board.[3] The bomb, which had been placed under a seat cushion, killed 16 year-old Toru Ozawa, a Japanese national. The blast also injured 16 other people (including Ozawa's parents) and caused damage to the floor and ceiling. The aircraft remained airborne and made an emergency landing in Honolulu with no further loss of life.\nThe bomb was placed by Mohammed Rashed, a Jordanian linked to the 15 May Organization. In 1988, he was arrested in Greece, tried, convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was paroled in 1996 after serving eight years. He was later extradited to the US from Egypt in 1998 to stand trial. In 2006, as part of a plea bargain agreement he was sentenced to a further seven years in federal prison. As per his agreement with US prosecutors in providing information about other terrorist plots, he was released from prison in March 2013 but as of March\u00a02014[update] still remained in a federal immigration detention facility in upstate New York awaiting deportation.[4] Rashed was relocated to Mauritania in November 2016.[5]\n",

He became a political statesman and orator during the final years of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the beginnings of the Territory of Hawaii. Despite being a leading Native Hawaiian politician in this era, his legacy has been largely forgotten or portrayed in a negative light, mainly because of a reliance on English-language sources to write Hawaiian history. He was known by the nickname of \"Pila Aila\" or \"Bila Aila\" (translated as Oily Bill) for his oratory skills.[1][2]\nBorn in Lahaina, Maui, of mixed Native Hawaiian and English descent, White was descended from Kaiakea, a legendary orator for King Kamehameha I. Representing Lahaina in the legislative assemblies of 1890 and 1892, he became a political leader for the Liberal faction in the government and established himself as a leader in the opposition to the unpopular Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Throughout the terms of both legislatures, White led attempts to pass bills calling for a constitutional convention. He was criticized by the missionary Reform party for his support of the controversial lottery and opium bills. He and  Joseph N\u0101wah\u012b co-authored the proposed 1893 Constitution with Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani. They were decorated Knight Commanders of the Royal Order of Kal\u0101kaua for their service and contribution to the monarchy. When an attempt by the queen to promulgate this constitution failed on January\u00a014, 1893, White's opponents falsely alleged he had tried to incite the people to storm \u02bbIolani Palace and harm the queen and her ministers. White denied these charges and threatened to sue the newspapers. Three days after the attempted promulgation, the queen was deposed in a coup during the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January\u00a017, 1893.\n",

He was considered a royalist and dedicated to the monarchy of the Kingdom of Hawaii.  Wilcox's revolts were part of the Hawaiian Rebellions.\nThe plot was to overthrow King David Kal\u0101kaua, king of Hawaii, and replace him with his sister in a coup d'\u00e9tat.\nIn 1887, in response to increased political tension between the legislature and the king, a group of government ministers led by Interior Minister Lorrin A. Thurston with the support of the Honolulu Rifles, forced King David Kal\u0101kaua to promulgate the Bayonet Constitution. The constitution stripped Asians of their voting rights while at the same time limited suffrage to wealthy Native Hawaiians, Americans and other Europeans. The king's own powers were limited substantially. Hostilities grew over the new constitution that limited mostly non-white commoners' rights and power. Kal\u0101kaua's sister, Princess Lili\u02bbuokalani and wife, Queen Kapiolani returned from Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee immediately after news reached them in Great Britain.[1]\n",

He founded the Republican Party in Maine and served as Maine State Senator.\nJohn Leavitt Stevens was born in 1820 in the town of Mount Vernon, Kennebec County, Maine, to Capt. John Stevens [2] and Charlotte (Lyford) Stevens.[3][4]  He was a lifelong resident of Augusta in the same county, except for his time away at school and his later diplomatic service.[5]  Stevens attended Maine Wesleyan Seminary to prepare for a minister's career in the Universalist church, which he served as pastor for a decade, becoming a leader in the anti-slavery movement. (Stevens later became a firm opponent of capital punishment, and as a Maine State Senator urged the legislature to abolish the death penalty).[6]\nAfter a decade as an activist Universalist minister, Stevens was persuaded by his lifelong friend Maine Governor Anson P.

Following the overthrow of the monarchy on January 17, 1893, Hawaii's provisional government\u2014under the leadership of Sanford B. Dole\u2014attempted to annex the land to the United States under Republican Benjamin Harrison's administration.  But the treaty of annexation came up for approval under the administration of Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, anti-expansionist, and friend of the deposed Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii. Cleveland retracted the treaty on March 4, 1893, and launched an investigation headed by James Henderson Blount; its report is known as the Blount Report.\nThe overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom was a result of progressive governmental control by foreigners and their descendants who were coming in increasing numbers to the islands of Hawaii. Many of these foreigners bought Hawaiian land and invested in the lucrative Hawaiian sugar industry. In 1887, these men forced the then reigning king, Kal\u0101kaua, to sign the so-called Bayonet Constitution, which stripped him of much of his power, in turn creating a constitutional monarchy. In 1890, the United States enacted the McKinley Tariff; the new law sharply raised the country's import tariffs, ending the Hawaiian sugar industry's dominance in the North American market and depressing prices, pushing Hawaii into turmoil.[2][3]\nFollowing the sugar crash, in 1893 the reigning Queen Lili'uokalani proposed a new constitution to replace the 1887 one. If adopted, the new constitution would revoke many of the foreigners' powers, and put the queen back in control of the Kingdom. The proposal was backed by the majority of the native population; however, it was naturally opposed by the Americans and other foreigners.  Hoping for American intervention, they began planning a coup. Anti-monarchists coalesced, forming the Committee of Safety while royalist leaders formed the Committee of Law and Order in support of the queen and the government.[4]\nThe situation soon escalated as both sides armed themselves. Fearing for American safety, the United States called on USS\u00a0Boston to land a small force of Marines to protect American interests. Although the Americans were sworn to neutrality and never fired a shot, they did intimidate the royalist defenders, and Queen Lili'uokalani, fearing bloodshed, conceded.[3][5][6]\n",

The namesake came from Dr. James Morgan, who built his villa on the inside of the bend in the 1920s.[1] Wilder's house was opposite Morgan's, south of the bend.\nAt the time of the murder the area was a semirural rainforest. Petty criminals James Majors (19) and John Palakiko (21) escaped a prison work crew on March 10, 1948.

However, a few weeks after the event, he was found to have murdered his former girlfriend prior to the crisis.[1]\nThe incident began just before 7:00\u00a0a.m. on February 6, 1996, when 28-year-old John Nahale Miranda burst into the Seal Masters of Hawaii building. The company was a waterproofing business that was based in Sand Island, Honolulu. Miranda had previously worked at the building as an employee but had been fired eight months prior to the crisis. Miranda was enraged over having no money or job; he had also accused company officials of racism and firing him solely because he was Hawaiian/Puerto Rican. Miranda had armed himself with a sawed-off shotgun and a knife. As he made entry, Miranda demanded twenty-thousand dollars in cash from the company.[2] The company owner, Harry Lee, prepared to accept the deal, but Lee's wife insisted on calling the police instead. As the call was made, Miranda took five employees who were working in the building hostage. One of them was his former supervisor and vice president of the company, 59-year-old Guy George. George had been the one to personally fire Miranda at the time of his dismissal. Miranda then opened fire with his sawed-off shotgun and shot George once in the leg. George suffered a serious gunshot wound to his right leg, and nearly half of it was blown off.[3]\n",

He was a British citizen since Canada was a territory of the United Kingdom. He became a Quartermaster Sergeant in the Grizwold Light Cavalry during the American Civil War. After the Civil War, Ashford, became a surveyor for the Beaverton railway and joined the Prince of Wales' Canadian Dragoons where he made Captain.[2] He was widowed twice in addition to the death of his daughter.  In 1884 his brother and future Attorney General of Hawaii, Clarence W. Ashford, invited him to visit Honolulu. After moving to Hawaii he joined the Honolulu Rifles, a militia. Ashford became responsible for the Rifles' growth from 100 men in 1886 to a battalion of three companies in 1887 and recognition as a paramilitary force. He rapidly moved up the ranks entering with his Canadian rank of Captain, he rose through Major and Lieutenant Colonel becoming Colonel in 1887, the highest rank and commander of the Rifles itself.\nShortly after becoming Colonel, a group of conspirators within the Missionary Party wanted to annex Hawaii to the United States. Ashford believed the monarchy was corrupt and was recruited to what would be known as the Hawaiian League. The Hawaiian League used the Rifles in the Rebellion of 1887 a bloodless revolution to enact the Bayonet Constitution. In 1889 the Rifles did battle with forces of Robert Wilcox in the Wilcox Rebellion. Upon Wilcox's surrender, he offered Ashford his sabre, he accepted the surrender but turned down the sabre. Ashford began to regret his support for the Hawaiian League. He came to believe that the League was more corrupt than the monarchy at advancing their own interests rather than improving Hawaii. He joined the Liberal Party, a third party that supported neither the Monarchy nor the Missionaries. Ashford was arrested in a plot to overthrown both the Monarchy and Bayonet Constitution known as the Burlesque Conspiracy and went into exile. His brother took his place in his absence as commander of the Honolulu Rifles. After the Overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, Ashford returned to Hawaii and retired from his position as commander of the Rifles. He was a strong supporter of annexation, but with the establishment of the Republic of Hawaii he gave little support for the new government which he believed was corrupt and later revealed at his military tribunal, disapproved of the mistreatment of Hawaiians by the government.  Ashford was approached by counter-revolutionaries as a consultant to restore the monarchy.\n",

Joseph Ballard Atherton joined as a clerk in 1858 and rose to become a partner by 1865.[2] Over the next few decades, the company invested heavily in Hawaii's sugar industry, running plantations in Kohala and Haiku.

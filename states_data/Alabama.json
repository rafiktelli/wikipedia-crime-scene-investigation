On December 3, the trio was found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in Southern legal history.\nRowe testified that Wilkins had fired two shots into Liuzzo on the order of Thomas,[citation needed] and was placed in the witness protection program by the FBI.[3] In an effort to deflect attention from having employed Rowe as an informant, the FBI produced disinformation[4][5] for politicians and the press, stating that Liuzzo was a member of the Communist Party, heroin addict,[6] and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African-Americans involved in the Civil Rights Movement.[7] Liuzzo's involvement in the civil rights movement was scrutinized and she was condemned by various racist organizations.

While participating in the Selma to Montgomery marches actions in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, he was murdered by white segregationists, dying of head injuries in the hospital two days after being severely beaten. Three men were tried for Reeb's murder but were acquitted by an all-white jury. His murder remains officially unsolved.\nReeb was born on January 1, 1927, in Wichita, Kansas, to Mae (Fox) and Harry Reeb.[1][2] He was raised in Kansas and Casper, Wyoming.[3]  He attended Natrona County High School and graduated in 1945, after which he joined the Army despite the fact that his commitment to the ministry made him exempt from service. After basic training, he was sent to Anchorage, Alaska, as a clerk typist for the headquarters of Special Troops. He was honorably discharged eighteen months later in December 1946 as Technical Sergeant, Third Class.[4] After his time in the Army, Reeb continued his schooling. Initially, he attended classes in his home town at Casper Junior College, before moving on to St. Olaf College, in 1947, where he received his A.B. cum laude in 1950.[5] He then entered Princeton Theological Seminary in Princeton, New Jersey,[6] where he earned his B.D. in 1953.[4] Three days later, Reeb was ordained a Presbyterian minister at the First Presbyterian Church of Casper.[7] After this he accepted a position at the Philadelphia General Hospital as Chaplain to Hospitals for the Philadelphia Presbyter. To become a more effective counselor, he went back to school, enrolling at Conwell School of Theology, where he earned an S.T.M. in Pastoral Counseling in 1955.[4]\n"

While locally-told stories of his life usually say that he was hanged on trumped-up charges of desertion from the Confederate Army, other sources show that he was killed for allegedly aiding pro-Union renegades in the area.  Whatever the reason for his murder, a shallow hole dug beneath Sketoe's feet during the hanging (to accommodate his large frame) ultimately led to stories about \"the hole that won't stay filled.\"  According to witnesses, this hole never disappeared\u2014even after being filled numerous times\u2014retaining its original dimensions for the next 125 years.\nSketoe's tale became a staple of Southern folklore, and was later immortalized by Alabama author Kathryn Tucker Windham in her 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey.  His hanging site remained a local tourist attraction for decades, and continues to attract visitors even though the hole itself recently disappeared due to flooding in the area.  Today the site of Sketoe's lynching lies beneath the Alabama Highway 134 bridge over the Choctawhatchee River, and a monument to Sketoe has been erected nearby.\n"

In March 1965, Liuzzo heeded the call of Martin Luther King Jr. and traveled from Detroit, Michigan, to Selma, Alabama, in the wake of the Bloody Sunday attempt at marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Liuzzo participated in the successful Selma to Montgomery marches and helped with coordination and logistics. At the age of 39, while driving back from a trip shuttling fellow activists to the Montgomery airport, she was fatally hit by shots fired from a pursuing car containing Ku Klux Klan members Collie Wilkins, William Eaton, Eugene Thomas, and Gary Thomas Rowe, the last of whom was actually an undercover informant working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).[1][2] Although the State of Alabama was unable to secure a murder conviction, Wilkins, Eaton, and Thomas were charged in federal court with conspiracy to intimidate African Americans under the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act, a Reconstruction civil rights statute. On December 3, the trio was found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in Southern legal history.\nRowe testified that Wilkins had fired two shots into Liuzzo on the order of Thomas,[citation needed] and was placed in the witness protection program by the FBI.[3] In an effort to deflect attention from having employed Rowe as an informant, the FBI produced disinformation[4][5] for politicians and the press, stating that Liuzzo was a member of the Communist Party, heroin addict,[6] and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African-Americans involved in the Civil Rights Movement.[7] Liuzzo's involvement in the civil rights movement was scrutinized and she was condemned by various racist organizations. In 1983, the Liuzzo family filed a lawsuit against the FBI after learning about the FBI's activities, but the suit was dismissed.\n"

Whatever the reason for his murder, a shallow hole dug beneath Sketoe's feet during the hanging (to accommodate his large frame) ultimately led to stories about \"the hole that won't stay filled.\"  According to witnesses, this hole never disappeared\u2014even after being filled numerous times\u2014retaining its original dimensions for the next 125 years.\nSketoe's tale became a staple of Southern folklore, and was later immortalized by Alabama author Kathryn Tucker Windham in her 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey.

On December 3, the trio was found guilty by an all-white, all-male jury, and were sentenced to ten years in prison, a landmark in Southern legal history.\nRowe testified that Wilkins had fired two shots into Liuzzo on the order of Thomas,[citation needed] and was placed in the witness protection program by the FBI.[3] In an effort to deflect attention from having employed Rowe as an informant, the FBI produced disinformation[4][5] for politicians and the press, stating that Liuzzo was a member of the Communist Party, heroin addict,[6] and had abandoned her children to have sexual relationships with African-Americans involved in the Civil Rights Movement.[7] Liuzzo's involvement in the civil rights movement was scrutinized and she was condemned by various racist organizations. In 1983, the Liuzzo family filed a lawsuit against the FBI after learning about the FBI's activities, but the suit was dismissed.\n"

He teaches her and her friend Rachel (Stephanie Zandra Peyton) that when asked, \"Children, what do you want?\" their answer should be \"Freedom.\" He also teaches her that everyone deserves to be treated with fairness, regardless of the color of their skin, and that children also have a battle to fight. Sheyann wants to get involved and skips school to sneak into the meetings. One night a friend of Sheyann's named Jimmie Lee Jackson is killed. To draw attention to the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson, it is decided that a 54-mile march to the state capital of Alabama will take place. Marchers will present a petition to Governor Wallace to protest that Negroes are not being treated fairly.

Affiliates such as the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and the Lowndes County Freedom Organization in Alabama also worked to increase the pressure on federal and state government to enforce constitutional protections.\nBy the mid-1960s the measured nature of the gains made, and the violence with which they were resisted, were generating dissent from the group's principles of nonviolence, of white participation in the movement, and of field-driven, as opposed to national-office, leadership and direction. At the same time some original organizers were now working with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and others were being lost to a de-segregating Democratic Party and to federally-funded anti-poverty programs.

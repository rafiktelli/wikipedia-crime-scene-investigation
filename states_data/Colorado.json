After the shooting, Griffin became a fugitive from justice for six years, but after she was profiled on Fox's America's Most Wanted, Griffin was captured in El Cajon, California, a suburb of San Diego, in June 2005.[1]\nMalaika Tamu Griffin was born in Mississippi on May 11, 1971.[2] In 1999, she moved to Denver, Colorado, where she was working in a pharmacy and was renting a room in a house next door to a white couple: Jason Patrick Horsley and his girlfriend Deborah Loiselle. Horsley was a carpenter, and Griffin became angry when she laid his tools on the sidewalk in front of her house after work. A bitter argument ensued on May 18, 1999.[3]\nAfter this argument, Griffin returned to her apartment and came out with a 9mm handgun with a laser sight and shot Horsley point blank in the back, killing him instantly.[4] Immediately after the incident, she fled to the nearby home of an acquaintance, Monique Thomas. Griffin stole Thomas' car at gunpoint and then drove away. The car was later found abandoned in Iowa City, Iowa.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "Columbine is a non-fiction book written by Dave Cullen and published by Twelve (Hachette Book Group) on April 6, 2009. It is an examination of the Columbine High School massacre, on April 20, 1999, and the perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.[1] The book covers two major storylines: the killer's evolution leading up to the attack, and the survivors' struggles with the aftermath over the next decade. Chapters alternate between the two stories. Graphic depictions of parts of the attack are included, in addition to the actual names of friends and family (the only exception being the pseudonym \"Harriet\", which is used for a female Columbine student referred to in Klebold\u2019s journal entries, with whom he was obsessively in love).\nCullen says he spent ten years researching and writing the book. He previously contributed to The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Times of London, and The Guardian. He is best known for his work for Slate and Salon.com. His Slate story \"The Depressive and the Psychopath\" five years earlier, offered the first diagnosis of the killers by the team of psychologists and psychiatrists brought into the case by the FBI.[2] Publication was timed to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the massacre, which occurred on April 20, 1999. The book spent eight weeks on The New York Times bestseller list in the spring of 2009, peaking at #3.[3][4]\nThe book gained considerable media attention for addressing many of the so-called Columbine myths widely taken for granted. According to the book, the massacre had nothing to do with school bullying, jocks, the Gothic subculture, Marilyn Manson or the Trench Coat Mafia.[5] Cullen also writes that the attack was intended primarily as a bombing rather than a school shooting, and that Harris and Klebold intended to perpetrate the worst terrorist attack in American history. The book garnered glowing reviews from Time, Newsweek, People, The New York Observer and Entertainment Weekly.[6] One of the few dissenting views came from Janet Maslin, who wrote in The New York Times, \"What good can a new book on Columbine do? Mr. Cullen's Salon coverage had already refuted some of the worst misconceptions about the story by the fall of 1999... Emerging details mostly corroborate what was already known.\"[7]\n",

His family was Jewish.[2] He attended the University of Colorado Denver before transferring to the University of Denver. At age 22, Berg was one of the youngest people to pass the Illinois state bar examination and he went into practice in Chicago. However, he began to experience neuromuscular seizures and had become an alcoholic.[2] His then-wife, Judith Lee Berg (n\u00e9e Halpern), convinced him to quit his practice to seek help. They moved to Denver, her hometown, and he entered rehabilitation voluntarily. Although he completed his treatment, he continued to be plagued by seizures. He was ultimately diagnosed with a brain tumor. After it was surgically removed, he made a full recovery.[2] For the rest of his life, Berg wore long bangs to hide the surgical scars.\n",

He is a skilled forger who, while he ran a legitimate business buying and selling organic beef, primarily enriched himself by passing bad checks on the accounts of others and using forged documents; by 2003 he had faced criminal charges in four Western states. These white-collar crimes also enabled his murders, by allowing him to create evidence that his victims were still alive after he had killed them; he also used their checking accounts and credit cards to further his schemes once they were dead.\n",

The placer gold in the area soon played out, but hard rock deposits of gold were found in the mountains to the west. Some of the miners abandoned their search for gold and returned to farm the rich bottom land along Ralston Creek and Clear Creek. They found an eager market for their crops among other gold seekers.

He was inspired to create a video game about Columbine by his own experience being bullied and the effect the shooting had on his life. The game represents a critique of how traditional media sensationalized the shooting, as well as parodying video games themselves. Super Columbine Massacre was created with ASCII's game development program RPG Maker 2000 and took approximately six months to complete. Ledonne initially published the game anonymously, releasing an artist's statement about the work after his identity was revealed. Super Columbine Massacre was released for free online and attracted little attention until 2006, when widespread media coverage fueled hundreds of thousands of downloads.\n",

A search of the backpack later recovered duct tape, handcuffs, knives, a stun gun, rope, scissors, massage oil, sex toys, and numerous rounds of ammunition, but no explosives.[1]\nA sixteen-year-old student named Katrina Keller reportedly saw Morrison entering the school before the time specified by police. She stated that she had been walking past a vacant classroom and saw a man inside wearing a hooded sweatshirt, apparently angry. Keller did not report the incident to the school office.[8] Other students reported that they witnessed Morrison sitting in a yellow Jeep in the school parking lot at around 10:45\u00a0a.m., almost an hour before he entered the school. Morrison was believed to have been living in the car, camping out near Bailey.[9] Videos taken from security cameras outside show that Morrison was in his Jeep for at least 20 minutes, mingling with students as classes changed, 35 minutes before the siege began.

Outside the United States, \"The Way I Am\" peaked within the top ten of the charts in Belgium (Wallonia), Finland, Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, and United Kingdom.\nThe song was written by Eminem to express the negative side of the fame that he had gained. The song makes points such as him not being able to go out in public and live a normal life due to him being harassed by fans. He also vents about the pressure put on him to top his earlier work on The Slim Shady LP. The song has also been remixed by Danny Lohner featuring Marilyn Manson, who has performed the song with Eminem live on stage. In 2005, it was re-released on the album Curtain Call: The Hits. \"The Way I Am\" was certified Gold in Sweden, selling over 20,000 copies.[2]\nIn 2008, Eminem released a second autobiography titled The Way I Am.\n",

Vincent's parents were law-abiding, average citizens who took good care of their children. Groves attended Wheat Ridge High School, which he graduated in 1972, the only black student from his class.[3] One of his classmates was Dave Logan, who would later become a prominent professional football player and coach.[4][5]\nWith a tall and athletic physique, Vincent spent his high school years as a member of the school's basketball team, achieving outstanding results on the court. In 1972, his team reached the final in the annual interscholastic basketball championship in the state, with Groves being recognized as the team's star player, thanks to which he was popular and had many friends and acquaintances. After school, he entered Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he played for the local basketball team. However, he quickly lost interest in studying and sports, and in 1974, due to his chronic absences, he dropped out of college and returned to Denver. He moved in with his grandmother and found a job as an electrician at the Gates Rubber Company. In his free time, Groves was fond of drinking alcohol and visiting the red-light districts, as a result of which, in the late 1970s, he spent a lot of time surrounded by pimps and prostitutes, and subsequently began leading a criminal lifestyle.[6]\n",

The district is headquartered at the Jeffco Public Schools Education Center in West Pleasant View, an unincorporated area of the county near Golden in the Denver metropolitan area.[4][5] Jeffco Public Schools serves almost  81,000 students in 166 schools. It is the second-largest school district in Colorado, having been surpassed in 2013 by Denver Public Schools, which has an enrollment of approximately 81,000.\nThe district covers the entirety of Jefferson County,[6] and also includes a section of Broomfield.[7]\nThe first school in Jefferson County and the second school in Colorado opened in Golden on January 9, 1860. It stood at around today's 1304 Washington Avenue and was a rented log cabin, with school taught by Thomas Daughterty, with 18 students, financed through tuition and subscription. Its second term was taught by Miss M. F. Manly. When Jefferson County was organized by the Territorial government in 1861, the capability of organizing public schools became reality, and George West became the first superintendent of Jefferson County schools. After a mill levy was created in 1862, the first two school districts, Golden and Vasquez (roughly today's Wheat Ridge/Arvada area), were organized in 1863. That September the first public school in the county opened in Golden.[8]\n",

It stars Kelly Blatz, Daryl Sabara, Ellen Woglom, Illeana Douglas, Janel Parrish, and Tom Arnold. It is based on the Columbine High School shootings, of which Robinson is a survivor. The film was shot at Plattsmouth High School in Plattsmouth, Nebraska, in May 2008.[1]\nIn the aftermath of a school shooting, several survivors have evacuated to the elementary school to wait for more survivors to arrive. A senior named Sean Ryan calls his friend Vicki at a coffee shop, who tells him that the shooter is Ben Harris, a friend of Sean's. Sean is left speechless.\nThat morning, before the massacre begins, a student named Jason is being bullied and is struggling to pick up his books, but then Sean helps him. Sean reminds Jason that school is almost over and that he shouldn't let the bullying get to him. The two then go into their school, Jefferson High School; both are seniors there. It is a Monday, and Sean, his best friend Nick, and a few other students, are working on the school play. Sean learns that his friend Ben Harris, who works the lights, is absent, so Jason substitutes for him.\n",

Almost none of the information he gave the bureau was of any use in prosecuting other crimes, and much of it later proved false; the case greatly embarrassed the bureau. The agent who oversaw him during this period was disciplined; he insists he was not the only one responsible for enabling Kimball.[3]\nKimball was sexually abused in his teens, which led to a suicide attempt and a life of crime. He is a skilled forger who, while he ran a legitimate business buying and selling organic beef, primarily enriched himself by passing bad checks on the accounts of others and using forged documents; by 2003 he had faced criminal charges in four Western states. These white-collar crimes also enabled his murders, by allowing him to create evidence that his victims were still alive after he had killed them; he also used their checking accounts and credit cards to further his schemes once they were dead.\n",

The primary nature of Davidson's business consisted of providing promotional services for companies by sending large volumes of unsolicited commercial electronic messages (\"spamming\"). The spamming was designed to promote the visibility and sale of products offered by various companies. Davidson utilized the services and assistance of other individuals whom he hired as \"sub-contractors\" to provide spamming at his direction on behalf of his client companies.\nThroughout 2002 through the middle of 2005, Davidson's spamming activities were provided on behalf of companies to promote watches, perfume, and other items. Beginning in the middle of 2005 through 2006, Davidson sent spam on behalf of a Texas company for purposes of promoting the sale of the company's stock. The company generated its income through selling low-value stock on behalf of small companies on the public market. Davidson, aided by several sub-spammers, sent hundreds of thousands of unsolicited e-mail messages to potential purchasers throughout the United States and the world, which messages touted the penny stock as an excellent investment. Davidson possessed hundreds of thousands of e-mail addresses, which he and his sub-spammers would use to send e-mail messages. Such e-mail messages contained false header information, which concealed the actual sender from the recipient of the e-mail. Davidson provided spammed messages for approximately 19 companies. Davidson operated his spamming activities from his personal residence in Bennett, Colorado, where he had a large network of computers and servers, which facilitated his business.\nDavidson was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 5, 2007 for violating the CAN SPAM Act. He pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court before Judge Marcia S. Krieger on December 3, 2007. On April 28, 2008, Davidson was sentenced by Krieger to serve 21 months in federal prison. Judge Krieger also ordered him to pay $714,139 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). As part of the restitution, Davis agreed to forfeit property, including gold coins, which he purchased with the proceeds of his activities. At the time of sentencing Judge Krieger ordered Davidson to report to a facility designated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons on May 27, 2008.\n",

To date, no one else has been charged with Hettrick's murder.\nOn the morning of February 11, 1987, a bicyclist investigated what he thought was a mannequin and discovered the dead body of 37-year-old Peggy Hettrick in a field in southern Fort Collins. According to the coroner, she died from a single stab wound in the upper left back, likely very early in the morning. Her body had been \"sexually mutilated,\" with the precise removal of her left nipple and areola, as well as a female \"circumcision\",[3] including what one doctor described as a partial vulvectomy; a procedure that requires high skill and quality surgical equipment to perform.[4]\nBefore the bicyclist found the body, 15-year-old Timothy Masters saw it while walking to school at daybreak. Thinking it was a mannequin left as a prank, Masters did not report the body to the police. After Masters' father Clyde Masters told canvassing police that he had seen his son deviate from his usual path across the field to the bus that morning, police pulled Masters, then a 5\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (1.78\u00a0m)-tall, 120\u00a0lb (54\u00a0kg) high school sophomore nicknamed \"Toothpick\", out of class for questioning.\n",

Despite being less well-known than his fellow gang members, he has since been referred to as \"the wildest of the Wild Bunch\",[1] having reputedly killed at least nine law enforcement officers in five shootings and another two men in other instances. He was involved in numerous shootouts with police and civilians and participated in several bank and train robberies with various gangs during his outlaw days.\nLogan was born in Richland Township, Tama County, Iowa in 1867. His mother died in 1876, and his brothers, Hank, Johnny and Lonny, moved to Dodson, Missouri to live with their aunt Lee Logan. Until at least 1883, Harvey made his living breaking horses on the Cross L ranch, near Rising Star, Texas. While there, he met and befriended a man named \"Flat Nose\" George Curry, from whom he took his new last name. His brothers soon adopted the same last name. The Logan brothers were known as hard workers until they got paid. Money did not stay in their pockets for long. They all had a taste for alcohol and women. Kid Curry would often return from a train or bank robbery, get drunk and lay up with prostitutes until his share of the take was gone. After Kid Curry became famous, the prostitutes would frequently name him as the father when they became pregnant. The children were referred to as \"Curry Kids\". It is believed that Kid Curry was credited with as many as eighty-five children,[citation needed] though the number of children he actually fathered was probably fewer than five. Descendants of the \"Curry Kids\" remain scattered throughout Eastland County, Texas and the surrounding areas to this day.\nIn 1883, Curry rode as a cowboy on a cattle drive to Pueblo, Colorado. While in Pueblo, he was involved in a saloon brawl. To avoid arrest, he fled, settling in southern Wyoming, where he began work at the \"Circle Diamond\" ranch. By all accounts, when sober, Curry was mild-mannered, likable, and loyal to both his friends and brothers.\n",

He killed eight people and wounded one person in the toe before shooting himself in the head; twelve others were also injured by flying glass or sprained ankles.[4] Auvinen died later that evening in a Helsinki hospital.\nThis was the second school shooting in the history of Finland. The previous incident occurred in 1989 at the Raumanmeri school in Rauma, when a 14-year-old fatally shot two fellow students.[5] Less than one year after the Jokela school massacre, the Kauhajoki school shooting occurred, which is thought to have been heavily inspired by Auvinen.\nAt approximately 11:40 (09:40 UTC), Pekka-Eric Auvinen entered Jokela High School's ground-floor main hallway, having missed his first lesson. He encountered a student in the corridor and killed him at 11:42, then moved to the lavatories. Soon after, other students found the victim's body but assumed he was rendered unconscious from a bump to his head. Other students heard the sound of gunshots but did not recognise them. At the lavatories, Auvinen fatally shot two more students, prompting the school nurse to call emergency services. After shooting and killing a student outside the lavatory, Auvinen ran after the nurse, caught up to her, and fatally shot her and another student at 11:46.[4]\n",

Gill briefly took a passerby hostage and forced him to carry a bag containing a fourth gun and additional ammunition. Gill opened fire at students outside on the steps of Dawson College at its rear entrance with a semi-automatic carbine, and the passerby fled the melee, leaving Gill's bag.[7]\n",

Watts initially maintained his innocence in his family\u2019s disappearance, but was arrested on August 15 after confessing to murdering Shanann in an interview with detectives. He later admitted to murdering his children.\nOn November 6, 2018, Watts pleaded guilty to multiple counts of first-degree murder as part of a plea deal when the death penalty (which was later abolished in Colorado in 2020) was removed from sentencing. He was sentenced to five life sentences without the possibility of parole, three to be served consecutively.\nChristopher Lee Watts and Shanann Cathryn Watts (n\u00e9e Rzucek, January 10, 1984 \u2013 August 13, 2018) were from North Carolina: Christopher from Spring Lake and Shanann from Aberdeen. They met in 2010 and were married in Mecklenburg County on November 3, 2012, according to online records.[2] The couple had two daughters: Bella Marie Watts (December 17, 2013 \u2013 August 13, 2018) and Celeste Cathryn \"CeCe\" Watts (July 17, 2015 \u2013 August 13, 2018).

The book details the childhood and teenage years of her son, and what she says are signs she missed that Dylan was suffering from clinical depression. The book also examines her grieving process in dealing with the fallout of the massacre.[3]\nIn his foreword to the book, author Andrew Solomon wrote, \u201cThe ultimate message of this book is terrifying: you may not know your own children, and worse yet, your children may be unknowable to you. The stranger you fear may be your own son or daughter.\u201d[4] Sue Klebold donated all of her profits from the book to mental health charities.[5]\nThe book describes Dylan Klebold as he grew into a teenager and his behaviors in the time leading up to the massacre, as well as Sue Klebold's desire to leave public attention after the massacre occurred.[6] Sue Klebold faced negative attitudes towards herself and faced stresses on her own family. She did not believe Dylan Klebold willingly partook in the attack until she viewed the videotapes he made with Eric Harris.[7] She ultimately decided to promote suicide prevention.[5] As reviewer Rachel Shteir notes, the book \u201cavoids details of the attack\u201d.[6] The book also describes the various media-related controversies, including bullying, copycatting, and the effect of violence on U.S. culture.[7] Sue Klebold often states that her son was depressive instead of psychopathic, and that compared to Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold allowed some victims to flee, as well as killed fewer people.[7]\n",

The song was included in \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's polka medley \"Angry White Boy Polka\" from his 2003 album Poodle Hat, despite lead singer Sonny Sandoval's mixed-race background.\nThe song's inspiration stems from a trip when the band was on their way to record for Satellite on March 5, 2001.

        "paragraph": "Phillip La Force Hutchinson (March 19, 1963 \u2013 February 9, 1988)[1] was an American bank robber, known for his 1988 rampage in Denver, Colorado, in which he robbed a bank, murdered a police officer and held a man hostage. He was chased by police and a news helicopter that filmed his getaway in one of the first ever recorded police chases. Hutchinson was eventually stopped when the pilot of the news helicopter landed it in front of his hijacked pickup truck. Hutchinson was then shot dead by police when they surrounded him. A film made in 1991 called The Chase was about his crime spree.[2]\nHutchinson was born in Arlington County, Virginia on March 19, 1963. He was described by authorities as a career criminal and was an escaped convict. Prior to the Denver bank robbery, he was serving a life sentence for an aggravated robbery in a Texas prison. According to the Texas Department of Corrections, he had escaped from prison on July 31, 1987, along with another inmate. Hutchinson's criminal record included kidnapping, two prison escapes and desertion from the Marine Corps. Authorities also believe he had possible involvement in four other bank robberies in the Denver area.[3]\nOn February 9, 1988, in Denver, Colorado, at around 11:20\u00a0a.m., Hutchinson entered the Rio Grande Operating Credit Union office armed with a handgun and robbed the teller at gunpoint. He then fled in a brown Chevrolet K5 Blazer at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. A KCNC-TV news helicopter that had been filming aerial shots for a local newscast was informed of the robbery and ensuing police chase. Hutchinson drove recklessly at high speeds and forced other vehicles off the road including police cruisers. Hutchinson fled northbound on Tennyson Street and headed directly towards an unmarked police cruiser. The two detectives inside the vehicle attempted to escape. Detective Robert \"Bob\" Wallis, who had been inside the vehicle, was struck by Hutchinson as he attempted to run across the street.[4] Wallis's body was sent flying and he was killed instantly. Hutchinson continued to flee and did not stop. He escaped from the police momentarily, but then crashed his Blazer into a tree after losing control of the vehicle. He then fled on foot with the stolen money and handgun to a nearby parking lot. Hutchinson then spotted a young woman with a baby in a blue car. He attempted to hijack the vehicle and use them as hostages, but the woman drove off before he could break into her vehicle. As she fled, Hutchinson opened fire with his handgun on the vehicle. He hit the car but missed hitting anyone inside. Hutchinson then fled to a nearby house where he encountered 73-year-old John Laurienti. He held him hostage at gunpoint and forced Laurienti to drive him in Laurienti's green Chevy pickup truck. Hutchinson threatened to kill Laurienti if he made any attempt to alert the police of his presence. By this point, only the news helicopter pilot, Mike Silva, and the cameraman, Jim Stair, knew of Hutchinson's present location. They were unable to get through to the police and inform them of where Hutchinson was located. As Laurienti drove past a police car, Hutchinson ducked down in the passenger seat and the pickup drove straight past the cruiser, with the police completely unaware he was in the vehicle.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nScott Lee Kimball (born September 21, 1966) is a convicted serial killer, con man and fraudster from Boulder County, Colorado, who murdered at least four people over a two-year period; investigators strongly suspect him in as many as 21 other unsolved killings.[1][2] For the first year of his murder activity, he worked as an informant for the FBI, which both paid him and protected him from facing justice over some of his fraud schemes. Almost none of the information he gave the bureau was of any use in prosecuting other crimes, and much of it later proved false; the case greatly embarrassed the bureau. The agent who oversaw him during this period was disciplined; he insists he was not the only one responsible for enabling Kimball.[3]\nKimball was sexually abused in his teens, which led to a suicide attempt and a life of crime. He is a skilled forger who, while he ran a legitimate business buying and selling organic beef, primarily enriched himself by passing bad checks on the accounts of others and using forged documents; by 2003 he had faced criminal charges in four Western states. These white-collar crimes also enabled his murders, by allowing him to create evidence that his victims were still alive after he had killed them; he also used their checking accounts and credit cards to further his schemes once they were dead.\n",

        "paragraph": "Duck! The Carbine High Massacre is a 1999 American teen black comedy crime film about a school shooting. Released just over six months after the Columbine High School massacre event, it was written, produced and directed by William Hellfire and Joey Smack, who also starred.[1][2]  After the film was released, Hellfire and Smack were arrested for possession of weapons on school property. The film is said to have helped pay for Hellfire's legal fees.[3][4][5]\nDerwin (William Hellfire) and Derick (Joey Smack) are trench coat-wearing neo-Nazis from deprived families. They find a website selling top secret missiles and order one with the credit card of Derick's mother. The next day at school they encounter the school janitor who warns them of their unusual wardrobe. They launch the missile the following day, but discover it is a dud. While walking home, Derwin is assaulted by jocks and left in critical condition where the janitor finds him. He and Derick both fail their presentation on the topic of the internet due to Derwin's absence. They then form a plan to kill students at their school and then commit suicide with the janitor\u2019s offered assistance. The pair buy two shotguns and several handguns from a black market dealer next door to a heavy metal band concert. He also offers them cocaine and sexual intercourse with an underage girl being held hostage, which they refuse. The next day the janitor arrives first with a propane bomb and leaves it in the cafeteria. Derwin and Derick appear and open fire in the cafeteria, killing several people before going to the basement where they simultaneously kill each other. The two die holding hands. A police officer (Karl Pitt) and the school principal (Larry Wellman) enter the school to find a bomb that was placed there by the janitor (Rodney Sleurtols). While the policeman attempts to defuse it, the janitor is seen running away to safety before the policeman accidentally sets the bomb off. The aftermath involves the parents along with a teacher and the principal sharing their thoughts on Derwin and Derick as well as the victims. A scientist then expresses his theory of alien influence as a motive, hinting the janitor was an alien.\n\"Duck\", along with other Factory 2000 films was edited in Adobe Premiere and shot on consumer-level VHS cameras including a broadcast Super VHS camcorder, a standard handheld RCA (specifically for filming multiple angles of the concert scene), and another unidentified camcorder. The film saw its first DVD release in 2004 along with minor color corrections. The film was produced with $3,000 and an inexperienced cast. Unlike previous films from Factory 2000, this film was based upon an actual event, and not mainly focused on fetishes.[1]  People who worked on the film received death threats. Director William Hellfire said that due to the painkillers he was using to treat his cancer pain, \"Like I don't remember most of Duck!, I don't remember... I shot all these films in a semi-subconscious, drugged-out, zombified state. I had no remorse nor regard for anything\"   [sic].[6]\n",

It is a stone building erected during the 1890s, from a design by Willoughby J. Edbrooke that blends elements of the Romanesque Revival and Italianate architectural styles. In 1972 it became the first property in the city to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the second in Pitkin County.[3][note 1] The upstairs auditorium hosts a number of events every year, ranging from nationally prominent music and comedy acts and some of the Aspen Music Festival's events to productions by local community groups.\nIt is one of two buildings in town named after early developer Jerome B. Wheeler. Originally, the opera house was located on the third floor, with retail space at street level and professional offices on the second floor. An early 20th-century arson fire damaged the interior, and in its wake the theater fell into disuse. The building became property of the city due to tax default. Later in the century it was renovated several times, twice from designs by Herbert Bayer, to bring it back into full use. For a while the Pitkin County Library was located in the building as well.\nToday it houses retail space and a restaurant in addition to the auditorium space, and is one of Aspen's most prominent landmarks. The city funds its operations through a real estate transfer tax that has built up a large surplus over the years. The Comedy Festival, then known as the HBO/US Comedy Arts Festival, was held in the building annually from 1985\u20132007. Among the performers who have appeared at the Wheeler are Lily Tomlin, Ren\u00e9e Fleming, Phish, John Denver and Bill Maher. Kate Hudson made her debut there as an elementary school student.[4] Michael Hutchence's last official live recording with INXS was also recorded at the Wheeler, within a year of his death.\n",

He would typically approach his victims in public places, either feigning a physical impairment such as an injury, or impersonating an authority figure, before bludgeoning them into unconsciousness and taking them to secondary locations to be raped and strangled. Bundy often revisited his victims, grooming and performing sexual acts with the corpses until decomposition and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. At least twelve of his victims were decapitated and their severed heads kept as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, he broke into homes at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.\n",

Ten students were killed in the school library, where Harris and Klebold subsequently committed suicide. Twenty-one additional people were injured by gunshots, and gunfire was also exchanged with the police. Another three people were injured trying to escape. At the time, it was the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history, until the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018.[b] The shooting has inspired dozens of copycat killings, dubbed the Columbine effect, including many deadlier shootings across the world.[c] The word \"Columbine\" has become a byword for school shootings.\nHarris and Klebold had intended for the attack to primarily be a bombing and secondarily a shooting, but the failed detonation of the several homemade bombs they planted in the school caused the pair to launch a shooting attack. Two bombs were set up as diversions at another location away from the school, one of which partially detonated. The motive remains inconclusive; however, they had planned the attack for at least a year and hoped to have a large number of victims. The police were slow to enter the school and were heavily criticized for not intervening during the shooting. The incident resulted in the introduction of the IARD tactic, which is used in active shooter situations. Columbine also resulted in an increased emphasis on school security with zero tolerance policies. Debates and moral panic were sparked over American gun culture and gun control laws, high school cliques, subcultures (e.g. goths), outcasts, and school bullying, as well as teenage use of pharmaceutical antidepressants, the internet, and violence in video games and movies.\n",

Twelve people were killed and 70 others were injured, 58 of them from gunfire. It was the deadliest shooting in Colorado since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. At the time, the event had the largest number of victims (82) in one shooting in modern U.S. history.[4] This number was later surpassed by the 107 victims of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.\nHolmes was arrested minutes later in his car outside the cinema. Earlier, he had rigged his apartment with homemade explosives and incendiary devices. These were defused by the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office Bomb Squad a day after the shooting.\n",

A long handwritten ransom note was found in the home. Her father, John, found the girl's body in the basement of their house about seven hours after she had been reported missing. She had sustained a broken skull from a blow to the head and had been strangled; a garrote was found tied around her neck. The autopsy report stated that JonBen\u00e9t's official cause of death was \"asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma\".[2][1] Her death was ruled a homicide.[3] The case generated worldwide public and media interest, in part because her mother Patsy Ramsey, a former beauty queen, had entered JonBen\u00e9t into a series of child beauty pageants. The crime is still considered a cold case and remains an open investigation with the Boulder Police Department.\nThe Boulder police initially suspected that the ransom note had been written by Patsy, and that the note and appearance of JonBen\u00e9t's body had been staged by her parents in order to cover up the murder. In 1998, the police and district attorney (DA) both said that JonBen\u00e9t's brother Burke, who was nine years old at the time of her death, was not a suspect.[4][5] JonBen\u00e9t's parents gave several televised interviews, but resisted police questioning except on their own terms. In October 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 grand jury had recommended filing charges against the Ramseys for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation. John and Patsy were also accused of hindering the prosecution of an unidentified person who had \"committed\u00a0... the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death\".[6] However, the DA determined that there was insufficient evidence to pursue a successful indictment.[6]\n",

A search of the backpack later recovered duct tape, handcuffs, knives, a stun gun, rope, scissors, massage oil, sex toys, and numerous rounds of ammunition, but no explosives.[1]\nA sixteen-year-old student named Katrina Keller reportedly saw Morrison entering the school before the time specified by police. She stated that she had been walking past a vacant classroom and saw a man inside wearing a hooded sweatshirt, apparently angry. Keller did not report the incident to the school office.[8] Other students reported that they witnessed Morrison sitting in a yellow Jeep in the school parking lot at around 10:45\u00a0a.m., almost an hour before he entered the school. Morrison was believed to have been living in the car, camping out near Bailey.[9] Videos taken from security cameras outside show that Morrison was in his Jeep for at least 20 minutes, mingling with students as classes changed, 35 minutes before the siege began. Earlier, Morrison had spoken to a male high school student that day and \"asked about the identity of a list of female students.\"[10]\n",

The school was named after its major benefactor, Nathan Matthews, Esq. of Boston.  Its building, designed by architect Thayer from Boston, was created to complement is sister schools Jarvis Hall and the Colorado School of Mines on campus.  It was a beautiful combination Gothic and Second Empire styled brick edifice with a central bell tower entrance and ornamental brickwork.  Inside, Matthews Hall featured on the first floor a chapel, professors' rooms and lavatory; the second floor housed a 1,500 volume theological library, recitation rooms and students' rooms; and the third floor housed students' dormitories.  The building starting in 1873 also housed the natural history wing of the Jarvis Hall Museum, organized by prominent Matthews Hall graduate Arthur Lakes.

He and his brother Charley, both members of the James\u2013Younger Gang under James\u2019s leadership, went on to perform paid re-enactments of the killing at publicity events. Ford would spend his later years operating multiple saloons and dance halls in the West.\nTen years after James's death, Ford was himself the victim of a fatal shot to the neck by Edward Capehart O'Kelley in Creede, Colorado, dying at only 30 years old. While initially buried in Creede, his remains were later exhumed and reinterred in his hometown of Richmond, Missouri.\nRobert Ford was born in 1862 in Ray County, Missouri, to James Thomas and Mary Bruin Ford as the youngest of seven siblings. As a young man, Ford came to admire Jesse James for his Civil War record and criminal exploits, eventually getting to meet him in 1880 at the age of 18.\n",

His partial remains were found by two businessmen on a hiking trip on May 6, 2003.[1] Atadero's disappearance and killing remain a cold case and anomaly noted for the fact that the boy's cause of death has never been officially classified. While often reported as a mountain lion attack, experts on felids have argued that the discovered remains do not meet the typical patterns of a mountain lion attack. Other experts believed that Atadero had been the victim of an abduction and murder. Owing in part to the sensationalism surrounding the Colorado case of child glitz pageant contestant JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, the media was heavily involved during the search of Atadero.[2][3]\nJaryd Atadero was the three-year-old son of Allyn Atadero and Stacie Mckissick, and had an older sister, then six-year-old Josallyn Atadero. Allyn Atadero was a divorcee raising both children, and he had recently joined the Christian Singles Network group, a local religious club. The club was known to have aided Allyn in daily life as a single father, and the Atadero Family became heavily intertwined with group activities among the club. Allyn himself, a physical education teacher at a local junior high school, found comfort in the religious devotion.[4][5]\nIn October of 1999, Allyn was staying with his two children in the Poudre River Resort, a commercial hotel owned by Allyn and his twin brother, Arlyn Atadero. Jaryd and Josallyn were anxious to go on an excursion to the nearby state fish hatchery with members of the Christian Singles Network group, something that Allyn had initially been reluctant about, but when the group said they would only be going to the hatchery, he consented, trusting the group to keep their word. At some point during the hatchery trip, the 11 members of the group plus Josallyn and Jaryd decided to take an early afternoon hike up the Big South Trail, 15 miles west of the resort. It is unclear why this decision was made, although Allyn noted that the beautiful weather may have been a factor, stating that it was \"one of those gorgeous fall bluebird days in the mountains of Colorado.\" Reports vary widely on the exact events that occurred on the trail leading up to Jaryd's disappearance. It is generally declared that the group split into faster and slower-paced groups on the trail, and that Jaryd ran ahead of the group he was with. The boy reportedly stopped to chat with two fishermen, who told investigators that they didn\u2019t think much about Jaryd being alone, since they had seen the Christian Singles Network group about 50 to 80 feet down the trail, unaware that Jaryd was not related to any of them. The last the fishermen saw of Jaryd, he was walking rapidly up the trail near adjacent campsites.[6][7]\n",

A long handwritten ransom note was found in the home. Her father, John, found the girl's body in the basement of their house about seven hours after she had been reported missing. She had sustained a broken skull from a blow to the head and had been strangled; a garrote was found tied around her neck. The autopsy report stated that JonBen\u00e9t's official cause of death was \"asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma\".[2][1] Her death was ruled a homicide.[3] The case generated worldwide public and media interest, in part because her mother Patsy Ramsey, a former beauty queen, had entered JonBen\u00e9t into a series of child beauty pageants. The crime is still considered a cold case and remains an open investigation with the Boulder Police Department.\nThe Boulder police initially suspected that the ransom note had been written by Patsy, and that the note and appearance of JonBen\u00e9t's body had been staged by her parents in order to cover up the murder. In 1998, the police and district attorney (DA) both said that JonBen\u00e9t's brother Burke, who was nine years old at the time of her death, was not a suspect.[4][5] JonBen\u00e9t's parents gave several televised interviews, but resisted police questioning except on their own terms. In October 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 grand jury had recommended filing charges against the Ramseys for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation. John and Patsy were also accused of hindering the prosecution of an unidentified person who had \"committed\u00a0... the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death\".[6] However, the DA determined that there was insufficient evidence to pursue a successful indictment.[6]\n",

As of 2012, there are over 500 chapters.[4] Although these groups originally concentrated more on education issues, this led to participation in political campaigns and protests against widespread issues such as police brutality and the U.S. war in Southeast Asia.[5]  Outside of Colorado, the Brown Berets, a Chicano youth group which began in California, took on a more militant and nationalistic ideology.[6] At the University of Colorado Boulder today, UMAS and MEChA have combined into a single coalition simply referred to as \"UMAS y MEXA\".[7]\nThe University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database has information on other Boulder, Colorado bombings in 1974 suspected to involve the same \"Chicano activists,\" and that \"The explosions came during a time of racial tensions in Colorado, especially in Denver and Boulder, where at least 10 bombings had occurred within the last year, primarily directed at public buildings such as schools, police stations, and courthouses.\"[8] 2 months prior to the deaths of \"Los Seis\", in March 1974 a Boulder police station was bombed. There were no casualties, though $8,000 worth of damage was caused.[8] Minutes later on the same day, the courthouse was bombed.[9]\n",

His former friend, Lucas Scott, and Lucas's brother, Nathan Scott, put themselves at risk to protect their classmates and loved ones.\nIn the DVD commentary and the making-of featurette, the creators addressed their initial \"should we?\" or \"shouldn't we?\" reactions to making the episode. Because of the sensitive nature of the topic, they did not want to glorify or make light of school shootings. They wanted to make a statement about how these kinds of incidents affect more than just those directly involved.[3] The music was carefully designed, and a theme called \"Saving Peyton,\" composed by John Nordstrom, was introduced for parts of the script where character Lucas Scott strives to save a dying Peyton Sawyer.[4]\n",

The idea and the award were founded by Charles Kerr, a long-time coach.[3]\nThere is also a move in Ultimate named after Callahan called a Callahan.  A Callahan is when a defensive player intercepts the disc in the opponent's end zone for a point.  It is a rare occurrence, because it requires a defender to intercept, rather than simply block, a pass in the offense's own end zone. Under normal circumstances, the offense does not start a possession within their own end zone, so opportunities for a Callahan are limited to situations where the offense has been forced into their own end zone (either by a good pull or defensive pressure) or backward passes near the end zone.  The move is so called because it was first legalized as a goal (rather than needing to be put into play from the goal line) in the Callahan version of the rules, which differed from the Ultimate Player Association's current rules at the time.  The rules were subsequently changed in both the UPA (now USA Ultimate) and the World Flying Disc Federation to make a Callahan a legal goal under all rule sets used for Ultimate. \nHenry Callahan was also a disc golf player and his family donated money to install a memorial disc golf course at Bevier Park in Waukegan, Illinois.[citation needed] Completed in 1992 and expanded in 2008, this course is located in Henry Callahan Memorial Park.[4]\n",

As his father had before him, Gorman joined the US Air Force, working as an air traffic controller. He worked in Vietnam, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. He was stationed near Miyakojima in Japan at a long-range radar facility during the Vietnam War. His first wife introduced him to marijuana in Loveland, Colorado in 1969.[2] Gorman was often quoted as saying \"It has been a friend of mine ever since.\" He went on to a career with the FAA as an air traffic controller. On August 5, 1981, while stationed in Hawaii, he was fired by Ronald Reagan along with 11,358 other PATCO (Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization) members who were on strike.  \nAfter that, he worked in Papua New Guinea, recruiting students for \"western-style\" schooling. Around 1984, he became very friendly with the natives and gave them a public voice with radio broadcasts and newspaper articles about natives rights. Although he was arrested and charged with many crimes, he was only ever convicted on possession of pornography (a Playboy magazine). He was given a plane ticket to Manila, some spending money, and was escorted to the airport. Gorman's good friend, Pious Wingti, took power in 1985. Wingti's election victory was significantly due to the public outrage over Gorman's deportation. Later, he assisted the Philippine rebels in their quest to overthrow Ferdinand Marcos. He was forcibly deported in 1985. The Filipino people succeeded in deposing Marcos the following year. \n",

In addition, they found incentive in the warfare that had been waged specifically against their clans by the military in 1867 and by memories of such atrocities as the Sand Creek massacre. Finally, the westward movement of the transcontinental railroad had stretched all the way across Kansas, bringing with it many permanent white settlements.\n",

He hoped to campaign for Korea's freedom at the 1908 Democratic National Convention, but was killed under mysterious circumstances in a suspected assassination in 1907 and buried in an unmarked grave at Denver's Riverside Cemetery, where he lay forgotten for almost a century.[2][3]\nIn 2003, South Korean scholars doing research on immigration to the United States found records about Park in Korea and began to look through Denver cemetery records in an attempt to find him. After his burial site was identified, the local Korean American association held a ceremony in October 2007, during which they erected a new $3,000 granite headstone with a bilingual epitaph describing Park's life and accomplishments; 50 people attended the ceremony, including South Korean consul general Koo Bon-woo.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Copper Canyon Apartment Homes Shooting was a shooting on December 31, 2017, in Highlands Ranch, Colorado. One police deputy, Zackari Parrish, was fatally shot, and four others were wounded. Two civilians were also shot by the suspect, who was later killed in an exchange of gun fire with a SWAT tactical team. The suspect reportedly used a rifle and a shotgun. Law enforcement had responded first to a noise complaint, then to a domestic-disturbance call to the apartment. During the second visit, the suspect barricaded himself in his bedroom and shot the deputies in an \"ambush\" style when they entered. The suspect was later shot dead by a police tactical team that subsequently re-entered the apartment.[2] It was later determined that the suspect, former attorney[3] Matthew Riehl, was a veteran with a history of psychotic episodes and he had recently stopped taking his medication.[4][5][6]\nMatthew Riehl (September 9, 1980\u00a0\u2013 December 31, 2017) attended CU Denver, graduating magna cum laude in 2004, according to his mother. He had joined as an army reserve in 2003[7] before serving in the Iraq War as a combat medic whilst attending law school at the University of Wyoming, which he graduated from after returning from Iraq. He then went to work for a law firm in Rawlins, Wyoming for three years before leaving to set up his own practice. He joined the United States National Guard in 2006 reaching the rank of Specialist and serving from 2009 to 2010, again as a medic, in Kuwait and Iraq in the 300th Field Artillery Regiment[7] where he didn't face combat. Riehl was involved in escorting convoys of troops 130 miles (210\u00a0km) through the desert at night.[8]\n",

Gallegos gave police permission to enter her apartment in order for them to obtain a photograph of her daughter to aid them in their search. Once inside the apartment police noticed a \"paper towel on the floor of the living room that had blood or some other type of bodily fluid on it\".[3]\nLater that day, Gallegos agreed to answer questions from the police. She told them she had received a telephone call at work,[4]  the same day as she made the 911 call.[2] The call was from her boyfriend who she named as Angel Montoya. He told her to come home but did not explain why. Gallegos left work and walked home. When she entered her apartment she discovered her daughter, Neveah, who was not breathing.[4] She claimed she had tried to \"put air into Neveah\" but was unable to revive her.[3][4] She informed the police that she and Montoya decided not to call an ambulance but instead opted to put Neveah's corpse into a \"white trash bag\", which they then put inside a \"black trash bag\", and placed the bagged body into a duffel bag.[2][4] She claimed that she and Montoya left the building and he, with the duffel bag, went a different way.

The victims were beaten and strangled, and their bodies dumped in the countryside along Interstate 70. Some of the bodies were posed in humiliating positions.[1] According to investigators, the offender is responsible for the murder of 18-year-old Karolyn Walker, who disappeared on July 4, 1987, after meeting with her fianc\u00e9. After being kidnapped she was raped and strangled. During the course of the investigation, police found no incriminating evidence or witnesses, despite the fact that Walker likely resisted fiercely, as she was a good swimmer, did gymnastics and had considerable physical strength.[2]\nOther victims include 17-year-old prostitute Kimberly Jean Grabin, who was found raped and strangled on August 18, 1979, near the I-70;[3] 15-year-old Stephanie Ann Bauman, who went missing in October 1980 after hitchhiking to her home.

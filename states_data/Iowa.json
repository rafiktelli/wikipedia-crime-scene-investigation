        "paragraph": "All Saints Catholic Church is a parish church building in the Diocese of Des Moines. The building is located in Stuart, Iowa, United States.   The parish used the building as its church until a devastating fire severely damaged the structure.  The church was rebuilt and it now  serves as a cultural center called the Historic All Saints/Saints Center for Culture and the Arts.   It is  listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a rare example of Neo-Byzantine architecture in the state of Iowa.[2]\nThe Catholic Church in Stuart traces its beginnings to August 1871 when a Father Moniahan from Des Moines came to town for the first time to celebrate Mass.  He would come at irregular intervals and Mass was celebrated in school rooms, Shield's Hall, and in private homes.  At this time the whole state of Iowa was part of the Diocese of Dubuque.\nThe first church was built in 1874 under the direction of the Rev. Edward Gaul.  It was dedicated by the Very Rev. J.F. Brazil from St. Ambrose in Des Moines on the Feast of All Saints, November 1, 1877.  The Rev. James Foley was pastor at the time and he built two additions onto the church as well as the rectory during his 24 years at All Saints.  During that time he was also responsible for parishes in Casey, Adair, Guthrie Center and Greenfield.[3]  The parish became a part of the Diocese of Davenport when it was established in 1881.\n"

Sometime that night he went home to his apartment in the Russell-Lamson building. With him was 23-year-old Joseph Lawrence. Gage was originally from Oelwein, Iowa.[5] He'd lived in Chicago and Milwaukee before moving to Waterloo years earlier. He settled downtown, and worked waiting tables in the Italian restaurant of his apartment building. He enrolled at the College of Hair Design in Waterloo, Iowa, in January 2003, and his friends said he dreamed of working in a big city salon.[6]\nLawrence was born in Seaford, Delaware. He was removed from his birth parents after severe abuse and spent several years in foster care before being adopted at age 5. He moved with his adoptive parents to Maryland, New Jersey, and then to Ohio. During his time in Ohio, he decided he no longer wanted to be adopted and moved back into foster care at age 16. From there, he moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and then on to New Mexico. In early 2003, Lawrence moved from Farmington, New Mexico, where he had been an oil worker to Cedar Falls, Iowa, to be with his girlfriend\u2014Elizabeth Hostetler\u2014who was six months pregnant with their child. The couple\u2014who had been together for a year\u2014decided to move to Cedar Falls, because Hostetler had many \"lifelong friends\" in the area who could help with the baby.[7] Hostetler said she introduced Gage and Lawrence about a week before Gage's murder.

It came to light in 2017, after Eddie Raymond Tipton, the former information security director of the Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL), confessed to rigging a random number generator that he and two others used in multiple cases of fraud against state lotteries. Tipton was first convicted in October 2015 of rigging a $14.3 million drawing of MUSL's lottery game Hot Lotto. Eddie Tipton ultimately confessed to rigging lottery drawings in Iowa, Colorado, Wisconsin, Kansas and Oklahoma. Also involved in the scheme were his brother and former Texas justice of the peace Tommy Tipton and Texas businessman Robert Rhodes.[1][2] Eddie Tipton was sentenced to 25 years in prison.[1][2]\nA $14.3 million prize for the Hot Lotto draw on December 29, 2010, had been left unclaimed for nearly a year, when attempts were made to claim the prize on behalf of an anonymous, off-shore trust company in Belize. The claim was rejected by the Iowa Lottery because it was made anonymously.[3][4][5][6] A subsequent investigation into the trust and the discovery of surveillance footage from a convenience store that depicted the ticket being purchased, led to the arrest of Eddie Tipton on two counts of fraud for attempting to illegally participate in a lottery game as an employee of the MUSL, and then trying to claim a prize through fraudulent means.[7]\nWhen his trial began on April 13, 2015, evidence was introduced by the prosecutors to support allegations that Tipton had rigged the draw in question by using his privileged access to an MUSL facility to install a rootkit on the computer containing Hot Lotto's random number generator, and then attempting to claim a winning ticket with the rigged numbers anonymously.[8][9] On July 20, 2015, Tipton was found guilty on both counts;[8] he was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, pending an appeal.[5]\n"

The event occurred at Maharishi University of Management (later renamed to Maharishi International University), Fairfield, Iowa, United States, and attracted attention partly due to the university's practice of \"yogic flying,\" which proponents say reduces violence in the surrounding area.[1] Sem was found not guilty due to insanity. A lawsuit against the university that had charged negligence was settled out of court.\nOn March 1, 2004, Shuvender Sem, who had been enrolled at the university for less than two months,[2] stabbed another student in the face with a pen during a class called Teaching for Enlightenment.[1] Told by university staff that he did not require medical attention, the injured student drove himself to the hospital where he received seven stitches.[3] University officials consulted a psychologist and decided that Sem would have to leave the university, but didn't report the incident to police. Sem didn't appear dangerous or agitated and was taken by Joel Wysong, the school's dean of men, to his on-campus apartment until he could take a flight home the next morning.[2] Left unattended, Sem took a paring knife from Wysong's kitchen and went to the university's dining hall.[4] Wysong followed Sem to the dining hall and watched while Sem interacted with other students, but did not take him back into custody. After about ten minutes and without provocation, Sem stabbed another student, freshman Levi Butler, four times in the chest, killing him.[1][5]\nSem, who was \"a diagnosed schizophrenic\", reportedly \"had been off his medication for months\" at the time of the murder.[6] After initially being declared incompetent, Sem was subsequently deemed competent to stand trial.[7][8] The judge ruled Sem not guilty by reason of insanity at the urging of both the defense attorneys and prosecutors.[9] In an April 22, 2010, news article in the Des Moines Register, Michael Taylor, the Des Moines-area psychiatrist who testified on Sem's behalf at his trial, says that the insanity defense was appropriate for this case.[10]\n"

As a graduate student, Lu was primarily a loner who was perceived by at least one other graduate student to have a psychological problem if challenged and was reported to have had abusive tantrums.[3][4] Lu was infuriated because his dissertation, titled Study of the \"Critical Ionization Velocity\" Effect by Particle-in-Cell Simulation, did not receive the prestigious D.\u00a0C. Spriestersbach Dissertation Prize, which included a monetary award of $2,500. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 led many Chinese students to become eager to stay in the United States, and Lu believed that winning the prize would have made it easier for him to get a job and not have to return to China. Normally, Lu would have gotten a postdoctoral researcher position, but there was not enough money to support him.[5]\nIn the months prior to the shooting, Lu was still living in Iowa City and wrote five letters explaining the reasons for his planned actions. According to university officials, four of the five letters were written in English and one was written in Chinese, intended to be mailed to news organizations. The letters have never been released to the public.\n"

Sometime that night he went home to his apartment in the Russell-Lamson building. With him was 23-year-old Joseph Lawrence. Gage was originally from Oelwein, Iowa.[5] He'd lived in Chicago and Milwaukee before moving to Waterloo years earlier. He settled downtown, and worked waiting tables in the Italian restaurant of his apartment building. He enrolled at the College of Hair Design in Waterloo, Iowa, in January 2003, and his friends said he dreamed of working in a big city salon.[6]\nLawrence was born in Seaford, Delaware. He was removed from his birth parents after severe abuse and spent several years in foster care before being adopted at age 5. He moved with his adoptive parents to Maryland, New Jersey, and then to Ohio. During his time in Ohio, he decided he no longer wanted to be adopted and moved back into foster care at age 16. From there, he moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and then on to New Mexico. In early 2003, Lawrence moved from Farmington, New Mexico, where he had been an oil worker to Cedar Falls, Iowa, to be with his girlfriend\u2014Elizabeth Hostetler\u2014who was six months pregnant with their child. The couple\u2014who had been together for a year\u2014decided to move to Cedar Falls, because Hostetler had many \"lifelong friends\" in the area who could help with the baby.[7] Hostetler said she introduced Gage and Lawrence about a week before Gage's murder. Hostetler had met Gage through an acquaintance and had known him for about two years.[8]\n"

He was convicted of first-degree murder and first-degree kidnapping on January 31, 2006.[1] On February 24, he was sentenced to two consecutive mandatory sentences of life in prison without parole.[2]\nProsecutors alleged that Bentley took Gage from her home to a run-down trailer in rural Johnson County, Iowa, where he raped and killed her. An AMBER Alert was issued shortly after it was noticed that she was missing. The AMBER Alert program had errors that night. A proper description with name and picture did not appear until hours after she had vanished. Bentley was arrested a day later. Investigators found her body inside a bathroom cabinet inside the trailer.\nBentley's trial was moved to Scott County on the defense's change of venue motion because of extensive pre-trial publicity; local media dubbed the case \"Justice for Jetseta.\" During his trial, prosecutors linked DNA evidence found on Gage's body to Bentley, while the defense (which did not call any witnesses) claimed there were no eyewitnesses to the crime or direct evidence.[3][4] It took just over two hours for the jury to arrive at its guilty verdict.\n"

Harrington played the majority of his games in the majors at catcher; however, he did play first base and third base on occasion. In 189 major league games between the Cincinnati Reds and the Louisville Colonels, Harrington batted .227 with 60 runs, 151 hits, 19 doubles, six triples, three home runs, 73 runs batted in (RBIs), and eight stolen bases.\nHarrington was born in Hamden, Ohio on August 12, 1868. His father was the manager of the Keokuk, Iowa baseball club in 1885.[1] At the age of 16, Jerry Harrington began to play semi-professional baseball with the Bonaparte, Iowa team.[1] Two years later, Harrington began to play with the Creston, Iowa ball club of the Iowa League.[1]\nIn 1888, Harrington began his professional career in the Central Interstate League. That season, he played for the Danville Browns, the Davenport club, and the Decatur club. Harrington continued to play in the Central Interstate League in 1889 with the Davenport Hawkeyes/Monmouth Browns. Harrington made his major league debut on April 30, 1890 with the Cincinnati Reds. In his first season, he batted .246 with 25 runs, 58 hits, seven doubles, one triple, one home run, 23 RBIs, and four stolen bases in 65 games. Lee Allen, author of The Cincinnati Reds, wrote that Harrington and fellow player Billy Rhines were two top prospects when they joined the Reds, although nearly unknown today.[2] It was also said that Harrington could throw out a baserunner from his knees.[2] In 1891, Harrington's second season with the Reds, he batted .228 with 25 runs, 76 hits, 10 doubles, five triples, two home runs, 41 RBIs, and four stolen bases in 92 games. In David L. Porter's Biographical Dictionary of American Sports: Q\u2013Z, it was noted that Rhines, Harrington and fellow Reds teammate Pete Browning received fines and suspensions because of misbehavior outside of baseball.[3] Harrington played his final season with the Reds in 1892. In 22 games, Harrington batted .213 with six runs, 13 hits, one double, and three RBIs. In 1893, Harrington joined the Louisville Colonels, which would prove to be his final season in professional baseball. With the Colonels, Harrington batted .111 with four runs, four hits, one double, and three RBIs in 10 games.\n"

However, the case gradually grew cold as the investigation stretched on.\nIn 2006, a cold case investigator discovered unidentified blood, presumably belonging to the killer, while he was reviewing case files. A DNA profile was developed from that evidence and entered into the national Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), but no matches were found. In 2017, a company specializing in DNA phenotyping was hired to produce a new approximation of the killer's appearance based solely off the DNA sample. In 2018, the company entered the DNA data from the case into the public genealogy website GEDmatch, where it found a familial DNA match.\n"

We'll eat our wheat and ham and eggs, And let them eat their gold\".[2]\nFarmers went to extreme measures to ensure that their wants were carried through. One person was killed when the farmers began to blockade roads, and other farmers rallied to destroy their crops, reducing supply, and raising prices.  The highways into Sioux City and Council Bluffs, Iowa, were blocked by pickets who dumped farm produce on the side of the road.[3] At Le Mars, Iowa some farmers dragged a judge out of his courtroom, placed a noose around his neck, and threatened to hang him unless he stopped approving farm foreclosures.

After distrustful farmers tried and failed to repeal the testing program, they gathered in numbers to block tests from taking place. The farmers believed that the test might infect cows with tuberculosis or make pregnant cows have spontaneous abortions. They also believed that the testing was unconstitutional. The owner of Muscatine radio station KTNT, Norman G. Baker, spread misinformation which resulted in more farmers protesting testing, sometimes causing violence. The Iowa Cow War came to a conclusion when 31 Iowa National Guard units were deployed to stop the protesting. Two farmers were arrested for their actions during the conflict.\nBovine tuberculosis was an issue for Iowans prior to the eradication of the disease starting in 1929. In 1894, an Iowa veterinarian said that tuberculosis was the main issue that his office faced. People often did not understand the danger of tuberculosis in cows due to the long period of incubation and its effects. Many respected medical professionals thought that cows were unable to transmit the disease to people, including Robert Koch, who completed early research on tuberculosis.[1] The State of Iowa required the tests to reduce the frequency with which dairy cattle with tuberculosis would contaminate the milk supply and cause milk-drinking people to contract the disease.[2] The program was financed by a property tax levy of up to 3 mills.[2] In 1929, the Iowa State Legislature passed a law stating that all cows, whether used for dairy or meat, had to be tested for bovine tuberculosis. Iowa farmers, who did not trust the tests, were opposed to the law. The farmers believed that the test might infect cows with tuberculosis or make pregnant cows have spontaneous abortions. They also thought that the test was against the United States Constitution, but this was dismissed by the Iowa Supreme Court in 1930.[3]\n"

        "paragraph": "Edward James Gantner Jr. (February 4, 1959 \u2013 December 31, 1990) was an American professional wrestler and American football player.[1]\nEdward James Ganter Jr.[2] was born in Orlando, Florida, the youngest of four children. Ed was the only son with three older sisters. By the time he was three years old, his father would throw him a football hard enough to knock him down, only to get back up and throw it back. His mother and sisters never recall Gantner having a knack for football. He was considered a \"puny little runt,\" all the way through junior high school.\nGantner's life began to change around age twelve when his parents separated. His father moved out of the house, while his mother went back to school. His mother and sisters worked to keep the family afloat, and during this period he found solace in weight lifting, pumping iron for hours alone in his room, also finding solace in surfing.\nGantner's major football career started at Edgewater High School. Around his junior year, he began using steroids. Between his junior and senior years in high school, he gained 45\u00a0lbs. His newly found physique gained him confidence to point, where he talked incessantly about the weight he gained, how much he could lift, and the size of his biceps and neck.\nAfter graduating from high school, he received a college scholarship to play football for the University of Tennessee, but after less than a year, he became depressed and homesick.\nAfter returning home to Orlando, he took a hiatus, working as a bartender and a bouncer. In 1980, he returned to playing college football, this time for Central Florida, as a starter. He was also had the honor of being the first man from the college to go professional. He played pro football in the United States Football League, where he played for the Tampa Bay Bandits for one year, and for the Jacksonville Bulls for two years.[3]\nGantner made his debut for Championship Wrestling from Florida in 1985 as a heel,[1] joining the House of Humperdink, led by Sir Oliver Humperdink.[4] Within the group, he formed a tag team with Kareem Muhammed called the Shock Troops.[4] They made their debut on TV jumping The Fabulous Ones, starting a program with them. They also unsuccessfully challenged The Road Warriors at Battle Of The Belts 3 on September 3, 1986, which was Gantner's only pay-per-view appearance.[5] He would also have a feud with Lex Luger that would go on for a good part of 1986.\nIn February 1987, Gantner was awarded the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship, after his manager Sir Oliver Humperdink defeated Bad News Allen for the title.[6] After losing the title to Mike Rotunda a month later,[6] Gantner turned on Humperdink, turning him face. Gantner feuded with Humperdink's group with Barry Windham, Blackjack Mulligan, Bugsy McGraw and even Dusty Rhodes as his partner at different times.[1] However, by July 1987, even with him in most of the major angles for Championship Wrestling from Florida, he abruptly retired from pro wrestling due to health issues.[1]\nIn 1988, Gantner's health began to decline after years of steroid use.[1] His kidneys were the first to start failing, causing him to undergo kidney dialysis, and he had to be hooked up several hours a week to a machine to survive.\n",

        "paragraph": "In 2009, Bernice Novack and her son, Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel heir Ben Novack Jr., were murdered three months apart. Narcy Novack (n\u00e9e Narcisa V\u00e9liz Pacheco; born 1956), Ben's estranged wife, was convicted of orchestrating the murders and after a highly publicized trial, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[1]\nOn April 5, 2009, Ben's 87-year-old mother, Bernice (December 2, 1921 \u2013 April 4, 2009), was found dead in her Fort Lauderdale, Florida garage. Her husband Ben Novack Sr., who built the hotel and owned it until 1977, had died in 1985.[2] Her death was initially ruled to be the result of an accidental fall while trying to get out of her car in her garage,[3] but after her son's murder three months later, a subsequent police investigation revealed that her death was a homicide.[4]\nOn the morning of July 12, 2009, her son, who was 53, was found bludgeoned and suffocated to death in the penthouse suite at the Hilton Hotel in Rye Brook, New York. He was bound with duct tape and his eyes were gouged out.[5] At the time of his death, he was having an affair with porn actress Rebecca Bliss. He was also the heir to a multimillion-dollar estate.[6]\nNarcy Novack, from Fort Lauderdale,[7] was arrested for the murders of her husband and mother-in-law in July 2010, three days shy of a year after her husband's death. Her brother, Crist\u00f3bal V\u00e9liz, was also accused of enlisting Alejandro Guti\u00e9rrez-Garc\u00eda, Joel Gonz\u00e1lez, and Denis Ram\u00edrez to participate in both murders.[8]\nNarcy Novack and Crist\u00f3bal V\u00e9liz were tried together in a federal courtroom in White Plains, New York in 2012. The duo's defense was to blame Narcy's only daughter from a previous marriage, May Abad, for having orchestrated the killings, stating that she was motivated to collect on Ben Novack Jr.'s estate, including a large collection of Batman memorabilia.[9] Prosecutors alleged that Narcy was afraid that her husband would leave her for his mistress, and that a prenuptial agreement would only leave her $65,000 instead of the bulk of her late husband's estate.[10] They claimed she was motivated by \"hatred, greed, and vengeance.\"[9]\nAt the conclusion of the trial, Narcy and Veliz were each convicted of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, domestic violence, stalking, money laundering, and witness tampering. Narcy waived her right to appear in court when the guilty verdict was read. She also did not appear in court when she was sentenced to life in prison without parole.[9] Novack is currently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution Tallahassee in Tallahassee, Florida.[11] V\u00e9liz was also sentenced to life in prison without parole and he is currently incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary, Big Sandy in Inez, Kentucky.[11] Guti\u00e9rrez-Garc\u00eda, Gonz\u00e1lez, and Ram\u00edrez all pleaded guilty to lesser charges.\nIn accordance with the slayer rule, Narcy Novack is ineligible to inherit her husband's estate. Ben Novack Jr.'s estate, valued at $4.2 million, is expected to go to Novack's daughter, May Abad, and Abad's two sons.[6]\nThe Novack murders have been televised on several programs including Deadly Rich, My Dirty Little Secret (ID),[12] 48 Hours,[13] Dateline NBC,[10] Snapped,[14] True Crime with Aphrodite Jones[15][16] and Dying to Belong.[17][18]\nThe story was also the basis for the 2015 made-for-television Lifetime movie Beautiful & Twisted, which starred Rob Lowe as Ben Novack Jr., Paz Vega as Narcy, and Candice Bergen as Bernice Novack.[19][20]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Andrew Coffey lawsuit involved the death of a young man who was killed in November 2017 during a fraternity event, triggering an anti-hazing movement in Florida. On November 3, 2017, Florida State University junior Andrew Coffey was killed by acute alcohol poisoning after participating in Big Brother Night, a fraternity event hosted by Pi Kappa Phi. Coffey was found unresponsive on a couch the morning after the event, and his death became part of a national wave of criticism of fraternity hazing practices. Members of the fraternity were eventually prosecuted for their role in Andrew Coffey's death, with three former fraternity leaders awaiting trial as of December 2018[needs update].\nAndrew Coffey, a junior who transferred to FSU to study civil engineering, was a prospective member of Pi Kappa Phi\u2014commonly referred to as a pledge. On November 2, the fraternity was hosting \"Big Brother Night\" at an off-campus house. Big Brother Night was intended to celebrate pledges becoming mentored by their sponsors, and it was typically a night of heavy drinking for the fraternity. At the time, the fraternity was under a liquor ban, but fraternity members told pledges that the liquor ban was lifted specifically for Big Brother Night.[1][2] The fraternity's Executive Council arranged for rideshare vehicles to take fraternity members and pledges from the fraternity house to an off-campus location. The arrangement was meant to circumvent university policies and national chapter policies regarding alcohol.[citation needed]\nAt some point during the party, Coffey was given a bottle of Wild Turkey bourbon and was coerced into drinking it all in a tradition known as \"the family bottle.\"[3][4][2] Court records said that while pledges were not physically forced into drinking, \"it is clear the environment created by the leaders and fraternity members led to an expectation of abusive drinking or the pledges would face ostracism by the group.\"[2] He drank enough that he passed out.[1][4]\nIn the morning, another pledge found Coffey was unresponsive. Before calling 911, he called and texted fraternity members, creating an 11-minute delay between Coffey\u2019s discovery and an eventual call for help. An autopsy revealed that Coffey had a blood alcohol level of 0.447, or over 5 times the legal limit.[5][1] At the time of his death, his BAC might have reached as high as 0.558, or about 7 times the legal limit.[2]\nDuring the 911 call, someone can be heard saying \"We had a party last night and my friend passed out on the couch on his side and his lips are purple. His body is extremely stiff and I can't wake him up, and, honestly, I don't feel a pulse.\" Fraternity members reportedly didn't know the address of the house or the nearest intersection. Most of the audio tape of the 911 call has the dispatcher leading the caller through chest compressions.[6]\nCNN reported that law enforcement was frustrated by the general lack of cooperation with the investigation among fraternity members. Of the 9 fraternity leaders, 7 refused to speak, and 19 pledges refused to speak to law enforcement as well. The grand jury presentment alleged that those who did speak to the police were reciting a pre-rehearsed script that offered mostly self-serving information.[1]\nRegardless, the grand jury found the evidence worthy of indictment. On January 17, 2018, nine fraternity members from Pi Kappa Phi were arrested and charged with hazing causing injury or death, which is a third-degree felony in Florida under the Chad Meredith Act.[6] 5 of the defendants pled guilty to 2 counts of misdemeanor hazing, and 4 of them spent 60 days in jail. One of the defendants, Connor Ravelo, was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 20 of which he had previously served.[4] Ravelo was the only one called to testify before the grand jury. According to court records, he was the one who bought the Wild Turkey bottle that Coffey was coerced into drinking. He was underage when he purchased it with a fake ID. Investigators said there were, in total, 21 underage drinkers at Big Brother Night who were encouraged to drink to excess.[2]\nThree of the men charged with felony hazing pled not guilty.[4] A judge initially dismissed the felony case against the three men after defense lawyers argued that the charges under Florida's hazing statute were \"too vague.\" State Prosecutor Jack Campbell has appealed the judge's ruling and the appeal is currently pending.[7] \"Andrew Coffey is dead and this qualifies as a felony,\" Campbell said.\nIn December 2018, the Florida Supreme Court issued a decision regarding the hazing death of Robert Champion, who was a student at Florida A&M University. Defense lawyers for one of the men charged with Champion's death argued that the hazing statute was too vague and unconstitutional. The Supreme Court rejected that argument and ruled in favor of the lower court's decision, affirming that the hazing statute is sufficiently clear and constitutional.[8] It has not yet been made clear how this will affect the case against the men charged with Andrew Coffey's death.\n",

        "paragraph": "Sami Osmakac (born December 28, 1986) is an Albanian American convicted by a jury on June 10, 2014, following a criminal trial in U.S. District Court, of plotting terrorist attacks in and near Tampa, Florida.[9][10]\nOsmakac, an Albanian and a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested January 7, 2012, for his plot. He intended to bomb nightclubs, detonate a car bomb, fire an assault rifle, wear an explosive belt in a crowded area, and take hostages.[9]\nOsmakac recorded an eight-minute video prior to his arrest describing the planned attack as retribution for wrongs committed against Muslims. The Federal Bureau of Investigation claimed Osmakac bought explosives and firearms from an undercover agent. He had been under investigation since September 2011, when a confidential source informed federal authorities that Osmakac walked into a business seeking al-Qaeda flags.[9]\nOsmakac appeared in videos posted to an extremist YouTube nom de guerre \"Abu Samia\", in which he condemned other religions and secular Muslims.[11] Osmakac was kicked out of two mosques in the Tampa Bay area and reported to the FBI by a Muslim acquaintance.[12] The FBI then set up a sting operation, supplying Osmakac, who could not even afford to fix the car he intended to drive, with money to purchase weapons and a video camera stolen from Best Buy to make his video.[13] They gave money to Abdul Dabus, who was both Osmakac's employer and the confidential source that reported him, and had him instruct Osmakac to give the money to the undercover agent as a \"down payment.\"[14]. The agent then instructed Sami in the use of the fake weapons, and helped him plant a fake car bomb and arrange transport to a hotel where he was supposed to detonate a suicide vest. His brother, Avni, later remarked, \"my brother was mentally ill. We were trying to get him help. The FBI got to him first.\"[14]\nDuring the trial, Osmakac's defense argued that the FBI took advantage of his radical Islamic beliefs, mental illness, and destitution to entrap him into trying to commit a crime. The court responded that, \"A reduction to a defendant's sentence is only warranted, however, if the sting operation involved 'extraordinary misconduct.' United States v. Ciszkowski, 492 F.3d 1264, 1271 (11th Cir. 2007). The party raising the defense ... bears the 'burden of establishing that the government's conduct is sufficiently reprehensible.'\"[15] On November 5, 2014, Osmakac was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Osmakac attempted to appeal his sentence but the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit confirmed his conviction and sentence in 2017.[16][13][17]\n",

        "paragraph": "Betty Jean Owens (born 1940) is an African American woman who was brutally raped by four white men in Tallahassee, Florida in 1959.[1] Her trial was significant in Florida, and the South as a whole, because the white men were given life sentences for their crimes.  Prior to Owens' case, sentences of this severity had not been imposed in the South on white men accused of raping black women.[2] For example, in the case of Recy Taylor, who was gang-raped by six white men in Alabama, the men were never found guilty of any charges and released from jail with minimal fines.[3]\nOn May 2, 1959, four white men, William Collinsworth, Ollie Stoutamire, Patrick Scarborough, and David Beagles, set out together to find a woman to sexually assault. They approached a car at Jake Gaither Park armed with shotguns and switchblades. Patrick Scarborough pressed his shotgun against the African American driver's nose and ordered the occupants out of the car.[4] Four African Americans stepped out of the car, two men and two women. All four people in the car were students at Florida A&M University (FAMU). Scarborough forced the two black men to kneel on the ground, and David Beagles held the two black women at knifepoint. Scarborough ordered the black men, Richard Brown and Thomas Butterfield, to leave and they slowly drove away.[5]\nThe two black women left at the hands of the four white men were Edna Richardson and Betty Jean Owens. Edna Richardson broke free of the men and ran into a nearby park, leaving Betty Jean Owens alone with her attackers. Beagles promised to release her only if she did what they wanted her to do.[6] They drove her to the edge of town and subsequently raped her seven times. Edna Richardson and the other two male students were able to make it back to their car and went to the local police station to report what had happened to them. The officer on duty that night was a nineteen-year-old intern, Joseph D. Cooke, Jr.  To the surprise of many people, he called for back up and searched for Owens. The officer spotted the assailant's car and a chase ensued. Eventually, the men pulled their car over and the muffled screams of Owens could be heard from the car. She was bound and gagged on the backseat floorboard.[7]\nThe four men were then arrested and taken to jail. The four men did not take their arrest seriously and joked with each other on the way to jail.  All four men confessed in writing to having abducted Owens at gunpoint and raping her.[8]\nAfter FAMU students learned of the attack on Owens, a small group planned an armed march to city hall. This armed march would symbolize their protection of black womanhood with guns as the whites protected white womanhood.[9] Other student leaders argued against an armed march and instead planned a \u201cUnity\u201d demonstration. Fifteen hundred students entered the Lee Auditorium to demand justice for Owens, and the student leaders announced that they would petition the governor for a \"speedy and impartial trial\". The following day, over a thousand students gathered with signs and prayers that were broadcast over news media. Many of these students connected the events to other issues in the struggle for black freedom, such as the desegregation issues in Little Rock, Arkansas. These students held up posters with scenes from Little Rock that read, \"My God How Much More of This Can We Take\". Even the BBC broadcast segments of the FAMU student demonstrations. As a result of prominent media coverage, student protests, and a threat to boycott classes, Judge W. May Walker called together a grand jury into special session on May 6, 1959.[10][11]\nMore than 200 black spectators entered the courtroom that day to watch the trial. A nurse accompanied Owens because she was still undergoing treatment for injuries as well as depression. All four men pled not guilty, to the shock of the spectators in the courtroom. The innocence pleas made a jury trial mandatory. This case was significant because, for the first time in Florida, a judge sent white defendants charged with raping a black woman to jail to await their trial. Previously, Florida had never executed a white man for raping a black woman, and many thought that this could be the trial to change that.[12]\nAttitudes about the trial varied among black leaders. Ella Baker, the director the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, felt that the evidence in the case was so strong that the jury could not fail to convict. Elijah Muhammad, leader of the Nation of Islam, said that the four rapists destroyed the \"virginity of our daughters\". Furthermore, he explained that \"Appeals for justice will avail us nothing... We know there is no justice under the American flag.\" The Pittsburgh Courier wrote that the trial would most likely end in acquittal, although the case was \"as open and shut as a case can be.\" Following the indictment of the four men, Martin Luther King Jr., expressed praise for the FAMU student protesters. King explained that they gave \"hope to all of us who struggle for human dignity and equal justice.\"[13]\nOn June 12, 1959, Betty Jean Owens testified on her own behalf in front of 400 witnesses. She retold the events of the attack to the jury in detail. She told the jury, \u201cI was so scared, but there was nothing I could do with four men, a knife, and a gun ... I couldn\u2019t do anything but what they said.\u201d The defence attorneys worked diligently to prove that Owens had consented to the attack and argued that if a rape did occur that she would have sustained more serious injuries. The doctors that treated Owens told the jury that her injuries resulted in a five-day hospital stay and that she was in a terrible condition. When the prosecution rested its case, the defence attorneys claimed that the state had failed to do anything but prove sexual intercourse had occurred and called for a judgment of acquittal.  Judge Walker denied the motion and the defence was set to return the next day to present their case.[14]\nThe defense attorney claimed that the boys were intoxicated and that their taped confessions were inadmissible. However, under cross-examination, David Beagles admitted that his confession was voluntary. The defence tried to present the men as reputable and incapable of committing such a heinous crime. In another attempt to sway the jury, they characterized Owens as a Jezebel, who therefore could not have been raped. The jury read the verdict out loud: \u201cguilty with a recommendation for mercy.\u201d The \u201crecommendation for mercy\u201d part of the sentence kept the four men from facing the electric chair.  Judge Walker deferred sentencing for 15 days and sent the four men to Raiford prison, now Florida State Prison. On June 15, 1959, Judge Walker sentenced all four men to life in prison. Following the sentence, Owens told reporters, \u201cI feel better now for the first time since it happened. For the first time, I feel safe.\u201d[15]\n",

After graduating college she returned to Georgia and wrote columns for both the Atlanta Constitution and Atlanta Journal; at the same time she began her public relations career by handling publicity for the Woman's Club of Atlanta.\nIn the late 1920s, she moved to New York City to develop a dual career in public relations and advertising. She was contracted by various New York City department stores to develop advertising by staging various types of publicity events. In 1932, she was hired by Brooklyn-based Hearn's as a fashion promoter and publicist. Among the publicity events she staged at the store were a fashion contest emceed by gossip columnist and society figure Elsa Maxwell and a Thanksgiving Day circus in Central Park. Bemis wrote the press releases for the events she staged and occasionally made the front page of New York City newspapers herself.\nIn 1938, Bemis resigned from Hearn's to do free-lance public relations for a variety of diverse companies, including the Ford Motor Company, which she worked to promote at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and the Claire Wolff modeling agency.\nIn 1943, Bemis enlisted in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps and was stationed in Daytona Beach, Florida, giving radio addresses and coordinating entertainment at the local U.S.O. She was honorably discharged[when?] with the rank of corporal.\nShe then coordinated a wartime fashion show in New York City sponsored by The New York Times, entitled \"Fashions of the Times\". She then went to Atlanta to become Director of Special Events at Rich's Department Store (1946\u20131947), then back to New York to take a position as Director of Feature Events at Abraham & Straus Department Store, where she worked until 1954.\nIn 1956, Bemis semi-retired to St. Augustine, Florida, where she engaged in charitable work for various causes, worked as a publicist for the city and wrote for several local newspapers.[2]\nOn January 23, 1974, her friend and close neighbor on Marine Street, fellow socialite Athalia Ponsell Lindsley (once engaged to Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.), was hacked to death with a machete on Lindsley's front porch. Another neighbor was indicted and tried for the crime but was acquitted. The investigation into the crime was fraught with controversy and no one else was charged in the murder. Bemis, who may have been gathering information for a book, alluded to the fact that she had information pertinent to the case. On November 3, 1974, she went out for her evening walk and never returned. Her body was discovered about 7 p.m. a block and a half from her house, her skull crushed by a cement block. Her murder, like Ponsell Lindsley's, remains unsolved.[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "The 1987 Tampa riots were two riots in Tampa, Florida that occurred in February and April 1987 that started after two African Americans died in encounters with the police. 1986 & 1987 would also be a time of racial tension in Tampa as well.  \nIt would be similar to nearly 20 years earlier when Tampa was the site of rioting for several days that was started after a 19-year-old African American man named Martin Chambers was shot and killed by a white police officer of the Tampa Police Department, James Calvert.[1]\nDuring a period spanning from November 1986 to April 1987 four African American males would be killed during encounters involving white officers of the Tampa Police Department.[2] At the time, 25% of African Americans who lived in Tampa resided at public housing projects. In the census tracts where the College Hill and Ponce de Leon housing projects, the population of them would increase 17% between 1970 to 1985 which was at twice the rate of other black neighborhoods in the city.[3] In July 1986 the unemployment rate would be reported as being 10.4% for black people in Hillsborough County while for whites it would be at 5.2%.[4]\nBlacks who were middle class would move to different neighborhoods apart from College Hill and Ponce de Leon while white families who lived in the area prior to arrival of blacks in general had moved to the suburbs.[3]\nThe riot started after a 23-year-old African American man named Melvin Eugene Hair who had paranoid schizophrenia would get into a fight with his family and would die after being restrained by the police when they intervened. The fight would start after Hair would start reading cards from other players who were playing a card game. His mother would tell him to stop and then attempted to burn someone with a cigarette. A fight would later break out and a guest would end up calling the police to get him to a mental health center. The guest would say on the phone he had a knife to get a quicker response despite the fact he didn\u2019t have one. Officers who responded would get into a fight in trying to restrain him. Eventually one of the responding officers, David D\u2019Agresta would put Hair into a carotid artery restraint that he had learned when he went to police academy. Later on attempts were made to revive him but it would be unsuccessful.[5]\nThe teenagers who had gathered at the street corner would grow angry because of Hair\u2019s death and a recent news story airing on local TV stations about the city attorney blaming Dwight Gooden with starting a fight with white Tampa police officers. A crowd would start to gather and later became a violent mob that set fire to a dumpster along with rock and bottle throwing starting. The riot would end up lasting for 3 days.[6]\nDuring the evening of February 19 a group of about 200 people would participate in rioting which was first reported as beginning at 8 PM. Approximately 75 police officers wearing riot gear would cordon off the area and one office would be injured after being hit by a brick. The crowd would start to shrink at 11:30 PM according to Mayor Sandy Freeman who visited the scene at 11 PM. Also during the same day, copies about a report pertaining to Gooden's arrest would be released by the city attorney. In the report it stated that officers had unsuccessfully tried to put Gooden into a chokehold when he and 4 others with him fought them.[7]\nA police command center would be set up at the intersections of East Buffalo Avenue and 18th Street. A local grocery store would end up being looted, along with homes occupied by white residents and a McDonald's in the area would be hit by rocks and broken into. With violence escalating the Ku Klux Klan would get involved.[3]\nTampa would hold a mayoral election on March 4, 1987 with incumbent mayor Sandy Freeman winning the 5 way nonpartisan race becoming the first elected female mayor in the city's history. Freeman had served as mayor since July 1986 when Bob Martinez, resigned his position to run for Governor. Freedman would end up winning all of the precincts in the city with the exception of one. She would get 379 votes in the precinct covering College Hill compared to the combined total of 21 for her opponents despite opponents of her attacking her about the riot that happened in College Hill.[8]\n",

It was the deadliest shooting by a single shooter in United States history until the Las Vegas Strip shooting on October 1, 2017.\nBorn in New York to Afghan-American parents, he moved to Florida as a child, where he displayed an interest in violence and had behavioral problems in school, including struggling academically and receiving numerous suspensions.[2] As an adult he drifted through various jobs and a failed marriage before eventually becoming a security guard by profession.[3] Before the shooting, he had been investigated for connections to terrorism by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2013 and 2014. During that period, he was placed on the Terrorist Screening Database, but was subsequently removed.[4] In a call to 9-1-1 during the shooting, Mateen identified himself as \"Mujahideen\", \"Islamic Soldier\", and \"Soldier of God\";[5][6] and pledged his allegiance multiple times to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who at the time was the leader of the militant jihadist group ISIL.[7] He said the shooting was \"triggered\" by an airstrike in Iraq that killed Abu Wahib, an ISIL commander, six weeks before.[8]\nMateen was born Omar Mir Seddique[1] on November 16, 1986,[9] at Long Island Jewish Medical Center[10][11] in New Hyde Park, New York, to Afghan parents. His father, Mir Seddique Mateen, is from Herat[12] who emigrated from Afghanistan in the 1980s[13][14][15] and became a naturalized US citizen on November 17, 1989.[11] Seddique Mateen was a secret informant for the FBI at times between January 2005 and June 2016.[16] Seddique Mateen also owns a non-profit company named The Durand Jirga, Inc. based in Port St. Lucie, Florida, which was founded in 2010 where he hosted a political commentary show[17] that aired on the California-based Payam-e-Afghan television channel,[18] in which he expressed anti-Pakistan views.[19] His mother, Shahla Mateen, was taken into custody after she allegedly attacked her husband while he was brushing his teeth on the night of December 7, 2002.[20] Both of his parents first settled in New York, having four children, including Omar.[21] After being raised in New York for a few years, he moved with his family to Port St. Lucie, Florida in 1991.[12] His family was described as being moderate Muslims and \"all-American.\"[22]\nAt a young age, Mateen displayed a preoccupation with violence, the Associated Press and The Washington Post reported. For his elementary and middle school education, he attended classes in St. Lucie County, Florida. While at Mariposa Elementary School, a third grade teacher wrote that Mateen was \"very active ... constantly moving, verbally abusive, rude, aggressive ... much talk about violence & sex ... hands all over the place \u2013 on other children, in his mouth\". In the seventh grade, Mateen was moved to a separate class with the purpose of avoiding \"conflicts with other students\" and suffered from poor scholarly performance due to \"many instances of behavioral problems\".[23]\nA classmate at Mariposa said that Mateen was a bully, disrespectful to girls and acted like he was better than his classmates. Another classmate reported that Mateen was bullied at school because of his weight and his Afghan heritage. His parents were described as \"dismissive\" of his poor behavior while his father \"had a reputation for being disrespectful of female teachers and dismissive of complaints about his son\".[22] In 1999, while Mateen was in the eighth grade, his teacher sent a letter to his father regarding an \"attitude and inability to show self-control\".[23]\nMateen began his secondary education at Martin County High School in 2000, and at the age of 14 was expelled after being in a fight in math class, where he was briefly arrested without being handcuffed and charged with battery and disrupting school, though the charges were later dropped.[24][25] While a sophomore attending Spectrum, an alternative high school for students with behavioral issues, classmates told The Washington Post that Mateen cheered in support of the hijackers during the September 11 attacks and that he stated that Osama bin Laden was his uncle who taught him how to shoot AK-47s, all of this before knowing that bin Laden was the mastermind of the attacks.[22][23][26] After his outburst, Mateen's father arrived at the school to pick him up and slapped him in the face, with Mateen later being suspended for five days after the incident.[22][23] Soon after the September 11 attacks, \"he shocked other students on his school bus by imitating an exploding plane\", reported The New York Times.[27]\nA retired dean of Martin County High School, Dan Alley, said that they \"tried to counsel him and show him the error of his ways, but it never had the effect that we were hoping for,\" and that his father \"would not back up the school, and he would always take his son's side\".[23] Mateen was later sent to St. Lucie West Centennial High School after getting into a fight with a student.[26][28][29][30][31] By the time Mateen had returned and graduated from Martin County's Stuart Adult Vocational School in 2003, he had been suspended for 48 days for being involved in fights and injuring other students.[12][23]\nMateen attended Indian River State College's Criminal Justice Training program and in a questionnaire, he admitted to committing or being involved in a crime that went undetected, but did not provide specific details. He went on to earn an Associate of Science degree in criminal justice technology from the college in 2006.[12][31][32] He worked in a number of local stores and restaurants while attending school.[12]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJames Edward \"Pop\" Pough (February 16, 1948 \u2013 June 18, 1990) was an American spree killer who killed thirteen people in two separate attacks in Jacksonville, Florida on 17 and 18 June 1990. Pough shot and killed two people at random on Jacksonville\u2019s Northside, wounded two teenagers, and robbed a convenience store. Pough shot and killed nine people and wounded four others at a General Motors Acceptance Corporation (now Ally Financial) car loan office the next day before committing suicide.\nAt the time, the shooting at the GMAC office was the deadliest single mass shooting committed by a lone gunman in Florida history, surpassing the murder of eight machine shop employees in Hialeah by Carl Robert Brown on August 20, 1982.[2]\nJames Edward Pough was born on February 16, 1948, in Jacksonville, Florida, the first of nine children. Pough grew up in an area near Florida Community College at Jacksonville. As a child, Pough suffered from asthma and he had a close relationship with his mother, whom he helped out a lot after his father left the family in 1959. He attended a vocational school, but dropped out in his sophomore year. At the age of 18, he began working as a common laborer, which he remained as until his death. During the last year of his life, he was doing construction maintenance at a brewery.\nAccording to former schoolmates, Pough had affiliations with street gangs during his time at school. He was arrested twice in 1965 for vagrancy, and twice again in 1966, once for attempted robbery and a second time for assault after he attacked a construction worker who owed him a quarter. In 1968, Pough was arrested for dangerously displaying a knife and was fined $75, and in July 1969, he was fined $10 after being charged for gambling. In 1970, he was arrested, but not prosecuted, for motor vehicle theft and vagrancy-prowling by auto.\nOn May 8, 1971, Pough got into an argument with his best friend, David Lee Pender, who had called his girlfriend a \"bitch\". In the following scuffle, Pough grabbed a .38-caliber revolver from his girlfriend's purse and shot Pender three times, who eventually died in a hospital. According to relatives, Pough never managed to get over the fact that he had killed his friend. Pough was initially charged with murder, though the charge was later reduced to manslaughter. In the end, he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to five years probation, but the judgment of his guilt was withheld by the court subject to the successful completion of probation.[3] It was also ruled that Pough should never be allowed to own a gun due to his violent behavior in the past, though this was never forwarded to police. As a result, Pough was not considered a felon and therefore was able to purchase several handguns, among them the R\u00f6hm RG-31 .38-caliber revolver he later used to commit suicide, which was registered with the police on June 4, 1979. In 1977, Pough appeared twice in court for charges of bad debt, and there was also an outstanding warrant for his arrest in a 1982 employment compensation fraud case.\nIn December 1988, Pough traded his old car for a 1988 Pontiac Grand Am, though he soon had difficulties to make his payments. As a result, the car was voluntarily repossessed by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) in January 1990. He received a bill for $6,394 (around $13,200 as of 2021) of outstanding fees in March, and again on April 6, which was the last contact between him and the office. About two months prior to the shootings, Pough purchased a Universal Brand M1 carbine at a local pawnshop.\nPough was living in a rundown duplex in Jacksonville's Northwest Quadrant at the time. He was known by his neighbors as a quiet and nice man who kept a regular and fixed schedule, but also as someone who would become angry fairly quickly and get engaged in enraged conversations, especially in matters concerning money and his car. Relatives described him as a recluse with no friends. After the death of his mother three years prior to the shootings, Pough was said to have emotionally changed for the worse, saying that he had nothing left to live for and arguing that he would \"take someone with him when he leaves this world\". Frequently, he had violent outbursts, which were directed against his wife, Theresa, and twice he threatened her by putting a gun to her head. In January 1990, they separated, as Theresa feared for her safety, and on March 2, she was granted an injunction that disallowed Pough to get in contact with her for a year. As a consequence, he withdrew even more and rarely socialized.[4][5][6][7][8]\nPough started his killing spree in the night of June 17, 1990, at about 12:50\u00a0a.m. Armed with his blanket-wrapped M1 Carbine and not far from his home, he walked up to a group of men standing at a street corner in the Northwest section of Jacksonville, and killed Louis Carl Bacon with two shots in the chest before fleeing. A couple of minutes later, he attacked Doretta Drake who was chatting with two other women in a vacant parking lot just two blocks from the first crime scene. After hitting Drake with his car, throwing her on the sidewalk, Pough stepped out of his Buick and killed her with a single shot to the head before driving away.\n",

        "paragraph": "Gary Michael Hilton (born November 22, 1946),[1] known as the National Forest Serial Killer, is an American serial killer responsible for four known homicides between 2007 and 2008 committed in three states, all of which occurred within the premises of national forests. Sentenced to death in Florida and to life imprisonment in Georgia and North Carolina, Hilton remains a suspect in several other killings, including that of Judy Smith.\nOn October 21, 2007, a retired couple of avid hikers living in Horse Shoe, North Carolina,[2] John and Irene Bryant (80 and 84, respectively), left for a hike through the Pisgah National Forest, leaving their parked maroon Ford Escape at the Yellow Gap Road near U.S. Route 276. After not hearing from them for two weeks, family members reported the couple as missing to the Henderson County Sheriff's Office, who promptly launched a search for the Bryants, consisting of more than 30 volunteers, cadaver dogs and a helicopter. Through examining their phone records, it was learned that Irene had attempted to call 911 on the day of her disappearance, but the signal was lost, and the call was dropped.[3]\nOn November 10, 2007 the search party located the body of a woman on the Barnett Branch trail, covered with leaves. Suspecting that it might belong to Irene, they sent it to the state medical examiner's office in Chapel Hill to perform an autopsy.[4] Three days later, the body was positively identified as that of Irene, who had been bludgeoned to death with a blunt instrument.[5] As this was now considered a homicide perpetrated on federal land, the FBI launched an investigation with an award of $10,000 to whoever could provide information leading to the killer. Simultaneously, it was revealed that a bank card belonging to the Bryants had been used to withdraw $300 from an ATM in Ducktown, Tennessee, with the surveillance cameras showing an older Caucasian man wearing a yellow rainjacket whose hood was obscuring his face.[6] By this time, John was still considered a missing person, possibly abducted by whoever had killed his wife.[7]\nOn February 3, 2008, Mark Waldrop, a hunter, accidentally discovered a skull in Nantahala National Forest, just off the forest service road known as \"The Switchbacks.\"[8] After calling the local deputy for assistance, the duo investigated the scene. Upon closer inspection, a pelvis and spine were located about 20 yards from the skull. Since there was no clothing or identification near the remains, the bones were sent to the medical examiner in Chapel Hill to identify the decedent.[9] After two days, it was positively identified as that of John Bryant.[10]\nOn December 3, 2007, 46-year-old Cheryl Hodges Dunlap, a resident of Crawfordville, Florida, did not appear for her job at the Florida State University in Tallahassee, where she worked as a nurse.[11] Considering this behavior to be unusual, her colleagues reported her missing on the following day, after her abandoned car, a white Toyota Camry, was located north of the county line.[12] Approximately five days later, a search party of around 180 people was organized to help locate her, and despite initially being unable to find anything, the members still hoped that they would locate Dunlap alive.[13]\nOn December 16, 2007 Ronnie Rentz, a hunter passing through the woods in the Apalachicola National Forest with his dogs, discovered the decapitated, decomposing body of a white woman, immediately reporting the finding to the state authorities.[14] As they were initially unsure whether the body was Dunlap's,[15] it was sent to the medical examiner, who confirmed that it was indeed hers via DNA profiling.[16] Classifying her death as a homicide, authorities announced that they were looking for a suspicious green truck seen in the area around the time Dunlap disappeared,[17] driven by a man who had used her ATM card five times in Tallahassee, withdrawing $700 from her account. Over the next few days, numerous tips were submitted to the police,[18] some of which were about a strange homeless man with a dog who was driving a green 2001 Chevrolet Astro van, but this lead did not lead to an arrest.[19] Around this time, rumors began circulating that a serial offender was operating between Georgia and Florida. Still, at the time, the Leon County Sheriff's Office stated that they were investigating the case as an isolated homicide.[20]\nOn New Year's Day of 2008, 24-year-old sales manager Meredith Hope Emerson decided to go for a hike along the Freeman Trail on Blood Mountain, in Vogel State Park. She was accompanied by her dog, Ella, and according to several witnesses, they had observed a mysterious older man with his dog following her. On January 3, 2008, authorities located her 1995 Chevrolet Cavalier, where they found various items such as her water bottle, a dog leash, and a police baton.[21]\nThat day further investigation into the man seen following Emerson revealed that he was 61-year-old Gary Hilton, a local drifter known for his strange behavior and vicious temper. He often walked his dog Dandy along the trail.[22] Since this revelation, he was announced as a person of interest in the case, with police requesting that they officially interrogate him about the case.[23][24] A day after this announcement, Emerson's dog Ella was found wandering at a Kroger parking lot and returned to her family members.[25]\nOn January 5, 2008 authorities located numerous items belonging to Emerson inside a dumpster near a QuikTrip parking lot in Cumming: her bloodied clothing, wallet, driver's license, a University of Georgia ID card and a bloodstained car seat belt.[26]\n",

        "paragraph": "Guy Morrell Bradley (April 25, 1870\u00a0\u2013 July 8, 1905) was an American game warden and deputy sheriff for Monroe County, Florida.  Born in Chicago, Illinois, he relocated to Florida with his family when he was young.  As a boy, he often served as guide to visiting fishermen and plume hunters, although he later denounced poaching after legislation was passed to protect the dwindling number of birds.  In 1902, Bradley was hired by the American Ornithologists' Union, at the request of the Florida Audubon Society, to become one of the country's first game wardens.\nTasked with protecting the area's wading birds from hunters, he patrolled the area stretching from Florida's west coast, through the Everglades, to Key West, single-handedly enforcing the ban on bird hunting.[1]  Bradley was shot and killed in the line of duty, after confronting a man and his two sons who were hunting egrets in the Everglades.  His much-publicized death at the age of 35 galvanized conservationists and served as inspiration for future legislation to protect Florida's bird populations.  Several national awards and places have been named in his honor.\nGuy Bradley was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1870. His family had strong ties to the city; his father, Edwin Ruthven Bradley, was born there in 1840, and two members of the family held high positions in Chicago's law enforcement.[2]  Six years after Guy's birth, the family relocated to Florida.  After making their home in smaller towns, the family eventually settled in Fort Lauderdale, where Edwin became keeper of the Fort Lauderdale House of Refuge.  Shortly after the death of Bradley's sister Flora from an unknown illness\u2014which also affected Guy, leaving him ill for several years\u2014the family moved to the vicinity of Lake Worth.[3] Edwin became a postman, earning an annual wage of six hundred dollars.  He, with the help of his oldest son, later received national attention for being one of several barefoot mailmen, who operated until a road was constructed in 1892.[4]\nThe family then relocated to Miami, where Edwin served as superintendent of the Dade County school district.  In 1885, fifteen-year-old Guy and his older brother Louis served as scouts for noted French plume hunter Jean Chevalier on his trip to the Everglades.[5]  Accompanied by their friend Charlie W. Pierce, the men set sail on Pierce's craft, the Bonton, ending their journey in Key West.  At the time, plume feathers\u2014selling for more than $20 an ounce ($501 in 2011)\u2014were reportedly more valuable than gold.[6]  On their expedition, which lasted several weeks, the young men and Chevalier's party killed 1,397 individual birds of thirty-six different species.[7]\nAt the turn of the 20th century, vast numbers of birds were being killed in order to provide feathers to decorate women's hats.  The fashion craze, which began in the 1870s, became so prominent that by 1886 birds were being killed for the millinery trade at a rate of five million a year; many species faced extinction as a result.[8]  In Florida, plume birds were first driven away from the most populated areas in the northern part of the state, and forced to nest further south.  Rookeries concentrated in and around the Everglades area, which had abundant food and seasonal dry periods, ideal for nesting birds.  By the late 1880s, there were no longer any large numbers of plume birds within reach of Florida's most settled cities.[9]\nThe most popular plumes came from various species of wading birds, known as \"little snowies\" for their snowy-white feathers; even more prized were the \"nuptial plumes\", grown during mating season and displayed by birds during courtship.[10]  Poachers often stole into the densely populated rookeries, where they would shoot and then pluck the roosting birds clean, leaving their carcasses to rot.  Unprotected eggs became easy prey for predators, as were newly hatched birds, who also starved or died from exposure.  One ex-poacher would later write of the practice, \"The heads and necks of the young birds were hanging out of the nests by the hundreds.  I am done with bird hunting forever!\"[11]\nIn the mid-1890s, Edwin became head of the Florida Coast Line Canal and Transportation Company and then the Model Land Company, both of which sold land for the railroads.[12]  In 1900, after twenty years living in Lake Worth, the family moved to Flamingo in Monroe County, near the Everglades.  Edwin had heard that railroad tycoon Henry Flagler planned to build his railroad through the area, and that the then primitive city of Flamingo would flourish as a result; Flagler later changed his mind, deciding to build to Key West instead.[4]  Guy and his brother, who continued working as guides and hunters, each received a quarter of a mile of land on Florida Bay as part of their father's deal with the Model Land Company.[12]  While working variously as a postman, farmer and boatman during his 20s, Guy continued to augment his income with an occasional plume hunt.[13]  In 1899, he married the young widow Sophronia (\"Fronie\") Vickers Kirvin from Key West.  Their first child, Morrell, was born a year later.[14]\nWhen the Florida legislature passed the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) model law to outlaw the killing of plume birds, this created a need for qualified and competent wardens to enforce it.  Kirk Munroe, a friend of the Bradley family and a founding vice president of the Florida Audubon Society, recommended Guy for the position.  Seen as different from the other \"wild\" young men in Flamingo, Bradley was described as \"pleasant, quiet\u2026 fair, with blue eyes, always whistling and a pretty good violinist\u2026 [a] social asset to the isolated, frontier community, clean-cut, reliable, courageous, energetic and conscientious\".[4]\nBradley was at this time a reformed plume hunter, who had given up the profession after the passage of the Lacey Act of 1900.  In a letter to William Dutcher, president of the Florida Audubon Society, Bradley wrote \"I used to hunt plume birds, but since the game laws were passed, I have not killed a plume bird.  For it is a cruel and hard calling not withstanding being unlawful.  I make this statement upon honor.\"[15]  Soon after being accepted for the position, Bradley traveled to Key West to secure his appointment as both game warden and deputy sheriff, which gave him the authority to arrest those hunting illegally.[16]\n",

A lone gunman, David Katz, shot and killed two people and injured another ten before committing suicide.[1][4]\nThe GLHF (Good Luck Have Fun) Game Bar, a video game venue in the Jacksonville Landing indoor marketplace, hosted a Madden NFL 19 video gaming tournament on August 26, 2018, with around 130 to 150 participants and onlookers.[9] After one of the participants, David Katz, lost a game, he refused to shake the hand of the winner and left the tournament. Soon after, he returned with one of the two handguns he had brought to the event.[10]\nKatz fired 12 shots,[11] killing two people and wounding ten others, then committed suicide. One more sustained injuries while fleeing.[12][13][6] A tournament announcer said that he had been interviewing the first victim before he was fatally shot, and that he had been intentionally targeted. The gunman then turned and began shooting indiscriminately.[14]\nGunfire was first reported on social media at 1:34 pm EDT by tournament participants.[15][16] The event's Twitch stream recorded footage of the shooting, which was later uploaded to YouTube.[17]\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff's Office urged individuals to stay away from the location at 2:13\u00a0p.m. EDT, and SWAT officers evacuated and searched the area.[18] First responders arrived on the scene within two minutes of the first 911 call, and arrived at 1:36 pm EDT.[19] The president of the firefighters union told reporters that they were training in the area when victims had run up to them for help.[20] Due to the location being next to the St. Johns River, the Coast Guard was called in to sweep the surrounding waterways.[13]\nEleven people were taken to hospitals for treatment of their injuries. Some of the injured had been able to leave the bar and sought assistance from first responders.[25] Two others had driven themselves to the hospital.[4] Of those injured, ten individuals received gunshot wounds and one person was injured attempting to flee from the location.[26] The day after the incident Memorial Hospital released a statement that one individual had minor injuries, and three were in good condition, and UF Health announced that four victims had been released, with two still admitted.[27]\nThe shooter, David Katz, was a 24-year-old professional Madden player from Baltimore, Maryland, who had been attending the Jacksonville tournament as a participant.[28] Katz had lost a few rounds in the competition, which prevented him from reaching the finals. Fellow competitors reported that he had been \"acting weird\" and refused to shake hands with them after losing the competition.[29] His pseudonyms included \"Bread\", \"mrslicedbread\", \"RavensChamp\", \"ravens2012champ\" and \"TREXHAVAHARTATAK\".[30][31][32] He had previously won $10,000 in a 2017 Madden Tournament. Katz had a history of mental illness and was prescribed anti-psychotic medicine.[33] He was diagnosed with dysthymia and oppositional disorder not otherwise specified and had been involuntarily  committed to mental hospitals on numerous occasions.[34]\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff's Office used Twitter to announce that there were fatalities at the scene at 2:45\u00a0p.m. EDT,[35] and that one suspect was dead at the scene at 2:53\u00a0p.m. EDT.[36] Initially, it was unknown whether there were additional gunmen,[13] but later, officials confirmed that there was only one suspect in the shooting.[37] He was armed with a .45 caliber handgun and a 9mm handgun, with the Sheriffs Office stating that one of the weapons was equipped with an aftermarket laser sight attached to the trigger guard.[10] The weapons had been stored in his vehicle, and purchased legally in Baltimore, Maryland.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nAdam John Walsh (November 14, 1974 \u2013 July 27, 1981) was an American child who was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall in Hollywood, Florida, on July 27, 1981. His severed head was found two weeks later in a drainage canal alongside Highway 60\u00a0/ Yeehaw Junction in rural Indian River County, Florida. His death garnered national interest and was made into the 1983 television film Adam, seen by 38 million people in its original airing.[3]\nAdam's father, John Walsh, became an advocate for victims of violent crimes and was the host of the television program America's Most Wanted and, later, In Pursuit with John Walsh.[4] Convicted serial killer Ottis Toole confessed to Adam's murder, but was never convicted of the crime because evidence was reportedly lost and Toole later recanted his confession. Toole died in prison of liver failure on September 15, 1996.[5] No new evidence has come to light since then, and police announced on December 16, 2008, that the Walsh case was closed and that they were satisfied that Toole was the killer.\nOn the afternoon of July 27, 1981, Adam accompanied his mother Rev\u00e9 on a shopping trip to the Hollywood Mall (today Hollywood Hills Plaza) in Hollywood, Florida (26\u00b000\u203246\u2033N 80\u00b010\u203230\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff26.012847\u00b0N 80.175005\u00b0W\ufeff / 26.012847; -80.175005). They went to Sears, entering through the north entrance.[6][7] Rev\u00e9 intended to inquire about a lamp that was on sale[8] and left Adam at a kiosk with Atari 2600 video games on display, where several other boys were taking turns playing them.[9] Rev\u00e9 completed her business in the lamp department around 12:15\u00a0p.m.[6][10] She said that she returned to find that Adam and the other boys had disappeared. A store manager informed her that a scuffle had broken out over whose turn it was at the kiosk, and a security guard demanded that the boys leave the store.[11] The security guard asked the older boys if their parents were present, and they said that they were not.[12] Adam's parents later conjectured that their son had been too shy to speak to the security guard, who presumed that he was in the company of the other boys and made him leave by the same door by which the boys had entered (the Sears west entrance). His parents believe that after the other boys dispersed, he was left alone outside the store at an exit unfamiliar to him.[13][12][14] Meanwhile, unable to find Adam in the toy department, Rev\u00e9 had him paged over the public-address system and continued to look for him throughout the store.[15] By coincidence, she ran into her mother-in-law Jean, who helped her search for him.[16] After more than 90 minutes of searching and paging failed to locate Adam, Rev\u00e9 called the Hollywood Police at 1:55\u00a0p.m.[6]\nOn August 10, a severed head was found in a drainage canal alongside the Florida Turnpike near Vero Beach, almost 130 miles (210 kilometers) from Hollywood, by detective Ralph E. Latimer Jr. and an unidentified deputy of the Indian River County sheriff's office.[17][18] Indian River County and St. Lucie County divers searched the canal.[17] On the morning of August 11, John and Rev\u00e9 appeared on national television saying that they still hoped that Adam was alive. A US$100,000 (equivalent to $298,060 in 2021) reward was posted for Adam's safe return.[19] Soon after, the recovered remains were identified as Adam's.[20]\nThe coroner ruled that the cause of Adam's death was asphyxiation. The state of the remains suggested that Adam had died several days before the discovery of his head. The rest of his body was never recovered.[5] The head, itself, would be kept in the morgue until the case's closure in 2008.[21]\nJohn and Rev\u00e9 knew that the Hollywood police department had botched the treatment of Adam's disappearance, first with the missing-person investigation, and then with the murder investigation.[22]\nAfter some investigation, police eventually concluded that Adam was abducted by a drifter named Ottis Toole near the front exterior of Sears after being instructed to leave by a security guard. Toole said that he had lured Adam into his white 1971 Cadillac (which had a damaged right bumper) with promises of toys and candy, then proceeded to drive north on Interstate 95 toward his home in Jacksonville. According to Toole, Adam, at first docile and compliant, began to panic as they drove on. Toole punched him in the face, but as this just made the situation worse, he then \"walloped him unconscious.\" While Adam was unconscious, Toole drove north on the Florida Turnpike to a deserted service road just north of the Radebaugh Road overpass in northwest St. Lucie County (27\u00b032\u203207\u2033N 80\u00b036\u203235\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff27.535352\u00b0N 80.609690\u00b0W\ufeff / 27.535352; -80.609690).[23] When Toole realized that Adam was still breathing, he strangled him to death with a seat belt, dragged him out of the car and decapitated him with a machete. Toole also claimed to have incinerated the body in an old refrigerator when he returned to Jacksonville. He claimed that he wanted to make Adam his adopted son, but that was not deemed feasible. The source of the blood found in Toole's car could not be identified.[5] The police ultimately lost the bloodstained carpet from the car, the machete said to have been used to decapitate Adam and, eventually, the car itself. Toole, a confidant of convicted serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, repeatedly confessed and then retracted accounts of his involvement.[citation needed]\nToole was never charged in Adam's case, although he provided seemingly accurate descriptions as to how he committed the crime. The 2019 Netflix miniseries The Confession Killer shows footage of him apparently being fed information from interrogators and he later confessed to several cases he had no involvement in.[24]  Several witnesses also placed him in the Hollywood area in the days leading up to Adam's disappearance.[5] In September 1996, he died in prison of cirrhosis at the age of 49 while serving a life sentence for other crimes.[12] Later, his niece told John Walsh that he made a deathbed confession to Adam's murder.[12][25] His confession was viewed as unreliable, as he and Lucas confessed to or implicated themselves in more than 200 homicides.[26] Most of Lucas' confessions were later revealed to have been false, having been coerced by the Texas Rangers.[27]\n",

        "paragraph": "The 1986 FBI Miami shootout occurred on April 11, 1986, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, U.S. (the specific area was incorporated as Pinecrest in 1996), when a small group of field agents for the FBI attempted to apprehend William Russell Matix and Michael Lee Platt, who were suspected of committing a series of violent crimes in and around the Miami metropolitan area.\nAlthough they had partially surrounded the suspects after maneuvering them off a local road, the agents involved quickly found their firepower was outmatched by the weapons which Matix and Platt had in their vehicle. During the gun battle which ensued, Platt in particular was able to repeatedly return fire despite sustaining multiple hits. Two Special Agents died from their wounds, while five other agents were injured by gunfire. The shootout ended when both Matix and Platt were killed.\nThe incident is infamous as one of the most violent episodes in the history of the FBI and is often studied in law enforcement training. The scale of the shootout led to the introduction of more effective handguns, primarily switching from revolvers to semi-automatics, in the FBI and many police departments around the United States.\nMichael Lee Platt (February 3, 1954 \u2013 April 11, 1986) and William Russell Matix (June 25, 1951 \u2013 April 11, 1986) met while serving in the U.S. Army at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\nMatix first served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1969 to 1972, working as a cook (MOS 3371) in the officers' mess, serving in Hawaii and Okinawa from April 1970 to March 1971 and April 1971 to March 1972 respectively. He was honorably discharged July 7, 1972, achieving the rank of Sergeant. He enlisted in the U.S. Army on August 10, 1973, serving with the military police under the 101st Airborne Division in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He served as a Military Police Officer and Squad Leader; Guard Supervisor for the Post Stockade and finally Patrol Supervisor before his honorable discharge August 9, 1976.[1]\nPlatt enlisted in the Army 27 June 1972 as an infantryman. While in basic training, Platt applied for Army Airborne Ranger Training and subsequently entered Air Assault School at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. On completion of air assault school, Platt was assigned to the Military Police Unit. It was in this unit that he met and served with Matix. This is also where he met his first wife, Regina Lylen. He was honorably discharged in 1979.[1]\nBoth men's former wives had died under violent circumstances.[2] Matix's wife, Patricia Mary (n\u00e9e  Buchanich) Matix, and a female co-worker, Joyce McFadden, both cancer researchers, were found stabbed to death on December 30, 1983, at Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where both women worked.[3] Both were found murdered in the hospital laboratory. They had been bound and gagged with their throats slashed.[1] Matix reportedly told investigators he suspected Platt had carried on an affair with his wife. Matix was a suspect in the murders but was never charged.[4]\nAfter his wife's death, Matix moved to Florida at Platt's urging, and the two founded Yankee Clipper Tree Trimming Service, a landscaping and tree removal business.[5] In May 1985, Matix married Christy Lou Horne, who moved out of the house two months later when Matix became enraged after learning she was pregnant. She would give birth to their son after Matix's death.[6][7]\nOn December 21, 1984, Platt's wife, Regina, whom he had married nine years earlier in 1975, was found dead from a single shotgun blast to the mouth. Her death was ruled a suicide.[8] He married his second wife, Brenda Horne, in January 1985.[citation needed]\n",

        "paragraph": "\n\"God Control\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Madonna from her fourteenth studio album, Madame X (2019). It was written by Madonna, longtime collaborator Mirwais, and American musician Casey Spooner. Madonna and Mirwais produced the song along with Mike Dean. Lyrically the song talks about gun control and also touches on the political climate of the United States at the time. It is an experimental pop, disco, hi-NRG and electropop song and features the Tiffin Children's Chorus repeating \"We lost god control\" all throughout. In the music video, we can see Madonna typing \"we lost gun control\" and not \"god control\" as the song title suggests.\nIt received positive reviews from music critics, who deemed it one of the best songs of the album. On June 26, an accompanying music video directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund was released; it interspersed footage of Madonna as her alter ego Madame X with scenes of a nightclub where a shooting takes place. The video was reminiscent of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting and was criticized by the media and the survivors of the massacre. However, it was praised by some gun control advocates. Madonna performed \"God Control\" during her appearance at Stonewall 50 \u2013 WorldPride NYC 2019, and as the opening number of her 2019\u221220 Madame X Tour.\nIn 2017, Madonna relocated to Lisbon, Portugal, seeking a top soccer academy for her son David, who wanted to become a professional soccer player.[1] While living in the city, she began meeting artists, painters and musicians, who would invite her to \"living room sessions\". In these sessions, they would bring food, sit around the table and musicians would start playing instruments, singing fado and samba music.[1] Finding herself \"connected through music\", the singer decided to create an album; \"I found my tribe [in Lisbon] and a magical world of incredible musicians that reinforced my belief that music across the world is truly all connected and is the soul of the universe\".[1][2] On April 15, 2019, Madonna revealed Madame X as the album's title. For the album, she worked with longtime collaborator Mirwais Ahmadza\u00ef, who had previously worked on her albums Music (2000), American Life (2003) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), as well as Mike Dean, who served as a producer on Rebel Heart (2015), and Diplo.[3]\n\"God Control\" was written by Madonna and Mirwais and produced by the latter two along with Mike Dean.[4] It has been described as an experimental pop, disco, hi-NRG and electropop song.[5][6][7][8] Lyrically, it talks about gun control, as well as democracy and the political state of the United States.[7] Musically, it's been described as an \"euphoric, densely layered samba-disco-gospel mash-up\" with violins and a retro sound.[9][10] It features a gospel choir, gunshot sounds and vocodered vocals.[5] The song begins with Madonna singing \"Everybody knows the damn truth/Our nation lied and lost respect\" in a \"clenched teeth\" style,[11] followed by the Tiffin Children's Chorus[4] repeating the phrase \"we lost gun control\" in a \"creepy\" way.[6] It is followed by a \"schmaltzy\" chorus inspired by Philadelphia soul in which Madonna sings \"It's a hustle\" amid \"zany\" backing verses about \"a new democracy\".[12] On one particular section, there is a rap that features the artists using a \"cheesy\" accent\u00a0\u2013 compared by some critics to the vocal style she used on her 1990 album I'm Breathless and electronic duo Daft Punk\u00a0\u2013 to sing \"Each new birthday gives me hope / that's why I don't smoke that dope\" and talks about her brain being \"her only friend\".[6][7]\nIn November 2019, Casey Spooner claimed he had been a co-writer on \"God Control\" but was never credited or compensated for it.[13] Spooner said he had created the song's melody when Mirwais asked him to rewrite the lyrics and mix the audio of a demo for his solo album, in which he wanted to sing in English about American politics.[14] Soon afterwards, Mirwais abandoned the project to go work with Madonna; Spooner expressed interest in working with the singer but never received a response.[14] When Spooner first heard the melody to \"God Control\", he felt it was too similar to the one he had created and accused the producer of using his work without permission; he then posted a snippet, comparing both songs, on his Instagram account.[14] According to Spooner, once Madonna heard this, she contacted him claiming she was unaware of his contributions, and offered him $10,000 as an advance\u00a0\u2013 which was later increased to $25,000\u00a0\u2013 as well as 15% of writing credits and royalties. Spooner turned this down, as he claimed he would only receive $10,000 of the $25,000 settlement after covering taxes and his legal fees.[15] He also claimed that \"there's no money in record sales. Not even for Madonna\", and demanded he be paid 1% of the singer's touring profits to \"cover [my] contribution and damages\".[14]\nThe track received positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, wrote that \"darkness hangs heavy [on the album], surfacing fiercely in the clenched-mouth phrasing on 'God Control'.\"[16] Variety's Jeremy Helligar deemed it, alongside previous track \"Dark Ballet\", as one of the moments in Madame X where \"true weirdness sets in\", and \"the closest Madonna may ever come to her own 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.\"[17] Ben Beaumont-Thomas, from The Guardian, called it one of the album's \"shockers suitable only for schadenfreude lovers or scholars of extreme camp.\" He further concluded that \"it is\u00a0\u2013 only just\u00a0\u2013 brilliant, and will become an equally beloved and despised curio among fans\".[7] Mike Wass from Idolator, said it was a \"daring, successful experiment\u00a0... sprawling and perhaps unnecessarily baroque, but it burns with ambitious and anger. And still manages to be pop\".[18] Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield hailed it as \"a rare moment of Madonna understatement\".[19] Louise Bruton from The Irish Times, stated that the song is \"an experimental stand against authoritarianism and gun control through distorted Black Mirror-style pop\u00a0... to basically shake our shoulders and tell us to wake up, sheeple\".[5] Samuel R. Murrian from Parade ranked it at number 96 on his list of the singer's 100 greatest songs.[9] According to Nicolas Hautman from Us Weekly, \"God Control\" is Madonna's \"most daring and epic\" song since 2012's \"Gang Bang\".[20]\nGay Times' Daniel Megarry deemed it \"creative, dance-able and unexpected\u00a0... pure perfection\", as well as the best song on the album.[21] Jonny Coleman from The Hollywood Reporter called the track a \"a six-plus-minute odyssey\".[22] Paper's Bradley Stern described it as a \"happy-go-lucky disco ode to gun control\".[23] While reviewing Madame X for The Independent, Alexandra Pollard said \"God Control\" was an \"attack on America's feeble gun-control laws\".[24] Sal Cinquemani, from Slant Magazine, opined it was the \"album's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance\", as well as \"the most exhilaratingly batshit thing she's done in years\".[10] For The Atlantic's Spencer Kornhaber, it felt \"like a few songs in one\". Nonetheless, he called it an \"irresistible take on Philadelphia soul\" and praised it for being both \"a camp commentary on the way people can dance in the face of crisis\" and \"catchy and amusing\".[12] Wren Graves, from online magazine Consequence of Sound, listed \"God Control\" as one of the standout tracks in Madame X; \"Madonna's ambitions aren't merely musical. Several songs [on the album] contain social messages with varying amounts of bite\u00a0... But the message is even better expressed on the ambitious 'God Control'.\"[25] HuffPost's Daniel Welsh opined it was one of the album's \"party tracks tinged with sadness\".[26] Robbie Barnett from the Washington Blade compared it to Madonna's 2000 songs \"Music\" and \"Impressive Instant\", calling it \"perfectly fit for dance floor consumption\", the singer's best dance track since \"Hung Up\" (2005), as well as the best song on the album.[11] On a less favorable note, Rich Juzwiak from Pitchfork said it was \"supposed to be fun, but it's exhausting\".[6]\nDuring an interview with People, Madonna said one of the main reasons she made a video for \"God Control\" were her kids; \"I send my children to school with the same fear every mother in this era has [...] It's really scary to me that the once-safe spaces where we gather, worship and learn are targets. Nobody's safe\".[27] In another statement, she said that also wanted to draw attention to an ongoing problem in America.[28] Regarding those who could criticize it for being too graphic, she answered: \"this is what happens. Guns kill\".[27]\n",

He was born in 1951 in Baltimore.[3]\nOn July 9, 1985, Benson placed a pipe bomb in the family car, in which Margaret, Scott, and Steven's sister, Carol Lynn Benson Kendall (a former Miss Florida runner-up), were waiting for Benson to join them when the Chevrolet Suburban exploded.[4] Kendall survived but was badly burned; Margaret and Scott died instantly from the bomb blast. Represented by attorney Michael McDonnell, Steven Benson was ultimately convicted of first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, and arson of a dwelling.[5] He avoided the death penalty, and was sentenced to two life terms in prison.[6][7] Over the course of his sentence, Benson was transferred to various prisons because of constant threats and abuse from other inmates.[8]\nBenson died at Taylor Correctional Institution in Perry, Florida of a stab wound to the right side of the head with a homemade knife on July 3, 2015.[9][10] Benson was in a long running feud with Cordell Washington, another inmate at the facility. The feud went back to at least 2012 after a series of assaults by Washington. Inmates told investigators that Washington planned to extort $1,000 from Benson within days after arriving at Taylor Correctional Institution. When Benson refused to pay, Washington and another man, identified as Marvin Taylor, ambushed and shanked Benson.[11] Washington was charged with murder for killing Benson, but was acquitted.[12]\nDominick Dunne's investigative crime show Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice devoted an hour for the case of Steven Benson.[13]\nBenson is also featured in an episode of the New Detectives entitled \"Short Fuse\" (Season 2, Episode 3) and an episode of Florida Man Murders entitled \"Killer Succession\" (Season 1, Episode 3).[citation needed] The case was featured in Great Crimes and Trials and Infamous Murders.

Randall is currently an inmate in the Charlotte Correctional Institute serving out two life sentences.[1] \nHe has been described as a \"notorious criminal\".[2]\nRandall was a chief suspect in the 1984 death of Boston resident Holly Jean Cote, whose death by strangulation was never solved. Cote was a friend of Randall's then-wife, Linda Randall.[3] Cote was last seen alive in the area of Gardner, Massachusetts on March 4, 1984. Her body was found in early May in a marsh near Birch Hill Dam in Royalston, Massachusetts.[4]  His suspected involvement in Cote's death is based on statements Randall made to his then-wife and to mental health workers during interactions he had with psychiatric services in late 1984, and on the fact that Cote's body was recovered in a fishing area Randall was known to frequent.[5] Randall was never charged with an offence relating to Cote's death but evidence relating to the investigation was raised in the subsequent Evans/Pugh murder trial.\nIn the late 1980s a Massachusetts court convicted James Randall of an incident of sexual battery of Linda Randall, which occurred on July 18, 1986.[5]  Later the same year James was convicted of two counts of sexual battery and one count of kidnapping, also relating to Linda Randall.[6] He was sentenced to five to seven years imprisonment for these offences and spent time in a Massachusetts prison until his release in 1992. After his release Randall moved to Florida and got a job as a window installer.[1]\nOn October 20, 1995, Wendy Evans, a suspected Florida sex worker, was killed by strangulation; her naked body was found on Myrtle Lane in Oldsmar by a pizza delivery driver later the same day.  On January 18, 1996, Cynthia Pugh, another Florida prostitute, was also killed by strangulation, her body being discovered on January 19, 1996.[5]\nPolice identified James Randall as a person of interest in relation to both deaths after finding tire marks that matched Randall's Dodge D-50 pick-up truck. Police went to speak to Randall on June 27, 1996, at his residence. Following that conversation police observed Randall leaving his premises in his truck and attempted to stop him to ask further questions, but Randall instead accelerated away from police and a high-speed chase between Randall and police followed. Following the conclusion of the chase Randall continued to flee on foot and escaped, although he was eventually found and detained four days later (July 1, 1996).[7]\nPolice investigations revealed that Randall had a history of engaging in consensual erotic asphyxiation with his sexual partners, along with allegations of non-consensual violent attacks on his then-girlfriend Terry-Jo Howard involving in part attempts to choke her.[5]\nIn April 1997 Randall was convicted by a Florida jury of first-degree murder in the strangulation deaths of both women. Sentencing judge Susan Schaeffer found three aggravating factors in the offence, being (1) that Randall had a previous conviction for a felony, (2) that the previous conviction was for a violent felony, and (3) that the murders were especially heinous, callous or cruel.[5] Taking these factors into account, the court sentenced Randall to two death sentences in relation to the murders.[8] He was also sentenced to a concurrent sentence of five years on a charge of evading police.[7]\nRandall appealed the murder convictions; his appeal was heard by the Supreme Court of Florida in 2000.  The court upheld the appeals and found that Randall had most likely choked Evans and Pugh for pleasure, not to kill them.  Accordingly, the conviction for first-degree murder was replaced with a conviction for second-degree murder in relation to both deaths, and his death sentences were changed to sentences of life imprisonment.[5] Randall is held in Taylor C. I. Annex, Perry, Florida.\nThe murders of Evans and Pugh have been featured on true crime television shows including Forensic Files (season 6, \"Treads and Threads\"); The New Detectives (season 6, \"Left at the Scene\"); and Evil Lives Here (season 4, \"In the Lion's Cage\").\n",

On the day of his execution, Hampton confessed to a further three murders committed in Georgia and South Carolina years prior.[1]\nLittle to nothing is known about Hampton's childhood. According to his confession, he committed his first murder in 1887, that of a train conductor while aboard a freight train in Lexington County, South Carolina.[1] Being a drifter, Hampton had left the state not long after, successfully evading capture and not becoming a suspect.\nDuring the years after, Hampton moved to Georgia, where he committed two more murders, but would not elaborate on the victims.[2] By 1893, Hampton was working at a turpentine camp in Fort White, Florida. On March 25 of that year, Hampton shot at three Caucasian men; Sessom Calhoun and John Bell were killed while J. W. Holliday, the third man, was wounded but survived.[3] Shortly after, Hampton was arrested and charged with the two murders. Subsequently, he was tried and convicted on two counts of first degree murder, and was sentenced to hang.[3]\nDue to an outcry of threats, governor William Sherman Jennings assigned state troopers to protect Hampton, who was African American, from a possible lynching.[4] On December 2, 1901, governor Jennings signed a death warrant which scheduled Hampton to be execution on December 6. On that day, Hampton was hanged at Lake City.[5] Shortly before his execution, Hampton, who was smoking a cigarette, made a statement in which he confessed to the previous three murders.[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "Gene Berkowitz\nThe 1968 Tallahassee riots were one of many riots that broke out after Martin Luther King was assassinated in Tallahassee, Florida lasting from April 5\u20137, 1968. It was originally a student protest but later became a riot as a result of the rage and anger of participants. The riot happened at Florida A & M University but unrest would be seen to a lesser extent in the Frenchtown neighborhood.[1]\nTallahassee was described as having a population of about 68,000 with 25% of the population being African-American in 1968. It was also Florida's state capital.\nThere were two state universities in the city: Florida State University (FSU) and the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU). FAMU was a historically black university while FSU was an all white university until 1962.[1] The hospital at FAMU's campus started to lose federal funding in 1965 because the university's hospital was not admitting white patients despite most of the staff being white. Tallahassee Memorial Hospital eventually started to admit black patients to try and not lose federal funding which led to drawing away middle-class African American patients who could pay and had the right insurance coverage to choose TMH over FAMU's hospital. The hospital began to fall into bad financial grounds as it could not attract patients who were either white or African American. In 1967 the county and municipal government took over control of the hospital. The hospital itself became a point of contention for students, alumni and faculty at FAMU who felt that the University's President William Gore, Jr. did not fight hard enough in their eyes to protect the hospital. Also in 1967, there were talks of merging the university with FSU. By February 1968 students had created several black power groups and created a student newspaper named UHURU as they felt the university needed to be protected.[2]\nTallahassee saw action during the Civil Rights Movement. The 1956 Tallahassee bus boycott was eventually successful in desegregating the bus system in the city.[1][3] What caused the boycott was when 2 African-American students from FAMU, Wilhelmina Jakes and Carrier Patterson sat in the whites only section where there was the only 2 vacant seats left and were asked to either move to back of the bus and stand  in the back or leave the bus without getting their fares back. Starting on May 28 the boycott ran until December 22.[4]\nA chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality was created at FAMU after two students from there went to the University of Miami  during the summer of 1959 and entered a chapter at a CORE workshop at the University of Miami  and ended up bringing it back to FAMU. After the CORE chapter was created, a series of events like picketing and sit-ins were done by them with mixed results. The events did not receive that much publicity and there is little known about them.[3]\nThere was a series of sit-ins protests in the city between 1960 and 1961.[1] The sit-ins began on February 13, 1960 when a combination of 8 high school and FAMU students held a sit-in at a local Woolworth store's counter for 2.5 hours that day. No arrests were reported in the sit-in that day. Another sit-in was held on February 20. This time 11 students participated and a police squad led by the mayor asked them to leave. The protesters refused and were arrested. Reverend Daniel B. Speed bailed the students out and the protestors were arrested under the charge of disturbing the peace by riotous conduct along with unlawful assembly. They were all found guilty in court and were offered the option of paying a $300 fine or doing 60 service days. All but three of the students chose service.[3]\nThe sit-in protests would continue to grow in size and the resistance they faced as well. During March 5 and 12 protests, students who were white from FSU joined in with the black students from FAMU. 240 students were arrested in the two protests. During March 12 a thousand students from FAMU going in groups of 75 each went to the downtown area with posters and wanted the students who were arrested to be released. A \"Local Citizen Council\" prevented them from entering a store as a group of white men who were armed in one instance. Students gathered in response to the large amount of arrests. The mayor announced that the group had three minutes to disperse but before the time was up, the police used tear gas with several females being hospitalized after receiving burns. State government officials thought that the protests would weaken the Florida Interracial Committee and that they would end making the Democratic gubernatorial primaries more favorable for a segregationist candidate, Farris Bryant. The sit-ins themselves were not effective in accomplishing theire goals.[3]\nStudents at the FAMU first reacted to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. with sadness later followed by anger. Student protests became violent within a few hours with bottles and rocks being thrown at cars that were driving by along with gunfire. A white youth got a bleeding ear after his car was attacked and was the first person to be injured. The Southern Mobile Homes Brokers located at 1804 South Monroe Street was firebombed at 9 PM and 2 trailers were burned down. The police finished the process of cordoning off all of FAMU's campus in four different directions. At around that same time one of the city commissioners, John A. Rudd was injured by shattered glass when the car he was in with Mayor Gene Berkowitz was hit by bricks and bottles on Railroad Avenue close to Gamble Street. At 10 PM a group of blacks went into a different entrance to the university. The police were fired upon by rioters. As a result, police forces hid behind their patrol cars and the paddy wagon that was at the scene.[1]\n",

Elkins, a businessman who was identified as the prime suspect. Elkins committed suicide before he could be charged or thoroughly questioned.\nOn September 2, 1999, an old 55-gallon drum in the crawl space of a house in Jericho, Nassau County, New York, was found to contain the mummified remains of a pregnant Hispanic female in her late 20s between 145 and 152 cm (4'9\" and 5'0\") tall, with unusual dental work.[2] The cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head. The drum also contained polystyrene pellets, two rings (one inscribed \"M.H.R.\"), a locket inscribed \"To Patrice Love Uncle Phil\", green dye, a plastic artificial plant stem, and an address book.[2]\nThe drum had been made in 1963 for transporting dye. Markings showed it had been shipped to Melrose Plastics, an artificial flower manufacturing company partly owned by Howard B. Elkins, a local businessman who owned the Jericho house. This was until 1972, when he sold the company and moved to Boca Raton, Florida, with his wife.[2][3][4][5]\nUnder infrared light, some of the deteriorated address book was legible.[6] A Permanent Residence Card written on the first page belonged to Reyna Ang\u00e9lica Marroqu\u00edn, a 28-year-old immigrant from El Salvador who had worked as a nanny and for a manufacturer of artificial flowers at a factory on East 34th Street in Manhattan.[6][7] A phone number in the book belonged to Kathy Andrade, who had been a friend of Marroqu\u00edn. When contacted, Andrade told the police that Marroqu\u00edn had been having an extramarital affair with Elkins but had called Andrade to say she had become afraid of him after telling Elkins' wife about the affair.[8][5][6] Andrade went to Marroqu\u00edn's apartment but found it empty and Marroqu\u00edn was never heard from again.[4] There were reports that a woman fitting Marroqu\u00edn's description once appeared with a toddler at Melrose Plastics and employees had joked that the child's father was, in fact, Elkins.[5]\nDetectives who interviewed Elkins found him uncooperative, and told him they intended to obtain an order to take his DNA for comparison with that of the fetus found inside Marroqu\u00edn. The next day, September 10, 1999, Elkins was found dead in the back seat of a neighbor's car from a self-inflicted gunshot wound from a 12-gauge Mossberg 500 pump-action shotgun he purchased at a Walmart store that day found between his legs.[8][9][2][3][10][5]\nThe DNA testing found that Elkins was the father of the fetus.[9]\nInvestigators believe Elkins either went to Marroqu\u00edn's New Jersey apartment or lured her to the factory and killed her.[2] He then took her body to the Nassau County house, possibly with the intention of dumping her in the ocean from his boat, but after filling the barrel with plastic pellets to ensure it would sink, he found it too heavy to move and left it in the crawl space.[6][10]\nWriter Oscar Corral went to San Mart\u00edn, San Salvador, where Marroqu\u00edn's 95-year-old mother told him she had dreamt about Marroqu\u00edn trapped inside a barrel.[11][10] Marroqu\u00edn was buried in El Salvador; her mother died a month later and was buried with her.[6]\nThe peculiar circumstances of the crime inspired several media treatments of the Marroqu\u00edn case. The murder provided part of a 2004 episode called \"Broken Trust\" in the series The New Detectives.[2] The investigation into her murder was covered in \"Flower Drum Murder\", a 2015 episode of Murder Book, a true crime television series.[6] This case was used as the plot of an episode of NYPD Blue, \"Roll Out the Barrel\" (April 25, 2000).[12] The case was depicted in \"A Voice from Beyond\", a 2000 episode of the true crime series Forensic Files.[10] The murder was dramatized in the Investigation Discovery series Grave Secrets, Season 2, Episode 1 in an episode entitled, \"Beneath the Stairs\" first airing on November 14, 2017.[13] Yet another treatment of the case was an episode called \"Lady in a Barrel\" in Oxygen's series Buried in the Backyard, originally aired on June 17, 2018.[14] It was also partial inspiration for the 2020 short film \"Blood of Another.\"[15]  In episode 150, Georgia Hardstark covered the murder on the podcast, My Favorite Murder.\n",

He was employed as a commercial pilot with the airline Aerov\u00edas Q. He later acted as head of the Revolutionary Air Force, and during 1958 he smuggled weapons and ammunition from Costa Rica and Florida into Cuba by air.[1]\nAfter the Cuban Revolution on 1 January 1959, he was confirmed as head of the new Revolutionary Air Force as well as Castro's personal pilot. Within months, he became vocal about his opposition to the influence of communists on the new revolutionary government. On 29 June 1959, Fidel Castro relieved him of his post, and he left immediately by boat for Florida with his second wife and 3 of his six children, and reportedly with Frank Sturgis, a fellow anti-communist.[2]\nOn 14 July 1959, D\u00edaz was interviewed by the US Senate Internal Security subcommittee, where he gave out the first account of Fidel's planned move towards communism.[2]\nOn 21 October 1959 he carried out one of his most notorious acts, flying a twin-engined bomber (variously reported as a B-25 or B-26) over Havana while dropping anti-communist leaflets, along with his brother Marcos Diaz Lanz.

Lunsford was abducted from her home in the early morning of February 24, 2005, by John Couey, a 46-year-old convicted sex offender who lived nearby. Couey held her captive over the weekend, during which she was raped and later murdered by being buried alive. The media extensively covered the investigation and trial of Couey.\nJessica Lunsford's murder influenced the introduction of legislation in Florida known as Jessica's Law, designed to protect potential victims and reduce a sexual offender's ability to re-offend, which has since influenced similar legislation in 42 other states.\nOn August 24, 2007, a judge in Inverness convicted Couey for the kidnapping, sexual battery, and first degree murder of Lunsford, and sentenced him to death. However, Couey died of natural causes in 2009, before his sentence could be carried out.\nNine-year-old Jessica Lunsford disappeared in the night on February 24, 2005, from her home in Homosassa, Florida. After approximately three weeks of intense searching for her around the area of her home, John Evander Couey was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for an outstanding warrant of cannabis possession, but was released after questioning because it was only a local warrant.[1] Couey was a 46-year-old long-time resident of Homosassa with an extensive criminal record, listing dozens of arrests for burglary and was a convicted child sex offender. Due to the laws at the time, Couey received only short sentences and was not monitored after release, despite his record of being an experienced trespasser and his repeated sexual offenses against children.\nOn March 12, Couey was arrested in Augusta, Georgia, at the request of the Citrus County Sheriff's Office, for questioning about Jessica Lunsford's disappearance due to his residence on West Snowbird Court in Homosassa, only 65 yards from the Lunsford's home, and his criminal record. Couey stated he did not have anything to do with the nine-year-old's disappearance and had moved to Georgia to find a job, only knowing about it from the television news.[2] He was released from police custody after being interviewed.\nOn March 14, Couey's half-sister Dorothy Dixon gave permission to police to search her trailer at West Snowbird Court in Homosassa. Couey had lived at the West Snowbird Court residence with Dixon, her boyfriend Matt Dittrich, her daughter and son\u2013in-law, Madie and Gene Secord, and her two-year-old grandson, Joshua. During the search a blood-stained mattress and pillows were found in Couey's closet in his room, and forensic analysis discovered both Couey's and Lunsford's DNA on the mattress.[3]\nOn March 17, Couey was arrested and charged with the murder of Jessica Lunsford, and transported to the Citrus County jail in Florida.\nOn March 18, 2005, Couey made an audio-recorded and videotaped confession to having kidnapped, raped and murdered Lunsford.[4]\n",

He was murdered by his sister-in-law and her boyfriend in 2005.[1]\nDampier was born in Chicago's West Side.[2] His father was Jeffrey Dampier Sr.[3] His widow was Crystal Jackson Dampier.\nDampier and his ex-wife won the Illinois Lottery jackpot in 1996.[4] It was worth approximately US $20 million.[5] They eventually divorced and split the money 50/50. Soon after, Jeffrey met Crystal Jackson, dated and married her. Two years later, the two moved to Tampa Bay.[2]\nOnce in Florida, Dampier used the money to invest in a popcorn business called Kassie's Gourmet Popcorn, based in Tampa Bay's Channelside entertainment district.[6] Shortly after, he moved Crystal's two sisters, Victoria and Terri Jackson, to Tampa as well. With no means of their own, Dampier took care of both of the sisters' finances and continued to buy presents for many of their family members, including his sister-in-law Victoria Jackson (with whom he was having an affair).[5]\nOn July 26, 2005, Dampier was murdered by Victoria Jackson and her boyfriend Nathaniel Jackson, presumably for his jackpot winnings.[1][2]\nThere are multiple accounts of the murder. According to some sources, Dampier was lured to the Jacksons' apartment by Victoria Jackson, who claimed that she had car problems.[4] Dampier's hands and feet were bound with shoelaces.[5] Nathaniel Jackson then pointed a gun at Dampier and forced him into his van. Terri Jackson, Victoria's sister, was also at the scene of the murder.[3] Afterwards, Nathaniel gave the shotgun to Victoria and reportedly said, \"Shoot him or I'll shoot you.\"[5] Dampier was shot in the back of the head.[3]\nVictoria Jackson was tried and found guilty of first-degree murder, armed kidnapping and armed carjacking in 2006. She was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences. Nathaniel Jackson was prosecuted similarly.[3]\nJeffrey Dampier Sr. said that \"I think everything was correct. I think the state did a good job. I'm very happy. I think my family is happy.\" \nJeffrey Dampier\u2019s homicide has been featured on the Investigation Discovery series Blood Relatives, the Oxygen series Snapped: Killer Couples, and the TV One series Fatal Attraction.[citation needed]\n",

        "paragraph": "Franklin Delano Floyd (June 17, 1943 \u2013 January 23, 2023)[2] was an American murderer, rapist, and death row inmate. He was convicted of the 1989 murder of Cheryl Ann Commesso, as well as the kidnapping of 6-year-old Michael Anthony Hughes, who he claimed was his son, from his elementary school in Choctaw, Oklahoma. Floyd was also considered a person of interest in the 1990 hit-and-run death of his second wife (his kidnapping victim) Sharon Marshall, mother of Michael Anthony Hughes. It was later discovered that before becoming his wife, Sharon had been raised by Floyd from an early age as his daughter and was kidnapped by Floyd as a child.\nMarshall's true identity remained a mystery until 2014 when she was positively identified as Suzanne Marie Sevakis, the daughter of a woman to whom Floyd was briefly married. He disappeared with Sevakis, her two sisters, and infant brother Phillip (also known as \"Stevie\") while her mother was serving a 30-day jail sentence in 1975. Sevakis' brother remained missing until 2019 when a man came forward believing he was Phillip; DNA tests confirmed his identity in 2020.[3][4][5]\nFranklin Delano Floyd was born in Barnesville, Georgia, the youngest of five children born to Thomas and Della Floyd. Shortly after Floyd's first birthday in 1944, his father, a cotton mill worker and alcoholic, died from kidney and liver failure at 32. His mother, a widow at age 29, struggled to make a living independently, so she and her children lived in a small apartment with her parents.[6]\nOver the next year, caring for the large family became too difficult for Floyd's grandparents, and by 1946 they asked Della and her children to leave. Floyd and his siblings were put into the care of Georgia Baptist Children's Home in Hapeville at the advice of Lamar County Children Services. There, Floyd was allegedly bullied by other children for being \"feminine\" and later reported to have been sodomized with a broomstick when he was six years old. In his own words, he states that he was digitally penetrated in his anus by other boys in the home. He was also subjected to harsh punishments by the staff; as a teenager, his hand was dipped into hot water after being caught masturbating. Floyd often got in trouble for fighting and stealing. In 1959, having been there two years after his youngest sister left, Floyd ran away and broke into a nearby house to steal food. The Children's Home informed his sister Dorothy, now married and living in North Carolina with two children, that criminal charges would not be pursued if she took custody of her brother.[6]\nAfter being kicked out of his sister's home, Floyd traveled to Indianapolis to search for his mother, Della, only to learn that she had become a prostitute. Floyd had Della help him forge legal documents allowing him to go to California to enlist in the U.S. Army. However, the Army discharged Floyd six months into his service after discovering that he was underage and that his papers were falsified.[6] After being unable to find his mother again, Floyd traveled across the country as a drifter. Della died on July 2, 1968, and is buried in Graceland Cemetery in Chicago, Illinois.\nOn February 19, 1960, at age sixteen, Floyd broke into a Sears department store in Inglewood, California to steal a gun. Police quickly responded to a burglar alarm, resulting in a shootout in which Floyd was shot in the stomach. He survived following emergency surgery. After recovering, he was sent to a youth institution for a year. In 1961, he was arrested for violating his parole by going on a fishing trip in Canada with a friend.[6]\nIn May 1962, Floyd returned to Hapeville and found a job at Atlanta International Airport. The following month, he abducted a four-year-old from a local bowling alley and sexually assaulted her in the nearby woods. Floyd was convicted of kidnapping and child molestation and was sentenced to serve ten to twenty years at the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville. That November, he was moved to the Milledgeville State Hospital for psychiatric testing.[6]\nWhile being taken out for a medical errand in 1963, Floyd escaped and fled to Macon, where he robbed over $6,000 from a branch of the Citizens & Southern National Bank. He was convicted of the robbery and was sentenced to the Federal Reformatory in Chillicothe, Ohio. After a second escape attempt, he was transferred to the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.[6] There, he was continually raped by other inmates, causing him to climb a roof at the prison and threaten to commit suicide at one point. After being sent to the federal penitentiary in Marion, Illinois, Floyd was sent back to the Georgia State Prison in 1968 and befriended a fellow inmate named David Dial.[7]\nIn November 1972, Floyd was released from prison and sent to a halfway house. On January 27, 1973, a week after he was released from the halfway house, he approached a woman at a gas station and forced her into her car, where he attempted to grope and sexually assault her. The woman managed to escape, and Floyd was arrested. Floyd convinced Dial, who had also been released from prison, to post his bond, releasing him from custody until his hearing on June 11, 1973. Floyd did not show up to court, making him a fugitive.[7]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nNever Again MSD is an American student-led political action committee for gun control that advocates for tighter regulations to prevent gun violence.[1] The organization, also known by the Twitter hashtags #NeverAgain, and #EnoughIsEnough, was formed by a group of twenty students attending Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSD) at the time of the deadly shooting in 2018, in which seventeen students and staff members were killed by the alleged gunman, who was a 19-year-old former student of the school and was armed with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle. The organization started on social media as a movement \"for survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting\" using the hashtag #NeverAgain.[2] A main goal of the group was to influence that year's United States mid-term elections,[3] and they embarked on a multi-city bus tour to encourage young people to register to vote.[4]\nThe organization staged protests demanding legislative action to be taken to prevent similar shootings in the future and has vocally condemned U.S. lawmakers who have received political contributions from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[5][6][7][8] It was credited in The Washington Post as winning a \"stunning victory\" against the NRA in the Florida legislature in March 2018 when both houses voted for various gun control measures.[9] The law increased funding for school security and raised the required age to buy a gun from 18 to 21.[10]\nAmong the organization's most prominent members are Alfonso Calderon, Sarah Chadwick, Jaclyn Corin, Ryan Deitsch, X Gonz\u00e1lez, David Hogg, Cameron Kasky, and Alex Wind.[11][12][13] Corin, Gonz\u00e1lez, Hogg, Kasky, and Wind were featured on a cover of Time in March 2018.[14] In December later that year, it was announced that the March for Our Lives activists made the shortlist for Time's Person of the Year at number four.[15]\nThe group was co-formed by Cameron Kasky and his high school friends in the first four days after the shooting,[12] which was committed by a gunman who was a 19-year-old former student of the school and armed with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle.[16]\nThe initial three co-founders were Kasky, Alex Wind, and Sofie Whitney.[1][17] On February 15, 2018, one day after the shooting, Kasky met with Wind at a candlelight vigil.[17] Wind stated, \"The day after the shooting, we said something needs to happen; there needs to be a central space; there needs to be a movement.\"[17] After the vigil, Kasky invited Wind and Whitney to his house. Kasky came up with the name \"Never Again\" while the group stayed up through the night to make plans, and he posted \"Stay alert. #NeverAgain\" to Facebook.[12][18]\nOver the next three days after the shooting, the group gained over 35,000 followers on Facebook.[19] Kasky recruited other Stoneman Douglas students David Hogg, X Gonz\u00e1lez, and Delaney Tarr at a gun-control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where they spoke; other students quickly joined.[12][19] The students gave as many interviews as they could to television networks.[18] The group said they worked quickly to take advantage of the national media attention given to the shooting and its aftermath.[12] Numerous Stoneman Douglas students have been shown in media coverage.[1][18][20][21] By the next day, the group had created Twitter accounts and announced a March for Our Lives nationwide protest, for March 24, 2018.[22]\nStoneman Douglas teacher Ivy Schamis, who had been teaching her Holocaust History class about combating hate when the gunman fired shots into her classroom, stated she thought the Stoneman Douglas students' #NeverAgain hashtag was inspired by the class on Holocaust history.[23][24][25][26] In the classroom there had been a banner saying \"We Will Never Forget\", which a Holocaust survivor had given to Schamis.[23] Kelly Plaur, a student survivor from that class, is the great-granddaughter of an Auschwitz survivor.[25] Plaur protected Schamis during the shooting.[27] According to Schamis, the gunman was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he'd scrawled a swastika onto one of his ammunition magazines.[25] Schamis was presented with USC Shoah Foundation\u2019s inaugural Stronger Than Hate Educator Award in 2019. During her acceptance speech at the award ceremony, Schamis honored the two students Nicholas Dworet and Helena Ramsay from her class that were killed during the shooting. Schamis added, \"We share our stories in the hope that others understand that hate is not OK, it's never OK.\"[26]\nThe Fort Lauderdale gun control rally at Broward County Federal Courthouse on February 17, 2018 was attended by hundreds of supporters.[28] Elected officials and gun control advocates, including Florida Senator Gary Farmer, called for an increase in firearm restrictions and gun control legislation.[29] At this rally, X Gonz\u00e1lez began their speech with a moment of silence for the 17 victims killed in the school shooting.[30] They then gave an impassioned 11-minute speech, in which they demanded to know where the \"common sense\" was in America's gun laws, calling out members of Congress who have accepted contributions from the NRA.[30][31][32] Gonz\u00e1lez was noted for rebuking \"thoughts and prayers\" from the government and President Donald Trump.[31]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn February 2, 2021, a shootout occurred between a gunman and several agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at an apartment complex in Sunrise, Florida, United States. At the time, the agents were serving a warrant related to a child pornography case. Two FBI agents were fatally shot and three others were injured. The gunman, who was the subject of the warrant, was later found dead after barricading himself inside the apartment. The incident was one of the deadliest in the FBI's history.\nAt 6:04\u00a0a.m., FBI agents investigating a child exploitation case served a federal warrant at the Water Terrace apartment complex, located in an upscale gated community in Sunrise, 11 miles (18\u00a0km) outside of Fort Lauderdale. They were seeking a computer and other evidence for the case. The agents were being backed up by officers with the Sunrise Police Department. As the agents were about to execute the warrant, the subject of their warrant, who had reportedly seen them coming through a doorbell camera, began firing at them with a rifle. Five agents were struck, two of them fatally, prompting a massive law enforcement response, including the SWAT team from the Broward County Sheriff's Office. One of the fatally wounded agents, Daniel Alfin, managed to return fire, despite being shot multiple times. The other deceased agent, Laura Schwartzenberger, was killed instantly.[3] The gunman, who was wounded in the exchange, then barricaded himself inside the home for several hours and was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.[1][4][5][6][7][8] Witnesses calling 9-1-1 reported hearing multiple gunshots in the apartment complex.[9]\nThe shootout was the most violent incident in the FBI's history since the 1986 Miami shootout that left two agents dead and five others injured, and it was also the first time an agent was fatally shot in the line of duty since 2008.[4][5][10]\nTwo FBI agents were killed in the shootout and three others were injured. Those killed were Special Agent Daniel Alfin, 36, and Special Agent Laura Schwartzenberger, 43. Schwartzenberger had been with the FBI since 2005, and Alfin since 2009. Both of them specialized in crimes against children. Two of the injured agents, both of whom suffered multiple gunshot wounds, were in stable condition at a hospital and eventually released, while the third did not require hospitalization and was treated at the scene.[4][5][11][12]\nThe gunman, 55-year-old David Lee Huber, was also identified as the subject in the federal warrant.[2][13][14] The FBI and investigators said he was being investigated for possession of child pornography.[15] A Sunrise Police spokeswoman said the department hadn't had any prior dealings with Huber, nor were they aware of any prior concern that he was armed.[5] The department later said they had been called to his apartment three times in April 2020, twice in one day because of noise and nuisance complaints, and the third time for a \"medical run\".[14] His only interactions with law enforcement were through a series of traffic tickets and an eviction in Colorado.[15]\nHuber was born and raised in Louisiana and lived in South Florida for most of his life. He had previously lived in New York, Colorado, and Atlanta for portions of his life. He married in late 2000 and had two children, but he divorced in 2016.[15] Huber attended an unspecified college in Broward County, according to an online resume he wrote. He ran a computer troubleshooting company with his then-wife from 2004 to around 2006, then a computer consultation company from 2006 to 2011. From 2013 to 2020, he worked a series of computer-related jobs.[2] He was also a former mortgage broker.[14] A neighbor described Huber as an awkward, antisocial man who lived alone and with little furniture. He had been living in Pembroke Pines before the shooting.[15]\nA former coworker said Huber told him that he was suffering from bipolar disorder that he was taking medication for. The coworker also said Huber had been fired from his job as a systems analyst after ranting against President Donald Trump taking away his medical coverage during a company discussion on healthcare. Following the incident, employees were concerned about Huber returning and committing a workplace shooting in retaliation, which led to the company organizing escorts and allowing some employees to bring their firearms into the office.[16]\nPresident Joe Biden reacted to the shootout, saying his \"heart aches\" for the deceased agents.[17] FBI Director Christopher A. Wray praised the two deceased agents in a statement and also said the FBI \"will be forever grateful for their bravery.\" The FBI Agents Association offered condolences to the injured and said the two agents' deaths were \"devastating to the entire FBI community and to our country.\"[4][5]\n",

An organized protest in the form of a national school walkout occurred on March 14. March for Our Lives was held on March 24. Another major demonstration occurred April 20, 2018.\nThe anti-gun violence group Never Again MSD, formed and led by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting,[1] held a rally on February 17 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which was attended by hundreds of students.[2]\nThe Fort Lauderdale rally was followed by other protests across the country. On February 19, a group of teenagers staged a \"lie-in\" outside the White House.[3] Hundreds of students marched to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 20.[4] Students also demonstrated at Florida's Capitol.[5] In Kansas, several hundred high school students protested on February 21.[6]\nThe students from Parkland, Florida began encouraging companies who partner with the NRA \u2014 offering perks or discounts to members \u2014 to sever ties with the organization. Over a dozen[7] companies dropped their NRA partnership in the days following.[8]\nThe Enough! National School Walkout[11] was a walkout planned by organizers of the Students' March, that occurred on March 14, in response to the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. The protest had students, parents, and gun control students leaving schools for seventeen minutes (one minute for each person who died during the shooting) starting at 10:00\u00a0a.m. in their respective time zone.[12][13] The protest was held exactly one month after the Stoneman Douglas shooting.[14][15] The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) supported the student's activism.[16]\nAn estimated 3,000 schools and nearly 1 million students participated in the protest.[17][18][19][20] Thousands of students gathered in Washington, D.C. and observed 17 minutes of silence with their backs turned to the White House.[21]\nAt Greenbrier High School in Greenbrier, Arkansas three students elected to receive corporal punishment in the form of two paddlings on the thighs for their participation in the walkout. This required parental consent, and was administered the same day.[22]\n[23]\nNearly 200 U.S. colleges added their names to #NeverAgain Colleges,[24] including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University, and the University of Florida.[25] The colleges would not penalize high school students who face disciplinary action as a result of participating in a peaceful Never Again MSD protest.[25]\n",

A woman named \"Alice\" answered the ad.[3] The woman was actually Parent. Soon after, McGowan disappeared; on July 19, 1990, her remains were found in a rural canal in St. Lucie County, Florida. She had been mutilated by removing a tattoo on her stomach, her head had been decapitated and her hands severed to hinder the identification,[3] however the killer had overlooked another small tattoo, which this, along with a couple teeth that were left from the decapitation, were enough to positively identify her.[2]\nAccording to investigators, Parent was known to have traveled around the world on more than 20 different identities and was a master of disguise, even at times posing as a man.\nThe origin of Parent's nickname, the \"Chameleon Killer,\" was a photograph of an oil painting of herself she sent to police with the message \"Best wishes: your Chameleon\" typed on the back. The nickname was apt, as she stole the identities of her victims[4] and was found to have used McGowan's credit cards after she killed her.[2] She also scoured graveyards for names and dates of birth and stole the information of other potential roommates by telling them she was a numerologist, soliciting their Social Security numbers, driver's licences and even birth certificates.[3][2]\nWhen Florida police caught up with her in Panama City, Florida, on April 6, 2002, she committed suicide by shooting herself in the heart as they stood outside her bedroom door waiting for her to get dressed.[4]\nThere have been concerns that in her time on the run she is likely to have committed other crimes.[4][2] Some investigators have even questioned if \"Elaine Parent\" was her actual, given name, since no birth certificate for her has ever been found.[2]\nBeverly McGowan's murder and the search for Elaine Parent were profiled on Unsolved Mysteries and America's Most Wanted.[1] In 2003, BBC did a special documentary on Parent's criminal career titled \"The World's Most Wanted Woman\". In 2014, she was featured on the Investigation Discovery program Swamp Murders.[5]\n\nThis biographical article related to crime is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",

National School Walkout was held on the one month anniversary of the Stoneman Douglas shooting.[29][30] It involved students walking out from their classes for exactly 17 minutes (one for each of the victims of the massacre)[31] and involved more than 3,000 schools across the United States[32][33] and nearly one million students.[34] Thousands of students also gathered and staged a rally in Washington, D.C., after observing 17 minutes of silence with their backs to the White House.[30][35] After the success of the walkout, Hogg posted a tweet[36] that included a provocative, NRA-style advertisement calling out lawmakers for their inaction on or opposition to gun control efforts, asking \"What if our politicians weren't the bitch of the NRA?\", and ending with a promotion for the upcoming March.[37]\nGeorge Clooney and Scooter Braun were major forces behind the organization of the march, and aided in fundraising efforts behind the scenes.[38] Amal and George Clooney donated $500,000 to support the march and announced they would attend. Oprah Winfrey matched the Clooney donation to support the march.[39][40] Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife Marilyn also contributed $500,000.[41] Film director and producer Steven Spielberg and actress Kate Capshaw Spielberg donated $500,000, also matching the donation of the Clooneys.[42] On February 23, Gucci announced they were also donating $500,000 towards the march.[43] Other people and organizations offering support have included Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber,[44] Gabby Giffords, Lauren Jauregui, Alyssa Milano, Moms Demand Action, Amy Schumer, St. Vincent, Harry Styles,[45] Hayley Williams,[46][47] Paul McCartney,[48] Kanye West, and Kim Kardashian.[49] John Legend and Chrissy Teigen donated $25,000.[50] Jimmy Fallon pledged to attend an event with his family.[51] Samantha Bee interviewed kids.[52] Jim Jefferies interviewed participants in San Diego.[53] Other celebrities including Taylor Swift have donated an undisclosed amount of money toward the campaign.[54] Justin Timberlake, Will Smith, Cher and Amy Poehler also participated in the march.[55]\nJames Corden promoted the March for Our Lives event.[56] John Zimmer and Logan Green, the co-founders of Lyft, announced their support of the rallies and stated that their company would provide free rides for those attending demonstrations.[57] Dating app Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd subsequently announced that they were supporting the NeverAgain movement by banning all images of firearms on their dating application.[58]\n",

He was executed in 1979, the first convicted criminal to be executed in Florida after capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, and the second (after Gary Gilmore) in the United States.\nSpenkelink escaped from a California prison in 1972, where he was serving a five-years-to-life sentence for armed robbery of a fast-food restaurant, five gas stations and two people.[1]  On February 4, 1973, the 24-year-old Spenkelink picked up hitchhiker Joseph J. Szymankiewicz and checked into a hotel in Tallahassee, Florida. The two had been on an apparent robbery spree.[2] The two got into a heated argument, Spenkelink left the hotel room and upon his return shot Szymankiewicz in the back and beat him with a hatchet.[2][3][4]\nLess than a week later, Spenkelink was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery in Buena Park, California and the murder weapon was found in an apartment of one of Spenkelink's associates.\nSpenkelink claimed he had acted in self-defense\u2014that Szymankiewicz had stolen his money, forced him to play Russian roulette, and sexually assaulted him.[4]\nAfter he was charged, Spenkelink turned down a plea bargain to second-degree murder that would have resulted in a life sentence. In 1973 he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Frank Brumm was also tried as a co-defendant for the murder but was acquitted.[3] After Brumm's acquittal he said Spenkelink had offered him $1,000 to \u201cget rid of\u201d a friend, and that he and Spenkelink both shot Syzmankiewicz and beat him with the hatchet. After Szymankiewicz was dead, Brumm said he and Spenkelink finished a bottle of gin over the body.[5]\nIn a 1972 court case, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down death penalty schemes in all states, ruling that it had been applied unfairly. Florida and other states rushed to rewrite less-arbitrary laws.[6]\nSpenkelink appealed his sentence, but in 1977, Governor Reubin Askew of Florida signed Spenkelink's first death warrant.[7] In 1979 Askew's successor, Governor Bob Graham, signed a second death warrant. Spenkelink continued to appeal, earning stays from both the U.S Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, but both stays were overturned,[8] meaning that Spenkelink would be the first man put to death involuntarily (Gilmore had insisted he wanted to die)[9] since executions were resumed in the U.S. in 1976.\nSpenkelink's case became a national cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre, encompassing both the broader debate over the morality of the death penalty and the narrower question of whether capital punishment fit Spenkelink's crime.  His cause was taken up by former Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, actor Alan Alda, and singer Joan Baez, among many others.[10]  Also at issue was whether capital punishment discriminated against the poor and underprivileged\u2014Spenkelink often signed his prison correspondence with the epigram, \"capital punishment means those without capital get the punishment.\"[11]\nThe execution was finally carried out on May 25, 1979, in \"Old Sparky\", the Florida State Prison electric chair.[12][13]  That morning, Doug Tracht, a popular Jacksonville disc jockey, aired a recording of sizzling bacon on his radio program and dedicated it to Spenkelink.[14][15]\n",

Carlopoli (born June 7, 1988) and Tammy Jo Modlin (March 28, 1972 \u2013 January 24, 2016) are an American couple who entered into a murder-suicide pact in Fort Myers, Florida. In 2016, Patrick and Tammy conspired to kill Tammy's children, one of whom was Patrick's daughter, then each other. However, following the murders, and after Tammy was voluntarily killed by Patrick, he found himself unable to follow through. Carlopoli instead called the police and was arrested. He later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to forty years in prison.\nCarlopoli was from Las Vegas while Tammy, who was born Tammy Jo Lewis, was from Indianapolis. Tammy married a man named Mark Modlin, and they had a daughter together in 1999, who they named Montana. The two got divorced in the early 2000s.[1]\nTammy graduated from Castle High School in 1990, and the University of Southern Indiana in 1996, with a degree in political science.[2]\nCarlopoli moved to Florida after having a falling-out with his family. He met Tammy, who was on disability checks while staying in a hotel at Orlando in 2010, and the two started dating. Carlopoli, who was attending college, started personally tutoring Montana Modlin in math.[3] The couple moved to Fort Myers after Carlopoli got a school transfer. Carlopoli got a job as a waiter at an Outback Steakhouse restaurant to help pay for tuition. He had hoped to become a mechanical engineer.[4]\nNeither Carlopoli nor Tammy had histories of violence. Carlopoli had no criminal record and Tammy only had a 2015 citation for failing to pay a toll.[4]\nIn 2012, Carlopoli and Tammy had a daughter together, who they named Jeanne Carlopoli.[5] The couple could sometimes be heard fighting, occasionally loudly and viciously. Two neighbors said they heard the Carlopoli and Modlin yelling at cursing at each other regularly. Although they sometimes saw the family on several occasions, including once at a cookout, they noted that even then, they didn't seem happy. The family had also lived in relative isolation.[6][7]\nOne neighbor told reporters that they regretted not saying anything sooner. They said they often saw Jeanne staring out the window. \"She looked like there was something wrong,\" she said. \"She was always in the same pajamas, her hair was never combed. Looked dirty.\" She went on to say that she and other neighbors talked about calling someone to check on the family, but never did. Maybe if we had, she would still be alive,\" said the neighbor.[8]\nAccording to Carlopoli, Tammy experienced paranoid delusions prior to the murders. Six days beforehand, Carlopoli was fired, and his friends reported he began acting different.[9] Two days beforehand, Tammy posted a message on Facebook saying \"I have suffered from depression my whole life. I have taken a Sam's bottle of Tylenol. Please wait for notification. I will refuse a hospital. It is my time. I love you. It is for the best. I want peace.\"[10]\nCarlopoli and Tammy conspired to kill the children, their dog, and themselves. On January 24, 2016, Carlopoli and Tammy fatally stabbed Milo, the family's Chihuahua-Jack Russell. Tammy then stabbed Jeanne, 3, and shot Montana, 16. She was then voluntarily shot and killed by Carlopoli. However, when Carlopoli was unable to muster the willpower to kill himself. He instead dropped the gun, went outside, and called the police.[6]\n",

While returning home from her job at a Volusia County library, she had become embroiled in a road rage incident with a local motorcyclist, during which she had intentionally struck his vehicle with hers, an act witnessed by two nearby motorists. The three notified police and followed her to the house, where she confronted them with her fianc\u00e9's pistol. The motorcyclist drew his own gun and shot her five times.[3]\nMorales, who was reported by her mother to be five months pregnant, was pronounced dead following arrival at a nearby hospital. The shooter, who had a  concealed carry permit, was taken into police custody and released pending the investigation. Authorities were unable to confirm her pregnancy during the autopsy.[4] Four months later the local prosecutor's office announced it had found the shooting justified as self-defense and would not be filing charges.\nMorales had worked as a server in area restaurants until she got a job as an assistant librarian with the county in 2019, which she described as one of her dream jobs. At the time of her death she was engaged and reported by her mother to be pregnant; she had an 11-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.[3]\nAround 5:10\u00a0p.m. on November 20, 2021, Morales was driving her blue Kia back from the DeLand Regional Library south on Volusia Avenue (U.S. routes 17 and 92) to her Orange City home.[3] At one intersection another Orange City resident, a 40-year-old man who had gone out for a ride on his motorcycle, came up behind her when she stopped at a red light. Afterwards, he told police later, she attempted to cut him off.[3]\nThe motorcyclist said he drove past her driver's side window and waved his hand to express his astonishment, then decided to hasten back to his home. As he sped away, Morales in turn overtook him, then swerved abruptly into his lane, striking his vehicle in the process. The collision caused visible damage to the saddlebags on the back of his motorcycle and nearly caused him to crash, but he was able to keep his cycle upright and was not injured. One witness claimed that as Morales drove away he saw the motorcyclist kick her car, though that was never confirmed by police.[3]\nTwo other motorists, one also on a motorcycle,[3] witnessed the collision. They likewise believed it had been intentional. They joined the first motorcyclist in confronting Morales the next time traffic stopped, at the light at Wisconsin Avenue in Orange City,[5] and asking that she stop to exchange information and await the police, whom one had already notified. Instead, she turned towards her residence on East Wisconsin.[3]\nOrange City police were dispatched to the scene in response to the hit-and-run reported to them. Morales's mother, Doreen Flaherty, says her daughter had called from her car to complain that she was being followed by three men and to have her gun ready when Morales got home. Upon reaching Flaherty's house, Morales left the car, swearing loudly, and entered, where she called 9-1-1 to report the men following her, who arrived soon afterwards and remained in the street, at the foot of Flaherty's driveway, to await the police. Flaherty also took out her own gun, which she says was unloaded, and stepped outside the front door.[3]\nBefore police arrived, Morales got her fianc\u00e9's handgun\u2014which her mother says did not have a bullet chambered as Morales was not strong enough to pull back the slide\u2014and went out to confront the men outside. She waved her hands and shouted \"You're three men. You followed me. Leave me alone!\" as she waved the gun around and pointed it at the man whose motorcycle she had hit.[6] One of the accident witnesses recalled that he raised his hands and began shouting at everyone to calm down.[3] Fearing Morales was about to shoot at him, the first motorcyclist drew the .45-caliber pistol he had a permit to carry concealed and fired eight[6] times from 15 feet (5\u00a0m) away.[3]\n",

He was known for confessing to killing victims at parks and rest areas across more than twenty U.S. states.\nBorn in Michigan, Evans was convicted of his first crime in Galveston, Texas, for the rape of a local woman in 1986.[1] He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison, but served only five. After his parole in 1991, he returned to Galveston and took work as a desk clerk in a motel, but was discharged after parole officials \"objected to a convicted sex offender working in a motel setting.\"[1]\nEvans was arrested while he was employed aboard a fishing boat, for the murder of the 10-year-old girl that he had raped and kidnapped. He eventually faced a new arrest warrant when a former girlfriend filed a complaint to police about threats of violence.[1] Evans stayed ahead of law enforcement officials briefly by stealing a car and fleeing to Mississippi.[1] He tried to remain inconspicuous in the Gulfport area, but soon committed the crime for which he would receive the death penalty: the rape and murder of 10-year-old Beatrice Louise Routh on August 1, 1991.[1][2]\nEvans seized the homeless girl from a Gulfport park and sexually assaulted her, before strangling her to death and dumping her corpse in a rural area. At trial, the medical examiner testified that the girl \"was conscious, and could feel pain\" throughout her day-long ordeal.[1] Arrested soon afterward, Evans confessed to abducting the girl, and he was remanded to a federal prison in Colorado on kidnapping charges.[2] On August 16, 1993, a jury trial in Mississippi convicted Evans of sexual battery and murder; three days later, the same jury refused an option to grant him life imprisonment and sentenced him to the death penalty.[1]\nWhile in custody, Evans also claimed responsibility for killing more than 70 other people in 22 states.  Most of the murders and rapes took place at rest stops and public parks. The authorities were originally skeptical of Evans's claims, but two of his descriptions were perfect matches to unsolved cases across Florida. In 1995, Evans pleaded guilty to the 1985 strangulation death of Ira Jean Smith in exchange for a life sentence.[3][4]\nHe successfully escaped the Harrison County Jail in June 1993 but was recaptured a short time later, hiding in a shed. Evans was stabbed to death in 1999 by a fellow death row inmate at the Mississippi State Penitentiary while in the shower.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn February 14, 2018, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Miami suburban town of Parkland, Florida, murdering 17 people[note 2] and injuring 17 others.[2][3][4] Cruz, a former student at the school, fled the scene on foot by blending in with other students, and was arrested without incident approximately one hour later in nearby Coral Springs.[5] Police and prosecutors investigated \"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\".[6]\nThe killing spree is the deadliest high school shooting in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre that killed 15, including the perpetrators, in Colorado in April 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

        "paragraph": "The 1986 FBI Miami shootout occurred on April 11, 1986, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, U.S. (the specific area was incorporated as Pinecrest in 1996), when a small group of field agents for the FBI attempted to apprehend William Russell Matix and Michael Lee Platt, who were suspected of committing a series of violent crimes in and around the Miami metropolitan area.\nAlthough they had partially surrounded the suspects after maneuvering them off a local road, the agents involved quickly found their firepower was outmatched by the weapons which Matix and Platt had in their vehicle. During the gun battle which ensued, Platt in particular was able to repeatedly return fire despite sustaining multiple hits. Two Special Agents died from their wounds, while five other agents were injured by gunfire. The shootout ended when both Matix and Platt were killed.\nThe incident is infamous as one of the most violent episodes in the history of the FBI and is often studied in law enforcement training. The scale of the shootout led to the introduction of more effective handguns, primarily switching from revolvers to semi-automatics, in the FBI and many police departments around the United States.\nMichael Lee Platt (February 3, 1954 \u2013 April 11, 1986) and William Russell Matix (June 25, 1951 \u2013 April 11, 1986) met while serving in the U.S. Army at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\nMatix first served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1969 to 1972, working as a cook (MOS 3371) in the officers' mess, serving in Hawaii and Okinawa from April 1970 to March 1971 and April 1971 to March 1972 respectively. He was honorably discharged July 7, 1972, achieving the rank of Sergeant. He enlisted in the U.S. Army on August 10, 1973, serving with the military police under the 101st Airborne Division in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He served as a Military Police Officer and Squad Leader; Guard Supervisor for the Post Stockade and finally Patrol Supervisor before his honorable discharge August 9, 1976.[1]\nPlatt enlisted in the Army 27 June 1972 as an infantryman. While in basic training, Platt applied for Army Airborne Ranger Training and subsequently entered Air Assault School at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. On completion of air assault school, Platt was assigned to the Military Police Unit. It was in this unit that he met and served with Matix. This is also where he met his first wife, Regina Lylen. He was honorably discharged in 1979.[1]\nBoth men's former wives had died under violent circumstances.[2] Matix's wife, Patricia Mary (n\u00e9e  Buchanich) Matix, and a female co-worker, Joyce McFadden, both cancer researchers, were found stabbed to death on December 30, 1983, at Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where both women worked.[3] Both were found murdered in the hospital laboratory. They had been bound and gagged with their throats slashed.[1] Matix reportedly told investigators he suspected Platt had carried on an affair with his wife. Matix was a suspect in the murders but was never charged.[4]\nAfter his wife's death, Matix moved to Florida at Platt's urging, and the two founded Yankee Clipper Tree Trimming Service, a landscaping and tree removal business.[5] In May 1985, Matix married Christy Lou Horne, who moved out of the house two months later when Matix became enraged after learning she was pregnant. She would give birth to their son after Matix's death.[6][7]\nOn December 21, 1984, Platt's wife, Regina, whom he had married nine years earlier in 1975, was found dead from a single shotgun blast to the mouth. Her death was ruled a suicide.[8] He married his second wife, Brenda Horne, in January 1985.[citation needed]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nMurder in Florida constitutes the intentional killing, under circumstances defined by law, of people within or under the jurisdiction of the U.S. state of Florida.\nIn Florida, a person is guilty of first-degree murder when it is perpetrated from a premeditated design to result in the death of a human being. A person is also guilty of first-degree murder if they cause the death of any individual during the commission of a predicate felony regardless of actual intent or premeditation. This is called felony murder. This offense is categorized as capital offense, so if convicted, the offender could possibly receive the death penalty.[1][2]\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in the year 2020, the state had a murder rate slightly above the median for the entire country.[3]\nIn the state of Florida, the common law felony murder rule has been codified in Florida Statutes \u00a7 782.04.[4]\nThe predicate felonies that will support a charge of first degree murder under the statute are:[5][6]\nThe statute also punishes as second degree murder the killing of another human being during the commission of a felony that is imminently dangerous to human life.  Also, if the defendant was involved in the commission of a predicate felony, but the homicide was perpetrated by another co-felon, the defendant can be charged with second degree murder.[7]\nFlorida also recognizes the offense of attempted felony murder, codified in F.S. \u00a7 782.051.  The offense punishes those that act in a way that can kill another person during the commission of one of the predicate felonies.[4]\nSource:[8]\nIf a person committing a predicate felony directly contributed to the death of the victim then the person will be charged with murder in the first degree - felony murder which is a capital felony. The only two sentences available for that statute are life in prison and the death penalty.[9][10] If the defendant was under 18, a judge sets a maximum term of 40 years and they are eligible for a review of their sentence after 25 years.\n",

His appearance on the national television show America's Most Wanted led to his capture and conviction for the killings of an 8-year-old girl and her grandmother in September 1993.\nJames was born in Bristol, Pennsylvania.[2] He believed his last name was Matlack until the age of 10 when he discovered that the man raising him was his stepfather. At 11, James met and went to live with his biological father, who introduced him to drugs. Ironically, his father was a drug counselor.[3] In his mid-teens, James returned to live with his mother in Casselberry, Florida. His life now revolved around fighting and drugs, and he claimed to have blackouts. His mother sought assistance from a mental health counselor; however, his violence and anger continued.[4]\nJames dropped out of high school in his junior year and joined the U.S. Army when he was 17. He was stationed in Germany but was soon discharged for \"failure to conform.\"[5] James returned to Casselberry, where he became friends with a man named Tim Dick. James was welcomed into Dick's extended family, and, in the summer of 1993, he rented a room from Dick's mother, Betty.[6][7]\nOn September 20, 1993, James returned home from a party to find Betty Dick's four grandchildren sleeping in the living room.[8] He grabbed 8-year-old Toni Neuner by the neck and strangled her, then took her to his bedroom and raped her, after which he put her body between his bed and the wall.[9][10]\nJames proceeded to Dick's bedroom, where he hit her in the head with a candlestick and repeatedly stabbed her with a knife. Dick screamed, waking up Toni's sister, 9-year-old Wendi, who came to the bedroom.[11] James tied Wendi up and put her in the bathroom.[12] He got a butcher knife from the kitchen and returned to Dick's bedroom, sticking the knife in her back. After showering and taking jewelry from Dick's bedroom, James fled in her car.[10]\nOn September 28, 1993, America's Most Wanted (AMW) broadcast information related to the case, resulting in hundreds of viewer phone calls. Several tips indicated that he was traveling west. On October 5, 1993, AMW rebroadcast the details of the case, including this updated information. The next day, a viewer spotted James at the California state unemployment office in Bakersfield and contacted authorities.[9] Once in police custody, he gave two taped statements.[13]\nOn April 5, 1995, James pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder, and one count each of aggravated child abuse, attempted sexual battery, kidnapping, grand theft and grand theft auto. He also pleaded no contest to two counts of capital sexual battery charged by separate information.[14]\nOn August 18, 1995, James was sentenced to death for the murders of Toni Neuner and Betty Dick, as well sentences ranging from 15 years to life on the other charges.[15] He is incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution in Raiford, Florida.\n",

He was the first journalist killed in the 2001 anthrax attacks when letters containing anthrax were mailed to multiple media outlets in the United States. The anthrax attacks also killed four others in the United States and sickened seventeen others.[1]\nRobert Stevens was born in Britain,[2] but he resided in Lantana, Florida, with his wife Maureen Stevens, also from Britain.[1][3][4] Stevens and his wife had three children, Nicholas Stevens, Heidi Hogan, and Casey Tozzi.[3][5] Many people described Stevens as a person who loved to spend time outdoors.[4]\nRobert Stevens was a newspaper photo editor for Sun, owned by American Media, until he was hospitalized on October 2, 2001.[3][6] American Media published many different tabloids including the National Enquirer and the Sun.[7][8] Many of the publications that Stevens worked on made claims that Elvis was not dead or that celebrities were pregnant with martians.[9]\nIn early October 2001, letters which contained anthrax were mailed to multiple locations across the United States.  After a recent visit to North Carolina, Robert Stevens reported having symptoms similar to the flu.[4]  When he was first hospitalized, doctors believed he had developed meningitis. After the doctors completed further testing, it was discovered that he had developed pulmonary anthrax.[4] This had also already been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[9] Stevens died on October 5, 2001, making his death the first death from anthrax in 25 years.[10] After an investigation was conducted by the FBI, it was revealed that Stevens had come into contact with anthrax through the letter that was mailed to him at American Media in Boca Raton, Florida.[5]\nStevens was the first person killed in these attacks.[3] In addition to killing Stevens, the anthrax killed two postal workers in Washington, a hospital worker in New York, and a 94-year-old woman from Connecticut, and it caused seventeen other people to become sick.[11] In addition, an envelope containing anthrax was opened in what was once the office of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle. As a result, the House of Representatives was closed down.[9]\nDuring their investigation, the FBI concluded that Bruce Edwards Ivins, a microbiologist for the United States Army, had mailed the deadly letters.[7] The FBI obtained some of the anthrax spores and analyzed them. After analyzing the spores, the FBI traced the spores to a military lab located at Fort Detrick, Maryland.[1] Ivins quickly became a suspect in the investigation. The FBI began to suspect Ivins when they noticed he had logged in many late-night hours right before the attacks.[12] He was questioned in March 2005 about the attacks, but he could not provide a valid reason why he had worked late those nights. In addition to this, Ivins had sent out several emails in which he discussed his mental state and treatment.[1] In 2008 Ivins killed himself just as the FBI was preparing to arrest him.[8][11] Leading up to his death, Ivins had been hospitalized for psychiatric evaluation after threatening to kill people he worked with, investigators of the anthrax attacks, and many other people who had supposedly wronged him.[11]\nMaureen Stevens, wife of Robert Stevens, filed a US $50 million lawsuit in 2003 against the government of the United States.[13] In the lawsuit, Maureen Stevens claimed \"that the government was negligent in failing to stop someone from working at an Army infectious disease lab from creating weapons-grade anthrax used in letters that killed five people and sickened 17 others.\"[13] Ten years after filing the lawsuit, Maureen Stevens settled with the United States government for US$2.5 million. After Maureen and her lawyer settled with the government, Maureen's lawyer said, \"Justice has been served.\"[14][15]\nThe anthrax mailings that killed five people and sickened seventeen others came right after the September 11 terrorist attacks.  Because they came immediately following 9/11, investigators believed that Al Qaeda was also somehow responsible for the anthrax attacks \u2014 only this time, they were using biological weapons.[1][5]  However, it was soon discovered that the strain of anthrax used was connected to a military research laboratory in Maryland.[1]\nRobert Stevens was the first anthrax victim to be killed in 25 years.[10] The type of anthrax with which he was killed was rare and lethal.  During the investigation, the FBI shut down the offices in which Stevens was employed to collect evidence of anthrax.[16]  Another thing that makes the death of Robert Stevens important is that at the time it was very rare for anthrax to be in the form of white powder.[16]  At the time experts believed that Anthrax could be found in the soil, in sheep, in cattle, and in horses.[4][6]  The machines used to process mail as it came through the system caused anthrax spores to go into the air.  Then, by cleaning those same machines, the anthrax spores spread even farther and onto other mail causing twenty two other people to become sick; five of whom died.[6]\n",

In the 1980s, he joined the Nation of Yahweh, and by Halloween 1986 had killed at least four people on behalf of the religious group.  Charged therefor, Rozier turned state's evidence against the group and its leader, and was sentenced to 22 years in prison; he was paroled after ten and put into witness protection.  After Rozier was caught bouncing checks in 1999, he was sentenced to 25 years-to-life under California's three-strikes law in 2001.\nBorn on July 28, 1955 in Anchorage, Alaska Territory, Robert Earnest Rozier Jr.[1] was a United States Air Force brat who grew up in California.[2]\nAt Cordova High School in Rancho Cordova, California, he scored a 1.32 grade point average and did not receive his high school diploma.  Rozier was later a student at both Grays Harbor College in Aberdeen, Washington and the University of California, Berkeley (majoring in African-American studies), but graduated from neither school.[2]\nBy 1999, Rozier was living in Cameron Park, California, owned an auto detailing business in Sacramento, worked in web design, and had raised two children.[3]\nAt Cordova High, Rozier was an athletic wunderkind: the teen played American football as a defensive end and was \"all-league, all-conference, all-Northern California.\"  The high-schooler could also high jump 6\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches (2.01\u00a0m), vertical jump ten feet (3.0\u00a0m), sprint the 40-yard dash in 4.7 seconds, and bench press 375 pounds (170\u00a0kg).  When he was passed over to play college football for lacking his Cordova High diploma, he enrolled at Grays Harbor College where he was eventually recruited by University of California, Berkeley's football coach, Mike White.  At California, team captain Ralph DeLoach described Rozier as \"the best athlete on the team\".[2]\nThe 6-foot-3-inch (1.91\u00a0m) and 240-pound (110\u00a0kg) Bob Rozier was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the ninth round of the 1979 NFL Draft (228th overall).  A defensive end, Rozier played as number 75 for six games in 1979, starting for none of them.[1]  Rozier's professional sports career in the states was derailed by \"allegations of drug use and petty crime.\"[3]  Rozier briefly moved on to the Canadian Football League, playing for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and the Saskatchewan Roughriders, and finally signed with the Oakland Raiders (\"a team with a reputation for collecting misfits\") for only two weeks.[2]\nWhile playing professional football in Canada, Rozier allegedly wrote bad checks for US$20,000\u201330,000 (equivalent to about $49,000\u201374,000 in 2021).  By November 1986, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had 32 warrants for fraud against Rozier.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Tampa riot was a confrontation between white soldiers from the state of Ohio and black troops from the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Infantry Regiments on 6\u20137 June 1898.[1] The riot occurred the day before their embarkation to Cuba to fight the Spanish in the Spanish American War. The riot highlighted the racial divide that existed in the United States and the discrimination they faced as soldiers.\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Congress, in its reorganization of the U.S. military, mandated that two of the six cavalry regiments and four of its forty-five infantry regiments be made of African Americans. This was how the Ninth and Tenth U.S. Cavalry and the Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth, and Forty-first Infantry came into being.[2] In 1869 however, the four African American infantry regiments were reorganized into the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Infantry regiments, the same two regiments that would be at the center of the Tampa Riot. From the outsets, the soldiers in these regiments were ostracized from the regular army with many white officers refusing to serve with African American soldiers.[3] This refusal came in part due to the racist perception that African Americans did not make good soldiers. This notion would be disproved on the battlefield, and even as fresh recruits, the soldiers in these regiments gained a reputation for coolness under fire and an indomitable fighting spirit.[4] For the next two decades, these regiments found themselves at the forefront of numerous conflicts against Native Americans, and their fighting prowess earned them the respect of not only Native Americans but also among white soldiers. The Army and Navy Journal even declared that the comradery between white and black soldiers signaled an end to prejudice against blacks in the regular army.[5] When war broke out between Spain and the United States, the Buffalo Soldiers \"were among the first units dispatched to southern camps in preparation for the invasion of Cuba.\"[6]\nThe four units that arrived in Tampa were confronted with the discrimination of the Jim Crow South. The Tampa press was especially critical of the black soldiers, and frequently published stories painting them as undisciplined and riotous. The Tampa Daily Tribune revealed the true reason the citizens of Tampa resented the black soldiers, stating: \"The men insist upon being treated as white men are treated and the citizens will not make any distinction between the colored troops and the colored civilians.\"[7] For these soldiers who had fought with distinction on the frontier, they were appalled by the Tampa resident's efforts to demonize them and resisted efforts by the residents to enforce the practice of segregation practices that had arisen in the South.[8] Resentment toward the black soldiers was not limited to civilians. White soldiers expressed regular vitriol about the ability of black soldiers to exercise authority over them and lunged numerous racial epithets at them.[9] Through the summer of 1898, the black soldiers displayed restraint against those who insulted them, but it was clear that tensions were rising.\nOn the night of June sixth, the day before the army would embark to Cuba, a group of intoxicated Ohio volunteers \"decided to have fun\" with a young African American child.[1] They forcefully took the young boy from his mother and used him as a target to \"demonstrate their marksmanship.\"[1] The boy was unharmed but the soldier who won the coemption of marksmanship reportedly shot a bullet through the boy's shirt. For the soldiers of the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Infantry regiments, these actions by the Ohio soldiers broke any remaining restraint they possessed. The soldiers \"stormed into the streets firing their pistols indiscriminately, wrecking saloons and cafes which had refused to serve them, and forcing their way into white brothels.\"[1] The riot then quickly turned into a confrontation, not only between white civilians but also the white soldiers in the city. The Tampa police attempted to stop the riot but they were too few in number to effectively stop the regiments engaged in the riot. The riot went on well into the night and early morning before troops of the Second Georgia Volunteer Infantry arrived in the city and forcefully quelled the riot. Due to the heavy censorship the military imposed, the full scope of the riot is difficult to grasp. The Tampa Morning Tribune later denied that any riot occurred between the night of June sixth and the morning of June seventh. What is known, is that twenty-seven black troops and several soldiers from the Second Georgia were transferred because of serious injuries and corroborating reports that a bloody riot had occurred.[1]\nNews of the Tampa Riot elicited strong reactions among the public. Those who were already skeptical of the proficiency of black soldiers used this incident to claim that their mobilization was a mistake because it had allowed African Americans to \"forget his place\" in the larger social hierarchy of the United States.[10]  A West Virginian stated that he thought all African Americans should be sent to Cuba to die so a riot like what occurred in Tampa could never happen again.[11] Critically, the white press characterized the black troops of the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Infantry regiments as responsible for riot, thus erasing any trace of the role white soldiers played in the event besides the restoring of public order. The African American community was equally outraged due to reports that told of how \"many Afro-Americans were killed and scores wounded.\"[11] African American run newspapers emphasized the role the Ohio volunteers played in instigating the riot and the fact that what the Georgia volunteers had done was not maintain order but carry out an indiscriminate \"slaughter of black troops.\"[11] The divide in perception of the riot demonstrated the racist attitudes held in both the North and South towards African Americans. An African American editor from Norfolk noted that as the wounds of the Civil War and Reconstruction healed between North and South, African Americans would have \"to fight to maintain a footing.\"[11]\nUnder the cloud of the riot, the Buffalo Soldiers embarked to Cuba. On the ships, the black soldiers were segregated from their white counterparts. Despite this, the black soldiers displayed incredible gallantry. Four soldiers: William Tompkins, George Wanton, Dennis Bell, and Fitz Lee would win the Medal of Honor for rescuing Cuban and American men wounded at the mouth of the San Juan River all while under heavy fire from the Spanish.[12] The recognition these soldiers received did not, however, lessen the racism they or other African Americans faced from white Americans. White soldiers who were not selected to be a part of the main campaign in Cuba regularly let loose their frustration on the civilian population. A black-run newspaper in Jacksonville reported \"the cry of \u2018lynch him\u2019 is heard often here issuing from the throats of certain U. S. volunteer soldiers in this city.\"[13] The already present racial resentment coupled with the riot in Tampa before the soldier's departure to Cuba led to the Black soldiers being ill-received when they returned from the war, and they were engaged in daily clashes with the white populace.[13] On August 17, 1898, all of the Buffalo Soldiers were transferred out of Florida due to pressure from the white citizens of Tampa.[14]\nThe Tampa Riot and its fallout had a powerful effect on the minds of both black and white Americans. It showed both the soldiers and many other African Americans outside of the South the horrors of Jim Crow and lessened optimism that displays of patriotism would strengthen their claim \"to all the privileges of citizenship.\"[15] The event only strengthened Southern commitment to Jim Crow and the use of intimidation to ensure African Americans did not interfere with the new social order they created.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "Martin Edward Grossman (January 19, 1965 \u2013 February 16, 2010) was convicted of first degree murder for his part in the December 13, 1984, Florida killing of wildlife officer Peggy Park. He was executed by lethal injection. In the days before his execution, there were a large number of appeals for clemency, ranging from petitions to pleas, as well as a request to halt the execution from Pope Benedict XVI.[1] Grossman, a Jewish American, received strong support from national and international Jewish organizations for his death sentence to be commuted.[2][3][4]\nGrossman, an only child, grew up having to care for his mentally and physically ill father and uncle, a full-time responsibility which led to his dropping out of the ninth grade. His father died when he was 15 years old, followed shortly by his uncle, grandfather and other relatives. Grossman experienced severe depression and used alcohol and a variety of narcotics such as marijuana and PCP. He also took prescription drugs, including  Valium and barbiturates, readily available in his mother's medicine cabinet. He was also well known as a very skilled driver.[5]\nOn December 13, 1984, Margaret \"Peggy\" Park, a 26-year-old wildlife officer, came across Grossman (then aged 19) and Thayne Taylor (aged 17) shooting a stolen handgun in a wooded area of Pinellas County, Florida. Grossman, who was on probation for grand theft and other charges after burglarizing a former girlfriend's house, asked her not to turn him in for possessing a weapon and being outside Pasco County. Both were violations of his probation.[6]\nAs Park picked up her radio to call the sheriff's office, Grossman beat her on the head and shoulders with her flashlight. She was also beaten by Taylor. Park then managed to draw her gun and fire a warning shot. Grossman, a foot taller and 100 pounds heavier than Park, wrestled the gun away from her and shot her once in the back of the head. His arrest shocked family and friends who could not imagine he could be capable of such a crime.[6]\nGrossman was convicted of first-degree murder, the jury unanimously recommending the death penalty. Taylor was convicted of third-degree murder. He was released in community supervision after serving two years and 10 months of a seven-year prison term.[6]\nSupporters of Grossman alleged that his trial was improperly handled and that there was mitigating evidence to justify being granted clemency by Governor Charlie Crist, such as the influence of narcotics, and incompetence on the part of the legal teams. However, all appeals were denied, with the United States Supreme Court allowing the execution and upholding the opinion of the Florida Supreme Court that the trial was handled properly and that all evidence was allowed to be presented.[7]\nThe defense originally hired psychologist Sidney Merin, PhD, to evaluate Grossman. However, the defense did not call Merin to the stand because his evaluation of Grossman was not favorable to Grossman's case.[8][9]\nAfter Grossman was already convicted, the defense hired a second expert, North Carolina psychologist Rollin Bradshaw \"Brad\" Fisher Jr, PhD, to prepare a psychological report as part of Grossman's appeal of his conviction. Fisher wrote in his psychological report that testing on Grossman \"did not reveal any signs of a current psychotic condition or of any major affective disorder.\"[10][11]\nAs part of its post-conviction appeal, the defense claimed that a childhood evaluation of Grossman said he scored 77 on an IQ test: a score which borders on mental retardation.[5][12] Grossman's lawyers also believed that the case was not properly demonstrated and that there was a lack of sufficient evidence. Also argued was that Grossman was convicted of premeditated murder, despite Grossman maintaining he had no intention of killing Park.[13]  On the day of the execution, a final appeal was made to the United States Supreme Court for a hearing; it was ruled that the execution may proceed.[14]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Todt family murders was a multiple homicide case that occurred in December 2019 in Disney's planned community of Celebration, Florida. Anthony \"Tony\" Todt, age 44, confessed to the murders of his wife, 42-year-old Megan Todt, and their three children: Alek, age 13; Tyler, age 11; and Zoe, age 4. Anthony was a physical therapist who had recently been served a federal warrant for health care fraud charges stemming from his physical therapy business. Authorities coming to issue the warrant found the man living in his house with the badly decomposed bodies of his entire family, including the family dog. In 2022, Anthony Todt was convicted of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[1] An additional year was added for the killing of the pet dog, deemed an act of animal cruelty.[2]\nAnthony Todt's father, Robert Todt, was arrested in July 1980 and charged with hiring one of his former students to shoot and kill his wife, Loretta in order to marry his mistress. Anthony Todt was just four years old at the time, and witnessed the attack on his mother.  The would-be assassin, strictly ordered to harm no one else but Loretta, did not harm Anthony. Loretta survived the bullet to her head, and went on to remarry.[3]\nAnthony Todt dated Megan, a physical therapist and a yoga instructor, in college, and the two later married. The couple worked together at a shared physical therapy clinic they owned. After their children were born, Megan then became a stay-at-home mother, while Anthony managed their clinic.\nThe family was well known by neighbors, and the Todt children were encouraged to get involved in the arts and music. Anthony often volunteered as a youth soccer coach, and he also worked with disabled children. In 2017, according to Anthony, Megan contracted Lyme Disease after a tick bite during a trip to Disney World. She then suffered from bouts of depression, and became more reserved and isolated.\nThe Todt family moved to Celebration, Florida after living in Connecticut for several years. Anthony Todt continued working in Connecticut at the clinic, and visited the family weekly. Formerly active in their Connecticut community, the Todts were withdrawn and uninvolved with their neighbors in Celebration. By 2019, Anthony had gained a significant amount of weight and received a diagnosis of diabetes.\nIn April 2019, it was discovered that Anthony was charging patients for care that they had never received. An investigation ensued, which revealed Anthony was using the excess money to pay for the family home in Celebration, as well as trips to Disney World. Anthony had taken additional loans from firms in New York City who sued him for failure to pay; Todt was over $100,000 in debt.\nTodt initially maintained his innocence with investigators, but eventually relented and admitted to the fraud. It is believed by investigators that Megan Todt and the children had no idea about the fraud, as they were uninvolved with the business.\nAnthony Todt's motive for the murders is unclear, as his testimony about them changed multiple  times. At one point, he had claimed Megan attempted suicide by stabbing herself in her liver after killing the children;[4] in other testimony, he said he was trying to save the family from \"the Apocalypse\" and join them in the afterlife.[5]\nWhile the Todts usually returned to Connecticut from Florida during the winter to enjoy the snowy weather, in 2019, they remained in Celebration. An initial welfare check by police revealed nothing out of the ordinary, but investigators from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General and Osceola County deputies returned on January 13, 2020 after disturbing cell phone texts began appearing on family members' phones from Anthony Todt.\n",

He was the second person to be executed in Florida after capital punishment was reinstated in 1976, and at the time of his execution, had been on death row longer than anyone else in the United States. His execution generated attention when Pope John Paul II personally pleaded for clemency to spare Sullivan's life, however, Governor Bob Graham refused the appeal.[2] Sullivan was executed in 1983 and maintained his innocence to the end.[3]\nSullivan was born on July 20, 1947, in Boston, Massachusetts.[4] Two weeks after his birth, he was adopted by a couple from Nashua, New Hampshire, and was later raised in Belmont, Massachusetts by his adoptive mother, after the couple divorced.[5]\nOn the evening of April 8, 1973, Sullivan and his accomplice, Reid McLaughlin, went to a Howard Johnson's restaurant in Homestead, Florida. Sullivan had previously been employed at the restaurant for eight months as an assistant manager in 1972. At the restaurant, the pair encountered 38-year-old Donald Schmidt, the new assistant manager who worked there. Schmidt was abducted, had his hands tied behind his back with tape, and was then taken by the pair to a remote area in a swamp located in the Everglades. He was forced onto the ground where he was hit with a tire iron. He was then fatally shot four times in the back of the head by a 12 gauge shotgun. Schmidt was robbed of both his credit cards and a watch.[6]\nOn April 17, Sullivan was arrested. Police found evidence linking Sullivan to the crime, including Schmidt's credit cards, his watch, a shotgun, a handgun, tape, and a tire iron which was discovered in Sullivan's car. Sullivan reportedly confessed to the murder and implicated McLaughlin. McLaughlin confessed as well, but took a plea deal with the state where he would be given a life sentence in exchange for his testimony against Sullivan.[6]\nSullivan later denied committing the crime, claiming he had confessed to it while drunk and that his confession had been coerced. In addition, his lawyer did not contact possible witnesses that could have supported Sullivan's alibi that he was in a gay bar at the time of the murder.[7] Sullivan had reportedly told police that the motive for the crime had been robbery, and that he needed the money to pay a blackmailer who was threatening to tell his father that he was homosexual.[8]\nUltimately, Sullivan was found guilty of the crime and was convicted of first-degree murder.[9] He was sentenced to death on November 12, 1973.[10]\nThroughout Sullivan's time on death row, prison officials and Catholic priests described him as a model prisoner.[5] He was originally scheduled to be executed in June 1979, but a federal judge granted him a stay of execution.[11]\nOn November 30, 1983, Sullivan was executed in the electric chair at Florida State Prison at the age of 36. His last meal consisted of steak, french fries, milk, and fresh strawberries.[3] He was the second person to be executed in Florida since 1976, after John Spenkelink. Prior to his execution, he spent ten years and three months on death row, which at the time, was the longest amount of time any inmate had spent on death row in the United States.[12]\n",

Moore, who founded the first branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Brevard County, Florida. The murder of the Moores was the first assassination to happen during the Civil Rights Movement and the only time both a husband and a wife were killed for their activism.\nHarriette Vyda Simms was born in West Palm Beach, Florida, on June 19, 1902, to David Ira Simms (a wood lathe worker) and Annie (Warren) Simms. Her sisters were Valerie and Mae, and her brothers were George, Arnold, Rupert, and David Jr. The family relocated to Mims, Florida. As a youth, Harriette spent summers working in Massillon, Ohio with her father. She attended the segregated Daytona Normal Industrial Institute in Daytona Beach, Florida. She later graduated from Bethune-Cookman College, a historically black college in Daytona Beach, with an Associate of Arts degree in 1941 and a Bachelor of Science degree in 1950.\nSimms taught elementary school classes for many years in Merritt Island and  Mims in Brevard County, and in Lake Park, Florida until her death. In Mims, she helped to cook lunch every day for the pupils.\nSimms met Harry Tyson Moore while she was teaching classes in Brevard County. He was then working as principal of the Titusville Colored School. They married on December 25, 1926 and had two daughters together: Annie Rosalea (known as Peaches, 1928\u20131972) and Juanita Evangeline (known as Evangeline, 1930\u20132015).\n.\nSoon after the births of their daughters, the Moores founded the Brevard County chapter of the NAACP in 1934.  Harry Moore later helped to organize the statewide NAACP organization.\nIn 1946, both Moores were fired by the Brevard County public school system and blacklisted for their political activities.\nOn Christmas night, 1951, the Moores were fatally injured at their home in Mims by a bomb that went off beneath their house. It was their 25th wedding anniversary. Harry died on the way to the hospital in Sanford, Florida. Harriette died from her injuries nine days later at the hospital in Sanford.\nAlthough the state called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate, no one was indicted for the bombing and murders of the Moores. Renewed attention was brought to the case by a 1999 biography of Moore, describing him as the first civil rights martyr, and a 2000 PBS program about his life and legacy.\nThe Florida Attorney General re-opened an investigation into the murders in 2005, 54 years later. In its 2005\u20132006 reinvestigation, the State of Florida concluded that the bombing murder of the Moores had been the work of violent members of a central Florida Ku Klux Klan group and named the four chief suspects, all of whom had died.[1] There were eleven other bombings against black families in Florida the year that the Moores were killed.[2]\n",

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

Lloyd, 23, was fleeing from another MPD officer who was chasing him for an alleged traffic violation. Lozano was on foot investigating an unrelated incident, heard about the situation on his police radio and later stated the motorcycle \"veered toward him\". Lozano fired a shot at the motorcycle, striking Lloyd in the head and killing him instantly. The motorcycle crashed into an oncoming car, injuring two occupants. Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, died the following day from his injuries. Several Black witnesses stated that Lozano walked almost to the center of the street with his handgun and poised ready to shoot for several seconds as the motorcyle approached.[2] Rioting began almost immediately after the shooting in Overtown,[3][2] and on the following day in Liberty City, both predominantly Black neighborhoods of Miami, and continued until January 19 when the Chicago Bulls including star player Michael Jordan played a scheduled game in Overtown against the Miami Heat, who were in their inaugural season.[2][4] Schools were closed and police cordoned off a 130-block area and teargassed rioting crowds.[1]\nLozano was convicted of manslaughter; it was not until 2015, when Nouman Raja was charged in the shooting of Corey Jones, that another Florida law enforcement officer was sentenced for an on-duty shooting.[5] However, Lozano was granted a new trial, on the basis that the trial should not have been held in Miami, because of racial tensions, and that the prosecution should not have been allowed to introduce evidence about police procedures and Lozano's training.[6] In overturning Lozano's conviction, the appeals court argued that the jury in his trial had been influenced by fears that failing to convict would lead to further unrest.[7] A new trial was held in Orlando, Florida, and Lozano was acquitted.[6]\n",

On Wednesday, February 12, 2014, Chavez was executed at Florida State Prison in Raiford.[1]\nJuan Carlos Chavez (March 16, 1967 \u2013 February 12, 2014) was convicted of Ryce's murder. \nChavez arrived in south Florida on a raft from Cuba with two others in 1991 and was working as a farmhand at the time of the murder. Little is known about his background or family, who remained in Cuba.\nOn September 11, 1995, fifteen days before his 10th birthday, nine-year-old Ryce was riding the bus from school. He was dropped off, along with ten classmates, and had to walk less than a block to his home. According to his confession, Chavez blocked Ryce's path with his pickup truck and forced him at gunpoint into the truck. Chavez took Ryce to his trailer on a nearby ranch where he raped him. About four hours later, when he heard a helicopter hovering above, Ryce ran to the door and tried to open it only to be shot in the back by Chavez, who held the child until he took his last breath. Then, Chavez decapitated and dismembered him.\nThe child's decapitated and dismembered body was found three months later near Chavez's trailer.[2]\nChavez worked for the Scheinhaus family as a handyman. He lived in a trailer on their property. Around the time of Ryce's disappearance, Susan Scheinhaus reported several items missing from her home including a handgun and jewelry. Scheinhaus suspected Chavez, after consulting with a psychic, but had no evidence to support her suspicions. Aided by a locksmith, Scheinhaus entered Chavez's trailer. She found her handgun and young Ryce's bookbag. She reported her findings to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on December\u00a05, 1995. Chavez was found a day later and taken in for questioning.\nBeing advised of his rights and after a 55-hour-long interrogation, Chavez openly admitted to abducting, raping, and murdering Ryce. Chavez also led police to the boy's body, which was dismembered and hidden in concrete in three plastic planters.\nIn the fall of 1998, Chavez was convicted of kidnapping, sexual battery, and capital murder. He was sentenced to death. The Florida Supreme Court affirmed his conviction and sentence on November 21, 2002.[3] In July 2004, Chavez filed a motion for post-conviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The motion was amended in May 2005, and was heard in Miami-Dade Circuit Court on January 9, 2007. The circuit court judge denied the motion on March 8, 2007. On May 23, 2007, Chavez appealed the denial to the Florida Supreme Court, filing a petition for habeas corpus at the same time. The court affirmed the circuit court's order and denied the petition on June 25, 2009. The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. On April 17, 2012, Chavez filed a successor motion for post-conviction relief under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. The circuit court denied the motion on June 13, 2012. On July 20, 2012, Chavez appealed the denial to the Florida Supreme Court, which affirmed the denial on October 11, 2013.[4]\nOn January 2, 2014, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed Chavez's death warrant. Chavez, age 46, was executed by lethal injection on February 12, 2014, at 8:17\u00a0p.m. at Florida State Prison in Raiford.[5] Chavez made no final statement but issued a written message in which he wished \"unfailing love be upon us, upon me, upon those who today take the life out of this body, as well as those who in their blindness or in their pain desire my death. God bless us all.\"\n",

Payne played college basketball for the Michigan State Spartans.\nPayne played high school basketball for Jefferson High School. He posted averages of 15.6 points, 11.3 rebounds and 4.0 blocks as a senior. As a senior, he led Jefferson to a Division IV state championship and a 19\u20135 record. The Dayton Daily News named him first-team All-Area.[1] He was named a fourth-team Parade All-American.[2]\nSources:\nAs a freshman at Michigan State University, Payne averaged 2.5 points and 2.4 rebounds per game, playing in 34 games.[1] During that year he was diagnosed with permanent reduced lung capacity, an ailment which affected his stamina.[3][4][5]\nIn his sophomore season, he led the Spartans  in blocks (39) and finished seventh in the Big 10. In 37 games (36 starts), he averaged 7.0 points and 4.2 rebounds per game. He was an Academic All-Big Ten selection.[1]\nAs a junior, Payne led the Big Ten in free-throw percentage (.848) and blocked a total of 46 shots, good for sixth all-time for a Michigan State player. In 36 games (24 starts), he averaged 10.5 points and 7.6 rebounds in 25.6 minutes per game.[1] Payne was named to the Second Team All Big Ten, along with Michigan State teammates Keith Appling and Gary Harris.[6]\nComing into his senior year, Payne was on the preseason Naismith and Wooden Award watchlists.[7][8] CBS Sports selected him to the preseason Third Team All-America.[9] He was named to the Midseason Wooden Award Top 25 watchlist.[10] Payne was twice named Big Ten Player of the Week.[11][12] He missed seven games due to an ankle injury.[13] At the conclusion of the regular season Payne was named Second Team All-Big Ten.[14]\nDuring the 2013\u201314 college basketball season, Payne's friendship with Lacey Holsworth, an 8-year-old cancer patient, gained national media attention.[15] Their friendship started when Payne met Holsworth during a team-sponsored hospital visit in 2011 and the two began to text and talk frequently afterward.[16] Holsworth, who had neuroblastoma, accompanied Payne at center court on Senior Night and helped him cut down the nets after 2013\u201314 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team won the Big Ten men's basketball tournament.[17] Holsworth, also known as \"Princess Lacey\", died from her cancer on April 8, 2014.[18]\n",

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

        "paragraph": "Luis C\u00e1ncer de Barbastro or Luis de C\u00e1ncer (1500 \u2013 June 26, 1549) was a Dominican priest and pioneer Spanish missionary to the New World. He undertook a non-violent approach to converting the American Indians to Christianity, and had significant success in this regard in the Caribbean and later in Guatemala. In 1549 he continued his mission work in Florida, an area already ravaged by previous explorers, and was killed on the shores of Tampa Bay. Since his death, he has been regarded by many as a martyr.\nC\u00e1ncer was born at Barbastro in Arag\u00f3n in 1500.[1] Luis entered the Dominican order and was inspired like many of his time to go to the New World in an effort to spread Christianity.\nFray de C\u00e1ncer came to the New World in 1518 and worked successfully for some time among the native peoples of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. He then ventured to the mainland and had particular success in Guatemala. A disciple of the famed Indian protector, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, Father de C\u00e1ncer's efforts were so successful in an area that was known for its bellicose natives, that it was renamed the \u201cProvince of True Peace.\u201d He believed that aggression and violence were counter-productive to the spread of the Gospel and that the native peoples needed to be treated with dignity. He had great success in pacifying the Indians whom more violent methods had failed to subdue. He upheld the cause of the natives at an ecclesiastical assembly held in Mexico in 1546.\nFollowing his missionary success in Guatemala, C\u00e1ncer proposed a peaceful mission to Florida. The peninsula had already been ravaged by the expeditions of P\u00e1nfilo Narv\u00e1ez and Hernando de Soto and was regarded as very hostile to the Spanish, and C\u00e1ncer argued that further violence would never bring about its conversion to Catholicism and submission. In 1547, King Charles V approved C\u00e1ncer's Florida mission.[2] However, the royal decree stipulated that the mission land at Florida's upper east coast, avoiding hostile territory in southern Florida and the Gulf Coast where earlier conquistadors had gone.[3]\nC\u00e1ncer recruited fellow Dominicans Gregorio de Beteta, Diego de Tolosa, Juan Garc\u00eda, and a certain Brother Fuentes. Leaving Vera Cruz, they reached Havana in 1549. There, they took on a converted Florida Indian, Magdalena, a \"highly recommended\" interpreter. The expedition then left for Florida on a caravel captained by Juan de Arena. Despite the warnings to avoid the Gulf Coast, Arena took them to an area south of Tampa Bay, only miles from where the previous expeditions had landed. There, they encountered a group of apparently peaceful and receptive Indians, who told them about the many populous villages of the Tocobaga chiefdom around Tampa Bay. Perceiving the possibility of goodwill, the expedition split, with Magdalena, Diego de Tolosa, Brother Fuentes, and an unknown sailor joining the Indians on the half-day's land route, and C\u00e1ncer returning to the caravel to meet them at the bay.[3]\nThe caravel reached Tampa Bay on June 23, 1549, but only Magdalena and a group of Indians greeted them. Magdalena, now \"much changed\" and wearing Indian attire, told C\u00e1ncer that she had convinced the local chief that the friars were peaceful, and that the other Spaniards were now his guests. C\u00e1ncer and the others returned to the caravel that evening, and on board they found Juan Munos, a sailor who had been enslaved by the Indians years before but now escaped. Munos indicated that the Tocobaga had killed the two friars and enslaved the sailor. Beteta and Garc\u00eda wanted to flee immediately and sail for the east coast of Florida, but C\u00e1ncer refused to leave a land \"hallowed by the life blood\" of his compatriots. The next day, the three men rowed to shore, where they saw a group of hostile Indians, and C\u00e1ncer exited the boat. He waded to shore and prayed for a while. Upon rising, he was brought to the group and beaten to death with clubs.[4]\nThough not a canonized saint, he is nevertheless regarded by Catholics working for the canonization of the Martyrs of La Florida as the proto-martyr of Florida. \nIn 1860, Bishop August\u00edn Verot decided that the first parish on Florida's west coast should be named St. Louis Church in his honor. Likewise, in 1918 Fr. de C\u00e1ncer's likeness was installed as part of a large stained glass window at the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (New York) run by the Dominican Order of priests.[5] In 1998 the Diocese of St. Petersburg established the Fr. Luis de C\u00e1ncer Distinguished Priestly Service Award to be given annually to a priest of the Diocese of St. Petersburg who best exemplifies selfless and dedicated service to the people of God. Esp\u00edritu Santo Catholic Church in Safety Harbor, Florida, which is not far from the location of his death, also has a stained glass window that depicts de C\u00e1ncer's martyrdom.[6] In 2011, the diocese placed a Catholic Heritage Marker at the main entrance of that church, acknowledging both his and other early Catholic missionary efforts in the Tampa Bay area.[7]\nIn 2015, the Vatican bestowed the title \"Servant of God\" on C\u00e1ncer and 85 Native American and Spanish victims of Native American and English colonial aggression,[8][9] while it formally began to consider them for canonization as martyrs; the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has endorsed the cause.[10]\n",

After his death in 2015, he was linked to a similar murder dating back to 1985 via touch DNA analysis, and authorities are now investigating his possible involvement in other murders.\nJoseph Magaletti, Jr. was born on April 5, 1950, in White Plains, New York. Little is known about his upbringing, but as an adult, he developed a drug addiction that prevented him from holding jobs for too long, due to which Magaletti became a drifter. By the 1980s, he moved to Florida, where he made a living by working various jobs ranging from a cashier to a bouncer at a nightclub.[1]\nOn May 17, 1981, he was working at a bar named The Crown Lounge when he had to order one client, 31-year-old Irene Rubin Zayas, to leave, as he had attempted to steal a glass from the establishment.[2] Approximately ten minutes, Zayas returned armed with a pocket knife and stabbed Magaletti in the stomach, but the injuries proved minimal. Newspaper accounts from the time claimed that after being released from jail, Zayas smashed the windshield of Magaletti's car and flattened his tires.[2] It is unknown if any further charges were pressed against Zayas, or how much of an impact this incident had on Magaletti in regard to his future crimes.\nOn October 13, 1985, 28-year-old Denise Marie Stafford was found strangled to death at home in Sarasota. The discovery was made by her husband, who had just returned from work, only to find his wife murdered but their 1-year-old daughter had been unharmed.[3] One outlier in this case was that Stafford was apparently standing when she was first struck, and that her killer had moved her body after killing her, leaving behind DNA on her clothes.[1]\nOn January 9, 1987, 19-year-old Elizabeth \"Lisa\" Zea left her job at Network Video, and was last seen walking with an unfamiliar man to her car in the shopping plaza parking lot. The pair were later seen driving in the car, but all trace of Zea after that was lost.[4] The following day, a passer-by walking through a residential area in Sarasota passed by a car and noticed that the woman inside was dead. The car, a red 1980 Toyota Corolla, matched the description of Zea's car, and the body was sent for an autopsy for possible identification.[4] A day after, the body was positively identified as Zea, and it was later revealed that she had been beaten to death.[5] Following this, her brother devoted a large portion of his time discussing his sister's murder both in interviews and in person, culminating in the foundation of a committee that aimed to raise a $10,000 prize for anyone that could provide information leading to Zea's killer.[6] In September of that year, the police department released a facial composite seeking a supposed \"key witness\" in the case, but this man was never located.[7]\nOn or about March 10, 1995, 45-year-old Kathleen Leonard, a nurse who worked at a hospital in Sarasota, stopped showing up to work. When she failed to turn up in the following days, one of her co-workers reported her missing to the police and a search began for her.[8] When they checked the apartment, officers found Leonard's body in her bedroom. Her hands had been bound with a towel behind her back, and she appeared to have been strangled with terrycloth.\nA week after Leonard's killing, Magaletti was arrested for burglary and robbery in relation to two separate incidents in which he had robbed a female acquaintance's house and had threatened to kill her.[9] In the meantime, detectives investigating the crime scene of the Leonard murder found a strand of hair and palm prints that matched Magaletti, her neighbor at the time, but as this was not considered sufficient evidence for an arrest, he was not charged.[10]\nFive years later, the hair and a sample from Magaletti were sent to a laboratory in North Carolina, where they hoped that the advancements of DNA technology could help them. Using touch DNA analysis, it was confirmed that Magaletti had been present at the crime scene when Leonard had been murdered resulting in his subsequent arrest.[11] While he vehemently denied responsibility, Magaletti would later be charged, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder on June 15, 2001.[1]\n",

The circumstances of his execution elevated objections to the use of electrocution as a means of capital punishment. During his execution, Medina's head burst into flames, filling the death chamber with smoke. An autopsy later revealed that the current had destroyed Medina's brain, killing him instantly.\nMedina was among nearly 125,000 Cubans who were sent to the United States during the 1980 Mariel boatlift. He eventually lived with his half-sister in Orlando. His victim, Dorothy James, an elementary school gym teacher, lived in an apartment next door. James befriended Medina.\nDorothy James was found dead in her apartment on April 4, 1982. She had been gagged, stabbed multiple times, and left to die. Early in the morning of April 8, 1982, Medina was found asleep in James' automobile at a rest area on Interstate 10 near Lake City and was arrested for theft of the automobile. The next day, detectives from Orange County, Florida investigating the murder of James interviewed Medina in the Columbia County Jail about the auto theft and the murder. Medina's explanation of how he came to be in James' vehicle was not believed by the detectives. \nMedina was arrested and indicted for the murder of James. Medina requested a psychiatric examination and was examined by two psychiatrists. Each determined that Medina met the statutory criteria for competence to stand trial. The trial court found Medina competent to stand trial.\nMedina was tried before a jury in Orange County on March 15\u201318, 1983. Medina testified in his own defense and denied murdering James. However, Medina admitted being in James' apartment the night of the murder and that he was in James' apartment when James was dead. Medina also admitted that a hat found by police detectives on a bed near James' body was his hat and that he took James' automobile after she was murdered. Medina admitted driving James' automobile to Tampa and offering to sell the automobile to a man with whom he engaged in a fight at the time of the attempted sale. The man to whom Medina was selling the automobile testified that he gave Medina $250 for the automobile, but then Medina left with the automobile. When law enforcement officers searched the vehicle following Medina's arrest, a knife was found in the vehicle.\nMedina was convicted of first-degree murder and auto theft. The jury, by a ten-to-two vote, recommended the death penalty for the murder conviction. The trial court found two aggravating circumstances and a single mitigating circumstance. The court found the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstance and sentenced Medina to death. This Court affirmed Medina's convictions and sentences. (Medina v. State, 466 So.2d 1046 (Fla. 1985)).\nHe was sent to death row at Florida State Prison near the town of Starke in 1982. Medina's last words before being executed on March 25, 1997, were, \"I am still innocent.\"[1] During the administration of electric current, the electric chair known as \"Old Sparky\" malfunctioned, causing flames to shoot out of Medina's head.[2]\nIn 1999, the state of Florida heard a petition from Thomas Harrison Provenzano, another death row inmate, that argued that the electric chair was a \"cruel and unusual punishment\". During the proceedings, Rev. Glen Dickson, Medina's pastor, testified he saw the flames rising out of Medina's head, smelled an acrid smell and saw Medina take three labored breaths after the electric current to the chair had been turned off and the strap holding him in it had been loosened.\n",

After graduating high school, 19-year-old Durousseau found himself working as a security guard. His first offenses as an adult took place on December 18, 1991, and January 21, 1992, for carrying a concealed firearm in California.[3]\nIn November 1992, Durousseau enlisted in the U.S. Army[3] and was stationed in Germany, where he met Natoca, who would later become his wife. The two married in 1995 in Las Vegas. In 1996, they were transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia. On March 13, 1997, Durousseau was arrested for kidnapping and raping a young woman. However, in August of that year he was cleared of those charges. Soon after, he was found in possession of stolen goods. He was court-martialed in January 1999, found guilty and dishonorably discharged from the Army.[4]:\u200a3\u200a\nDurousseau and his wife moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where they had two daughters. It was during that period that he committed most of the murders. He struggled to keep jobs to make ends meet, and the couple would often have fights over the issue of finances. In 1999, the police advised Durousseau's wife on how to file for a restraining order after he allegedly slapped her in the face and grabbed her by the neck. Later, she testified he got violently angry when she talked about getting a divorce. In September and October 2001, Durousseau spent 48 days in jail for domestic battery.[4]\nDurousseau still managed to hold various legitimate jobs. In 2001, he was hired as a school bus driver and an animal control worker despite being a convicted felon. In 2003, he worked as a taxi driver and it is now accepted that this is how he first came into contact with some of his victims. It was erroneously reported that Gator City Taxi Company failed to run a background check on Durousseau;[5] the City of Jacksonville was responsible for the background check, and issued Durousseau's taxi driver permit.[6]\nNeighbors and friends described Durousseau as a \"lewd womanizer\". He often asked young women when they planned to \"make flicks\" with him. A witness recalled Durousseau hitting on a girl that appeared to be around 13 or 14 years old.[7]\nLess than one month after the acquittal over the rape charges, the nude body of 26-year-old Tracy Habersham was found on September 7, 1997, in Fort Benning.[8] She had been missing for 48 hours and was last seen leaving a party. She had been raped and strangled to death with a cord. Durousseau was not a suspect in the murder, but DNA would later tie him to the crime. He later confessed to Habersham's killing after his arrest.[3][9]\nIn 1999, Durousseau raped and killed 24-year-old Tyresa Mack in her apartment. Witnesses saw him leave her place carrying a television.[10][unreliable source?] In 2001, he was arrested for raping a young woman in Jacksonville. He spent 30 days in jail and received two years' probation. On December 19, 2002, 18-year-old Nicole L. Williams' body was found wrapped in a blue blanket at the bottom of a ditch in Jacksonville. She had been reported missing two days earlier.[8]\nOn January 1, 2003, family members of 19-year-old Nikia Kilpatrick went to check on her. They had not had any news from her for several days. They found her body in the bedroom of her apartment. She had been raped then killed by strangulation with a cord two days before. Her two sons, an eleven-month-old and a two-year-old, were alive but malnourished. Kilpatrick was approximately six months pregnant at the time of her death.[4] Eight days later, 20-year-old nurse assistant Shawanda Denise McCalister, who was also pregnant at the time of her death, was raped and strangled in her Jacksonville apartment. The murder scene was almost identical to that of Kilpatrick. She was killed on Durousseau's first day of driving a cab for Gator City Taxi. Her body was found the following day.\n",

        "paragraph": "On November 15, 1937 the Ku Klux Klan raid of La Paloma nightclub occurred in an unincorporated area of Miami-Dade County. An estimated 200 Ku Klux Klan members stormed the popular LGBT-serving nightclub, patrons were ordered to leave and the nightclub was shut down for the evening.[1]\nMiami had recently begun to shift to cater to tourists. Local businesses intended to draw tourist money by offering Miami as a more modern alternative to Havana. To cater to tourists, many local businesses expected a relaxed approach from the vice police to gambling, and more acceptance of foreigners. Some grew frustrated with Miami's new tourism-based economy and began an anti-vice crusade. These included  construction workers affected by business failings in the area. This crusade began during Prohibition and led to the revitalization of the Ku Klux Klan in the Miami area.[2]\nLa Paloma nightclub's performance offerings included early drag queens known as \"female impersonators\" singing and telling jokes, women stripping. It was generally understood to cater specifically to LGBT patrons. Many locals called it indecent. Club owner Al Youst had already been arrested six times, but to many residents it seemed that the arrests would not shut the club down.[2]\nOn the night of November 15, 1937 hooded members of the Ku Klux Klan gathered at Miami's Moore Park to induct 125 new members.[3] They burned a cross before they assaulted the La Paloma nightclub.[1]\nFor the first time in ten years the Ku Klux Klan conducted a \"night ride\" in the Miami area. Around 200 \"night riders\" (members responsible for burnings and floggings) walked directly into the nightclub.[4] Klan members began smashing furniture, roughing up workers, threatening to burn the building down, all while ordering everyone out of the club.[5] One Klan member explained during the attack that \"the visit came because neighborhood residents were afraid of Youst and did not want to appear against him in a court complaint.\"[3]\nSoon after the Ku Klux Klan raid, Dade County Sheriff David Coleman called the club a \"menace\" and vowed to keep it legally closed. Coleman ordered the nightclub to stop operations after the Ku Klux Klan raid and then ordered a police raid there two weeks later.[2]\nLa Paloma reopened again within weeks, though.[6] The club's manager would claim the club offered \u201cspicier entertainment than ever\u201d. A new skit performed at the club featured performers satirizing the Klan raid and donning white hoods.[1]\nA stronger sense of unity came to Miami's LGBT community, and La Paloma nightclub became a symbol of LGBT resistance in the city.[1]\n\n",

        "paragraph": "\nCourtney Christine Schulhoff (born December 27, 1987[1] in Washington, D.C.) is an American prisoner who was convicted in the bludgeoning death of her father in his Altamonte Springs, Florida apartment when she was 16 years old.[2] She was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in September 2006.[3] In March 2017, Schulhoff was given a reduced sentence of 40 years.[4]\nCourtney Schulhoff lived in Altamonte Springs, Florida with her father after her parents divorced.[5] She attended Lyman High School, but had dropped out and was pursuing her GED.[6] Before dropping out of school, 15-year-old Schulhoff began dating Michael Morin, a man whom she had met at a dog race track across the street from her high school.[6] Morin, who was five years Schulhoff's senior, was on probation for car theft after stealing his father's car.[7] Schulhoff's father did not approve of their relationship but the couple continued to date. They would often hang out at a local gas station where Schulhoff reportedly told Morin that her father physically abused her regularly.[8]\nOn the night of February 9, 2004, Schulhoff's father Stephen was beaten to death inside his apartment.[9][10] After the murder, Schulhoff and Morin reportedly drove to a McDonald's 20 miles away in Orlando, Florida using Stephen Schulhoff's truck.[11] Later in the afternoon, the couple returned to the apartment. Morin later said that he and Schulhoff had planned to take her father's body to Brevard County and throw it off a bridge.[12]\nSchulhoff and Morin were apprehended on February 11 after Stephen Schulhoff's girlfriend, Elaine Bouck, came to the apartment to check on Stephen.  Bouck called 911 after seeing the couple flee from the apartment.[12] Schulhoff later told police that she and Morin had decided to kill her father after her father had beaten her on February 9.[8] She initially claimed that while she was out taking her father's dog for a walk, Morin had decided to \"take care of the problem\" and kill Stephen. Schulhoff claimed that when she returned to the apartment, she discovered Morin covered in blood and saw the baseball bat by the front door. She stated that Morin admitted to killing her father and threatened to kill her if she called authorities. Morin denied that he had initiated the killing, stating that Schulhoff left the Louisville Slugger baseball bat used to kill Stephen Schulhoff outside the bedroom door for him to use.[13] Morin claimed that he had tried to talk Schulhoff out of killing her father, to no avail. He also claimed to have no memory of beating Stephen Schulhoff stating that he \"blacked out\" as soon as he grabbed the bat and only became lucid when he was washing the blood off his body after the attack.[12] In a second interview with police, Schulhoff admitted that she waited at the apartment's tennis court area while Morin killed her father and intentionally left the baseball bat by the door for Morin.[13]\nCourtney Schulhoff was the first of the defendants to stand trial. Her trial began on September 26, 2006.[14] Prosecutors alleged that although Michael Morin had committed the murder, Schulhoff had orchestrated it.[15] She did not testify in her own defense at the trial. The next day, she was found guilty of first-degree murder.[3] Because she was only 16 when the murder was committed, she was ineligible for the death penalty; on September 27, 2006, she was sentenced to life without parole.[3] After the judge handed down the obligatory sentence, Courtney Schulhoff spoke out in open court, stating: \"Your Honor, I would like to openly admit in court that Michael Morin is not the person who killed my father. I was. So, I accept full responsibility, and I accept the verdict.\"[3]\nMichael Morin's murder trial began on April 16, 2007. Unlike his former girlfriend, he was facing a death sentence if convicted.[16] During his testimony, he admitted killing Stephen Schulhoff but expressed regret for the action.[16] At the trial, Schulhoff also testified in Morin's defense. She had given a new deposition after her conviction, and stated that she was the one who had bludgeoned Stephen Schulhoff to death with the baseball bat.[17] However, on April 26, 2007, Michael Morin was convicted.[18] He was sentenced to life in prison without parole, and is serving his sentence at the Taylor Correctional Institution.[19]\nIn 2009, Schulhoff was interviewed at the Lowell Correctional Institution in Ocala, Florida by RTL, a German news show, about the punishment of life without parole for juvenile offenders.[20] In 2011, her case appeared on an episode of Snapped on the Oxygen Network. In 2015, Schulhoff was interviewed by former FBI criminal profiler Candice DeLong for the Investigation Discovery program Facing Evil.\nIn 2017, Schulhoff was given a reduced sentence of 40 years.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "On July 19, 2018, Markeis McGlockton, 28, was fatally shot by Michael Drejka at a parking lot outside a local convenience store in Clearwater, Florida, United States. Shortly before the shooting, Drejka approached McGlockton's car and began to confront McGlockton's girlfriend for parking in a disabled parking space without a placard. McGlockton came out of the store and shoved Drejka to the ground. At this point, Drejka drew his handgun and McGlockton began to back away. Five seconds after Drejka hit the ground, he shot McGlockton. McGlockton later died from his injuries at a local hospital. He was unarmed at the time he was shot.[1]\nDrejka, a 47-year-old man, was not initially charged for the killing by the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, with Sheriff Bob Gualtieri citing Florida's stand-your-ground law as the reason. The investigation was then handed over to the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida State Attorney Bernie McCabe, who charged Drejka with one count of manslaughter on August 13, 2018. Drejka pleaded not guilty to the charge. His trial began on August 19, 2019. Drejka was convicted of manslaughter on August 23, 2019, and was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty years on October 10, 2019.[2] The incident was widely reported by news media as another instance of Florida's controversial stand-your-ground law, six years after the killing of Trayvon Martin generated international attention and debate.[3]\nMarkeis Deon McGlockton (March 28, 1990 \u2013 July 19, 2018)[4][5] grew up in Clearwater, Florida, and formerly lived in St. Petersburg.[6] Within Pinellas County Schools, McGlockton attended middle school in St. Petersburg; and attended Boca Ciega High School but later dropped out.[6]\nIn 2009, McGlockton met Britany Jacobs through a friend while she was a student at Dunedin High School.[7] The couple had three children together during his lifetime.[6] Jacobs publicly revealed her pregnancy with their fourth child in December 2018.[8][9][10]\nMcGlockton used to work at Burger King.[6] He later worked nights as a clerk at a 7-Eleven until his death.[6] While Jacobs worked in the daytime as a certified nursing assistant,[7] McGlockton was a stay-at-home dad for their children.[6][11]\nMichael Andrew Drejka (born August 5, 1970) originally lived in Delaware. His father was a Delaware State Trooper.[12] He had a concealed carry license.[13] Drejka worked for Asplundh Tree Expert Company as a tree-trimmer and often performed cleanup work.[14] He quit the tree-trimming business in 2007 and lived with his girlfriend Cara Lynne Brooks.[15] In 2010, Drejka moved to Pinellas County, where he got married.[12] He later worked as an Uber driver until problems with his vehicle forced him to quit.[15][16]\nOn the afternoon of July 19, 2018, McGlockton picked up Jacobs from her employer with their three children in the vehicle, reportedly a 2016 Chrysler\u00a0200.[7][17] Jacobs took over the wheel and drove the family to the Circle A Food Store so McGlockton could buy snacks for the children.[7] Jacobs illegally parked the vehicle in the store's only handicapped parking space,[clarification needed] located on the side of the building.[7][failed verification] McGlockton went into the store with their five-year-old son, Markeis\u00a0Jr.[17]\nWhile Jacobs was sitting inside the vehicle, Drejka pulled up in his Toyota 4-Runner, also parking illegally, [18] after having come from the WaWa on Missouri Ave in Largo.[17][19][failed verification] Drejka got out of his SUV and searched for a disabled parking placard on Jacobs' vehicle.[20] Video surveillance shows Drejka starting a confrontation with Jacobs over the parking space.[21] She had the other two children, aged three years and four months, seated in the car at the time.[21] McGlockton had not yet finished checking out when he overheard the store clerk being informed of the situation.[22]\nAround 3:30 pm, video surveillance shows McGlockton walked out of the store and walked up to Drejka and shoved him to the ground and kept walking towards him.[17] Three seconds later, Drejka pulled out a .40-caliber Glock, which he steadied with both hands. McGlockton immediately backed up when confronted with the firearm. As McGlockton backed up to his vehicle he began to turn towards the front of the store and away from Drejka. Drejka then fired a single shot striking McGlockton in the chest.[22][23] After being shot, McGlockton ran back into the store and collapsed in front of his son.[17][24] Paramedics arrived 19 minutes later and rushed McGlockton to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 4:04 pm.[17]\n",

After the acquittal of officers who had beaten to death a small time drug dealer named Leonardo Mercado, locals rioted causing $3 million in property damage. The incident would later be called the Mercado riot.[1]\nBy 1990 the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami was generally impoverished and home to many Puerto Rican residents.[2] Local Puerto Ricans had noted how little Puerto Rican representation existed in Miami. After the riot Emilio Lopez, president of the Borinquen Health Care Center in Wynwood would go on to say \"I dare you to find in the city of Miami a Puerto Rican in a position of authority\", and \"If he is, he is so entangled with the establishment that he won't do anything for his people.\"[3]\nLeonardo Mercado was a suspected small time drug dealer in the neighborhood. Police officers Pablo Camacho, Andy Watson, Tom Trujillo, Charlie Haynes,  and Nathaniel Veal Jr. (members of the Miami Police Department's undercover Street Narcotics Unit) confronted Mercado. In 1988 they met Mercado outside his apartment because of a suspected death threat he had made. The officers ordered him inside his apartment then allegedly proceeded to beat him to death. The officers were charged each with one count of conspiracy and three counts of civil rights violations. On December 3, 1990 all the officers were acquitted.[4]\nOn December 3, 1990 the day of the officers acquittal, a mob erupted into violence in the Wynwood neighborhood shortly after 6:30pm.[4] Many of the rioters were Puerto Rican residents. One local, Clemente Montalvo, told The New York Times about the riot, \u201cWe want people to know we exist. Cubans get everything; we get nothing.\u201d[5] For about three hours the neighborhood was put under siege by the mob until 200 patrolmen restored order to the neighborhood. Many cars were overturned and businesses set ablaze, but no serious injuries or deaths were reported.[6]\n",

Knight, who was driving, flipped on the police car's emergency lights and stopped the car near the intersection at 16th Street.\nIn court documents, Knight says he told the driver, 18-year-old Tyron Lewis, to turn off the car's engine and show his hands. Instead, Knight says, Lewis bumped him at least six times with the car. Witnesses would later say Lewis' car rolled at the speed of a baby's crawl. Lewis' passenger, Eugene Young, who was not shot, recalled Lewis saying: \"Please don't shoot, please don't shoot, I ain't even got nothing!\" Knight told his partner to smash the car's windows with her baton. As she did, Knight says Lewis attempted to turn the car. Knight was knocked onto the gold hood. He fired his Glock semiautomatic pistol three times, hitting Lewis twice in the arm and once in the chest. He died at the scene.[1]\nDuring the investigation immediately following this event, a large crowd had gathered and became agitated due to the police department not sharing information and a number of witnesses describing events. The situation quickly got out of hand and the crowd began throwing rocks, bottles, and other items at police officers.[2]\nPolice officers received reinforcements from other local agencies and off-duty St. Petersburg Police officers. As officers and Sheriff deputies shot tear gas into the crowd and dispersed the initial crowd at 16th Street and 18th Avenue South, a number of individuals continued rioting through the area of St. Petersburg known as Midtown.\nAt least 20 people were arrested and 28 arson fires were confirmed as groups of youths ran back and forth throughout the night, throwing rocks, bricks and bottles at officers in riot gear, businesses and passing cars.[2] At least 11 people were injured, including a police officer who was shot and a newspaper photographer who was beaten, as hundreds of people swarmed through the streets after the shooting on October 24.[3] Stores were looted and thick smoke clouded the neighborhood just south of downtown.[4] In total, the rioters were responsible for an approximate $5 million in property damage.[5]\nMedia outlets published different versions of the initial incident. The media outlets in and around the St. Petersburg area included the information that the car Lewis was driving was suspected of being stolen. Media outlets outside the area only mentioned that Lewis was pulled over for speeding. The car was actually reported stolen but, after further investigation, was found to have been sold to Lewis for an undetermined amount of crack cocaine, then reported stolen by the seller.[6]\nAfter the rioting, Officer James Knight and his partner Sandra Minor were put on paid leave while investigation into their actions took place.[7] Within a few weeks, the two officers were cleared of all charges by a grand jury, igniting further rioting on November 13 and 14.[8][9][10] The Grand Jury had decided that Officer Knight shooting Lewis was reasonable and it was not racially motivated, and this led to further riots.[5] Not even a few hours after the Grand Jury's ruling, the riots worsened and over 30 fires were started, two police officers and two firefighters were injured (one of them a police helicopter pilot who was hit by gunfire), and dozens were arrested.\n",

She was also convicted for the 1980 murder of her son Michael Buenoano and of the 1983 attempted murder of her boyfriend John Gentry. Buenoano is also acknowledged to have been responsible for the 1978 death of her boyfriend Bobby Joe Morris in Colorado; however, by the time authorities made the connection between Buenoano and Morris, she had already been sentenced to death in the state of Florida.[1]\nBuenoano is also believed to have been involved in a 1974 murder in Alabama, and in the 1980 death of her boyfriend Gerald Dossett. After her arrest, Dossett's body was exhumed and analyzed for signs of arsenic poisoning. No charges were laid in that case. Buenoano was the first woman to be executed in Florida since 1848 or electrocuted in USA since 1976.[2]\nJudias Welty was born and raised in Texas, the third of four siblings. Her mother died when she was four, and she was sent along with her baby brother Robert, to live with her grandparents. After her father remarried, they moved to live with him in Roswell, New Mexico. She was reportedly abused by her father and stepmother, who starved her and forced her to work as a slave. When she was fourteen, she spent two months in prison for attacking her father, stepmother and two stepbrothers. Upon being released, she chose to attend reform school in where she graduated in 1960 becoming a nursing assistant. She gave birth to Michael, an illegitimate son the following year.[1]\nJudy Welty was married to James Goodyear (born December 7, 1933), a sergeant in the U.S. Air Force. He died on September 16, 1971 in Orlando, Florida. His death was initially believed to be due to natural causes.[3]\nIn 1973, she moved in with Bobby Joe Morris (born 1939). In January 1978, he died in Trinidad, Colorado by poison. Later that year, she legally changed her name to \"Buenoano\" (corrupted Spanish for \"good year\").\n[4]\nIn 1979, Buenoano's son Michael (March 30, 1961\u00a0\u2013 May 13, 1980) became severely ill, with symptoms including paraplegia.[5] On May 13, 1980, Buenoano took Michael out in a canoe; the canoe rolled, and Michael, weighed down by his arm and leg braces, drowned. Following Michael's death, Buenoano opened a beauty salon.[1]\nIn 1983, Buenoano was in a relationship with John Gentry. Gentry was severely injured when his car exploded after a friend gathering in Pensacola, Florida.[6] While he was recovering from his injuries, police began to find several discrepancies in Buenoano's background. Further investigation revealed that, in November 1982, she had begun telling her friends that Gentry was suffering from a terminal illness.[3][7]\n\"Vitamin pills\" which Buenoano had been giving Gentry contained arsenic and paraformaldehyde. Exhumations of Michael Goodyear, James Goodyear, and Bobby Joe Morris showed that all had died of arsenic poisoning. Buenoano received substantial life insurance payouts after each death.\nIn 1984, Buenoano was convicted for the murder of Michael and the attempted murder of Gentry.[7] In 1985 she was convicted of the murder of James Goodyear.[7] She received a twelve-year sentence for the Gentry case, a life sentence for the Michael Buenoano case, and a death sentence for the James Goodyear case. She was convicted of multiple counts of grand theft (for insurance fraud), and is thought to have committed multiple acts of arson (again, for purposes of insurance fraud).\n",

        "paragraph": "The shooting of Christopher Penley, a 15-year-old boy, occurred on January 13, 2006, at Milwee Middle School in Longwood, Florida. During class, Penley took out an Airsoft gun that was designed to look realistic. Penley ran from the room and eventually entered a restroom area.  SWAT officers arrived on the scene and tried to negotiate with him. Penley pointed the Airsoft gun at an officer, who responded by shooting Penley.\nPenley had briefly taken classmate Maurice Cotey hostage in a classroom and then later barricaded himself in an outdoor bathroom at Milwee Middle School in Longwood, Florida, with an Airsoft gun painted entirely black to disguise it as a Beretta 92. After the weapon was discovered by Cotey, Penley forced him into the closet and shut off the lights in the classroom. The student immediately fled and informed security and later phoned police. SWAT arrived on the scene shortly thereafter, while a negotiator attempted to initiate contact with Penley. After a twenty-minute stand-off he aimed the pistol at Lieutenant Michael Weippert who responded by shooting him.\nHe was transported to Orlando Regional Medical Center where he remained on life support for two days before dying of his wounds. Several of his organs were removed and used as transplants. Seminole County Sheriff Don Eslinger said the boy was suicidal and would not respond to negotiators who tried to talk him down in the bathroom.\nSome students at the school told the media after the incident that they knew he had \"something planned\". Police have been criticized for initiating action instead of waiting for Penley's father to arrive so that his father might convince him to surrender. The Orlando Sentinel reported that Ralph Penley was not told of events until after his son was shot. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigated the shooting and found it entirely justified, as Penley aimed an apparent weapon at the deputy.\nPenley's organs were donated by his family. His death gave nine people vital organs. Christopher Penley has also had a game room at the Landmark Church dedicated to him and a Youth center. The youth center the Adolescent Life Coaching Center opened in honor of Christopher Penley's memory and to give a place for the voice of youth to be heard.\nPenley's family filed a lawsuit against police; however, a judge dismissed the suit after determining that the shooting was justified.[1]\n",

Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes tied to a concrete block around their necks. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted billboards bearing enlarged images of the suspect's handwriting recovered from a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting.\nPrior to his arrest, Chandler worked as an unlicensed aluminum-siding contractor. Against the advice of his attorneys, he testified in his own defense, saying he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions. Chandler said he never saw them again, except in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution. During his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he did not have a single visitor.\nChandler was executed on November 15, 2011. He wrote a last statement to prison officials: \"You are killing a [sic] innocent man today\". The statement was read at a post-execution news conference. In February 2014, DNA evidence identified Chandler as the murderer of Ivelisse Berrios-Beguerisse, who was found dead in Coral Springs, Florida, on November 27, 1990.\nChandler was the fourth of five children born to Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson, and was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio.[1] When he was ten\u00a0years old in June 1957, his father hanged himself in the basement of the family's apartment.[1] At the funeral, Chandler jumped into his father's open grave as the gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt.[1][2] Between May and September 1991\u200d\u2014\u200cconcurrent with the police investigation of the Rogers family triple murder\u200d\u2014\u200cChandler was an informant for the U.S. Customs Bureau's Tampa office.[2][3]\nWhen Chandler was fourteen, he began stealing cars and was arrested twenty times as a juvenile.[1] As an adult, he was charged with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery.[4] He was also accused of masturbating while peeping through a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple's home, held them at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear, tied her up, and rubbed the barrel of his revolver across her stomach.[2]\nOn May 26, 1989, Joan \"Jo\" Rogers, 36, and her daughters\u200d\u2014\u200cMichelle, 17, and Christe, 14\u200d\u2014\u200cleft their family dairy farm in Willshire, Ohio, for a vacation in Florida.[5][6] It was the first time they had left their home state. Authorities believe Joan became lost on June 1 during the return drive from Orlando to Willshire, and had decided to take an extra vacation day in Tampa.[7] While looking for their hotel they encountered Chandler, who gave them directions and offered to meet them again later to take them on a sunset cruise of Tampa Bay.[1] Joan and her teenage daughters had left Orlando around 9:00\u00a0a.m.[8] and checked into the Days Inn on Route 60 at 12:30\u00a0p.m.[9]\nPhotographs retrieved from a roll of film found in a camera in the Rogers' hotel room showed Michelle sitting on the floor. The last photograph was taken from the hotel balcony and showed the sun beginning to set over Tampa Bay, confirming that all three family members were alive and had not left their hotel room as the sunset began.[10] They were last seen alive at the hotel's restaurant at around 7:30\u00a0p.m. It is believed they boarded Chandler's boat by the dock on the Courtney Campbell Causeway\u2014part of Route 60\u2014between 8:30\u00a0p.m. and 9:00\u00a0p.m., and that they were dead by 3\u00a0a.m. the next day.[11] Chandler may have used the fact that he was born in Ohio to lure them into feeling a connection to him.[12] Chandler knew Joan and her daughters were not from Florida because he saw the Ohio license plates on their car.[13][14]\nThe victims' bodies were found floating in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989.[15] The first body was found when several people on board a sailboat crossing under the Sunshine Skyway saw an object in the water.[16] The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles (3\u00a0km) north of the first. While the Coast Guard were recovering the second body, a call about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards (200\u00a0m) to the east, was received. All three female bodies were found floating face down, bound with a rope around the neck, and naked below the waist.[17]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Rosewood massacre was a racially motivated massacre of black people and the destruction of a black town that took place during the first week of January 1923 in rural Levy County, Florida, United States. At least six black people and two white people were killed, but eyewitness accounts suggested a higher death toll of 27 to 150. The town of Rosewood was destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black men in the years before the massacre,[2] including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.[citation needed]\nBefore the massacre, the town of Rosewood had been a quiet, primarily black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been assaulted by a black drifter. A mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. For several days, survivors from the town hid in nearby swamps until they were evacuated to larger towns by train and car. No arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black and white residents; none of them ever moved back, none of them were ever compensated for the loss of their land, and the town ceased to exist.\nAlthough the rioting was widely reported around the United States at the time, few official records documented the event. The survivors, their descendants, and the perpetrators all remained silent about Rosewood for decades. Sixty years after the rioting, the story of Rosewood was revived by major media outlets when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s. The survivors and their descendants all organized in an attempt to sue the state for failing to protect Rosewood's black community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned a report on the incident. As a result of the findings, Florida compensated the survivors and their descendants for the damages which they had incurred because of racial violence. The incident was the subject of a 1997 feature film which was directed by John Singleton. In 2004, the state designated the site of Rosewood as a Florida Heritage Landmark.\nOfficially, the recorded death toll during the first week of January 1923 was eight (six blacks and two whites). Some survivors' stories claim that up to 27 black residents were killed, and they also assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths. Minnie Lee Langley, who was in the Carrier house when it was besieged, recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house.[3] A newspaper article which was published in 1984 stated that estimates of up to 150 victims may have been exaggerations.[4] Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave which was filled with the bodies of black people; one of them remembers seeing 26 bodies being covered with a plow which was brought from Cedar Key. However, by the time authorities investigated these claims, most of the witnesses were dead or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories.[5]\nRosewood was settled in 1847, nine miles (14\u00a0km) east of Cedar Key, near the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the local economy drew on the timber industry; the name Rosewood refers to the reddish color of cut cedar wood. Two pencil mills were founded nearby in Cedar Key; local residents also worked in several turpentine mills and a sawmill three miles (4.8\u00a0km) away in Sumner, in addition to farming of citrus and cotton.  The hamlet grew enough to warrant the construction of a post office and train depot on the Florida Railroad in 1870, but it was never incorporated as a town.[3]\nInitially, Rosewood had both black and white settlers.  When most of the cedar trees in the area had been cut by 1890, the pencil mills closed, and many white residents moved to Sumner. By 1900, the population in Rosewood had become predominantly black.  The village of Sumner was predominantly white, and relations between the two communities were relatively amicable.[6] Two black families in Rosewood named Goins and Carrier were the most powerful. The Goins family brought the turpentine industry to the area, and in the years preceding the attacks were the second largest landowners in Levy County.[7] To avoid lawsuits from white competitors, the Goins brothers moved to Gainesville, and the population of Rosewood decreased slightly.[3] The Carriers were also a large family, primarily working at logging in the region. By the 1920s, almost everyone in the close-knit community was distantly related to each other.[8] The population of Rosewood peaked in 1915 at 355 people. Florida had effectively disenfranchised black voters since the start of the 20th century by high requirements for voter registration; both Sumner and Rosewood were part of a single voting precinct counted by the U.S. Census. In 1920, the combined population of both towns was 638 (344 black and 294 white).[9]\nAs was common in the late 19th century South, Florida had imposed legal racial segregation under Jim Crow laws requiring separate black and white public facilities and transportation.[10] Black and white residents created their own community centers: by 1920, the residents of Rosewood were mostly self-sufficient.  They had three churches, a school, a large Masonic Hall, a turpentine mill, a sugarcane mill, a baseball team named the Rosewood Stars, and two general stores, one of which was white-owned.  The village had about a dozen two-story wooden plank homes, other small two-room houses, and several small unoccupied plank farm and storage structures.[3] Some families owned pianos, organs, and other symbols of middle-class prosperity. Survivors of Rosewood remember it as a happy place.  In 1995, survivor Robie Mortin recalled at age 79 that when she was a child there, that \"Rosewood was a town where everyone's house was painted. There were roses everywhere you walked. Lovely.\"[11]\nRacial violence at the time was common throughout the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. Lynchings reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy; white supremacists used it as a means of social control throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens.[12] Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing, by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democratic-dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following.[13] Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in the North. In the South, black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.[14]\nElected officials in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905\u20131909) suggested finding a location out of state for black people to live separately. Tens of thousands of people moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913\u20131917) and Sidney Catts (1917\u20131921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state.[6] By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.[3]\n",

He released 17-year-old Lisa McVey after 26 hours. McVey provided critical information to the police that enabled them to arrest Long. Long was also a serial rapist.\nLong was sentenced to death for two of the ten murders he was suspected of committing. He was executed by lethal injection on May 23, 2019.\nRobert Joseph Long was born on October 14, 1953 in Kenova, West Virginia, to Joe and Louetta Long.[2] Long was born with an extra X chromosome, also known as 47,XXY, a specific variant of Klinefelter syndrome. This condition results in excessive estrogen production yielding some female traits such as breast development. Long was teased as a child for his large breasts and underwent breast reduction surgery in adolescence.[3] He had also suffered multiple head injuries as a child resulting from diverse accidents.[4]\nLong had a dysfunctional relationship with his mother; he slept in her bed until he was a teenager and reportedly resented her multiple short-term boyfriends she brought with her when returning home late at night from her job.[2] Long married his high school girlfriend in 1974, with whom he had two children before she filed for divorce in 1980.[5]\nLong committed at least 50[6] rapes as the \"Classified Ad Rapist\" in Fort Lauderdale, Ocala, Miami, and Dade County. Starting around 1981, Long began contacting women through the Penny Saver and other classified ads. When Long found a woman alone, he asked to use the bathroom, took out his \"rape kit\" and raped and robbed the woman. Long was tried and convicted for rape in 1981 but requested a new trial, which was granted. The charges were later dropped.[why?][7][8][unreliable source?]\nLong moved to the Tampa Bay area in 1983. In 1984, while on probation for assault, Long raped and strangled 20-year-old Artiss \"Ann\" Wick in March; her body was discovered in a rural area on November 22, 1984. She had reportedly hitch-hiked from Gas City, Indiana to Tampa, and was engaged to be married.[9]\nOver the next eight months, Long abducted, raped, and murdered at least 10 women in three counties in the Tampa Bay area (Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas). The investigation involved personnel from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office (HCSO), the FBI, the Tampa Police Department (TPD), the Pasco County Sheriff's Office (PCSO), and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE).[9]\nThe bodies of the victims were typically found in a state of decomposition long after the murders, having been dumped near a rural roadside or dragged into the woods. Long appears to have targeted vulnerable women, including abducting women walking alone and those working as sex workers, persuading women to enter his car where he would rape and torture them. Of Long's 10 known victims, five of the women were identified as known sex workers, two as exotic dancers. The remaining three victims were a factory worker, a student, and one with an unknown occupation.[10]\n",

Whitney died in a Florida prison, where he had been serving a life sentence, on April 24, 2005. At the time of his death, he had been incarcerated 44 years.\nWhitney spent the first years of his life in Victorville, California living with his parents. It is reported from a young age he got involved in criminal subcultures and wanted to dive into a life of robbery.\nOn February 12, 1960 Whitney entered a gas station in his home town of Victorville. After a brief holdup with an attendant named Jim Ryan, he shot the man to death and netted $30.[2] Whitney then progressed his way to Phoenix, Arizona, where on February 20, he shot to death 55-year-old Ira Lee Hardison and 40-year-old Spencer Frazier hours apart from one another.[1] Whitney stole Frazier's car and drove until it broke down the next day in Tucson.\nWith a broken down vehicle and stranded 470 miles away from home, Whitney resorted to another gas station robbery, which ended with 27-year-old Glen B. Smith being killed and Whitney pocketing $104.[2] With the money in hand Whitney was able to hitchhike his way across the country until he finally arrived in Miami, Florida on February 24. On February 28, Whitney killed 21-year-old Miami filling station operator Ken Mezzarno.\nThe next day, On February 29, Whitney killed gas station attendee 53-year-old Arthur Keeler after a brief holdup which netted him $50. On March 2, Whitney wounded 28-year-old filling station attended Jack Beecher, who got away. Beecher would later give a description of the robber. On March 4, Whitney adducted 62-year-old Virginia Selby from a parking lot. He drove her to an enclosed location where he bashed and shot her death with a claw hammer and his gun. Before the murder, it is believed that Shelby put up a fight with Whitney, that left Whitney with two gashes on his hands.[2]\nThe murders caused a great stir in the Miami public. Police quickly seized to question Jack Beecher, the only survivor of the killer. Beecher claimed the shooter was a young teen age looking red haired male, which matched Whitney's description. Whitney, who was already wanted for questioning for the killing of Virginia Shelby, was arrested on March 5. Whitney confessed to the murders, including the murders he committed in Arizona and California.[1]\nWhitney was charged with two murders, those being the ones of Arthur Keeler and Virginia Shelby. First spared of the death penalty for the murder of Shelby, On June 28, 1960, Whitney was sentenced to death for killing Keeler. After the verdict was announced at the sentencing, Whitney appeared dazed in his seat, and his defense attorneys later reveled to the public that they were surprised that the jury held up the verdict unanimously.[3]\nIn 1972, Whitney's sentences were reversed after Furman v. Georgia ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional, and he was resentenced to life imprisonment. On April 24, 2005 Whitney died in Union Correctional Facility from unspecified causes.[4] At the time of his death, he had been incarcerated 44 years, which at the time was one of the longest sentences to ever be served.\n",

        "paragraph": "The boycott of The Ingraham Angle was a boycott of companies that advertise their products during the controversial Fox News television show The Ingraham Angle. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student David Hogg initiated this boycott after the show's host, Laura Ingraham, ridiculed him amidst conspiracy theories related to the shooting at his school in 2018, in which seventeen students died and where Hogg was a witness and survivor.[1] Ingraham's particular criticism of Hogg was that some universities declined to offer him admission after his college application.[1]\nHogg accused Ingraham of cyberbullying and he suggested that his followers tell her show's sponsors to cancel their advertising purchases.[1] In response, several advertisers left the show after which Ingraham apologized.[1][2] Hogg dismissed the apology as insincere, and he and his supporters continued the pressure campaign on her show's advertisers.[3]\nMore than 20 sponsors have stopped advertising on the show. Public polling showed that public perception of Fox News declined more than that of any advertiser.[4] Advertising rates for the show declined slightly, and the amount of advertising during the show was reduced by as much as half.[5][6]\nThe boycott resulted in mixed reactions. Supporters of Ingraham's position included her employer Fox News,[7] musician Ted Nugent,[8] and Russian web brigades.[9][10] Bill Maher defended Ingraham on grounds of free speech, saying that the boycott was wrong.[11]  Back on the air after a week on a pre-planned vacation, Ingraham described the boycott as \"Stalinist\" and blamed leftists for working against free speech.[12] Hogg intensified the boycott in following months, further raising pressure on the show.[13][14] In 2020 S&P Global attributed a decline in Fox News advertising revenue to the boycott.[15]\nOn February 14, 2018, David Hogg survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in which a mass shooter killed seventeen people and wounded seventeen more. A few days after the shooting, Hogg and other shooting survivors founded Never Again MSD, a student group advocating for safety in school. On March 24, Never Again MSD was a lead organizer of March for Our Lives, a global student-led demonstration with some demands to change gun law in the United States. More than a million protestors attended more than 800 events around the world.\nDavid Hogg reported to his own social media which colleges had offered or declined admission to him.[16] On March 27, 2018, TMZ published an article listing all these schools.[16] The following day Fox News personality Laura Ingraham ridiculed Hogg, tweeting: \"David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance rates.)\"[17][18][19]  Hogg responded with a tweet that listed her advertisers, and suggested those advertisers be boycotted.[20][21]\nWithin two days, fifteen companies had ceased advertising on Ingraham's show, including AT&T, Office Depot and TripAdvisor. Other companies such as Ace Hardware dropped the show in the ensuing days.[22][23][24] A few days later, Allstate stopped advertising on Ingraham's show, circulating a memo to employees citing the company's values being at odds with Ingraham's comments.[25][26]\nIngraham publicly apologized for her remark within 25 and a half hours of her initial criticism,[27][28] but Hogg rejected it as insincere, saying she had only apologized because advertisers had left her show, and that he would accept an apology in the future if she denounced the way her network treated him and his friends.[29] Republican strategist Steve Schmidt speculated why Ingraham's advertisers pulled their support: \"...this kid's not scared. He's not scared of the NRA. He's not intimidated and scared by Laura Ingraham.\"[30]\nIngraham returned to her show in April after a pre-planned week-long Easter break, with the support of Rupert Murdoch.[31] According to The Washington Post, the advertising time dropped by half following the spat, but there was speculation that it might \"blow over\" with some advertisers returning to the show after the interest died down.[31] Fox News co-president Jack Abernethy said that the network \"cannot and will not allow voices to be censored by agenda-driven intimidation efforts\".[31]\n",

        "paragraph": "Charles McKay Wall (March 10, 1880 \u2013 April 18, 1955)[1] was an American businessman, mobster, and political figure who was a rival of reputed mobsters Santo Trafficante Sr. and Santo Trafficante Jr. His parents were John Perry Wall and Matilda McKay, a former Tampa Mayor and daughter of a former Tampa Mayor.  Wall rapidly gained status within the criminal underworld from his early endeavors in the operation of several gambling, prostitution, and illegal numbers rackets. He was killed, beaten with a baseball bat, and his throat slit, on April 18, 1955. He is buried in Tampa's Oaklawn Cemetery .[2]\nCharles McKay Wall was born on March 10, 1880 in Tampa, Florida to John Perry Wall, a local physician and former mayor of the city, and Matilta McKay, a member of the prominent McKay family. Due to the abuse he suffered at the hands of his stepmother, Wall developed mental health issues and eventually shot his stepmother, killing her. As a result, Wall was sent to military school, despite showing promise as a student. He was expelled from the school, due to visiting a brothel.\nThe young Charlie spent much of his formative years, frequenting the gambling dens of Tampa and, at some point, he took over the city's criminal and political underworld.[2]\nWall ran Tampa from the Ybor City neighborhood and employed Italians, Cubans and Irish into his organization.[2] His closest associate was Evaristo \"Tito\" Rubio, a Cuban mobster and co-owner of the El Dorado Club. Additionally, Wall was prominently involved in organized corruption of judges, politicians and other government officials, facing little opposition from the law or other criminals.[2]\nDuring the late 1920s, a turf war began between Wall and Ignacio Antinori. They fought each other, as well as the Trafficante's, for control of the numbers rackets in the Tampa area.[2]\nBy the 1930s, Ignacio Antinori and Charlie Wall were in a bloody war for ten years, which would later be known as \"Era of Blood\".[2] Eddie Virella, Rubio's former partner at the Lincoln Club, was gunned down on 31 January 1937, and Rubio himself was killed by a gunman while on the porch of his home on March 8, 1938. [2]\nThe feud between Wall and Antinori came to a head between factions of Antinori Gang, dissatisfied members of Chicago and St. Louis criminal outfits to whom Antinori was supplying narcotics, and Wall's organisation. On the morning of October 23, 1940, Antinori was shot dead at a local restaurant while sipping his morning coffee by two gunmen. Wall himself had seen an attempt on his life go awry earlier that spring, possibly by some members of Antinori's outfit or even by some in Antinori's ties to St. Louis mobster Thomas Buffa and/or Kansas City mobsters Nicolo Impostato, James DeSimone and Joseph Deluca.[2]\nWall was murdered on April 18, 1955, possibly on orders from the Trafficante's.[2]\nThe account and rise and fall of Wall was depicted in the 2008 documentary film The Ghosts of Ybor: Charlie Wall which starred actors John A. Schakel as Wall, Gene Siudut as Joe Bedami, Chris Pardal as Johnny \"Scarface\" Rivera, and Rod Grant as the lead detective in the Wall murder investigation.\n",

She survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018 and after became a co-founder of March for Our Lives and advocates against gun violence. She is the younger sister of former Marjory Stoneman Douglas student David Hogg.\nHogg was born on June 10, 2003,[1] and is the daughter of Kevin Hogg, a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,[2] and Rebecca Boldrick, born in San Diego County, California[3] and a teacher for Broward County Public Schools in Broward County, Florida.[4] She is also the younger sister of David Hogg, both graduating from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018 and 2021, respectively.[5] Hogg and her family moved to Washington, D.C. after her graduation in 2021.[6]\nOn February 14, 2018, Hogg was a freshman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when a 19-year-old former student of the school entered the campus and started shooting with a semi-automatic rifle. Hogg was in a television production class when the shooting started; the fire alarm was activated and she believed it was possibly a prank because they had had a fire alarm drill earlier in the day.[7] When Hogg and other students were in the stairwell after evacuating due to the alarm, she realized that it was not a prank after she saw students running out of the building.[7] She went back to her classroom and unlocked a closet in the room and hid with other students.[8] Hogg reunited with her brother and father later that day.[9] Her friends Jaime Guttenburg,   Alaina Petty,   Alyssa Alhadeff, and Gina Montalto were killed in the shooting.[4]\nAfter the shooting, Hogg became an activist against gun rights in the United States and became a co-founder of the March for Our Lives protests.[10] She co-authored a book with her brother, David Hogg, called #NeverAgain: A New Generation Draws the Line published by Random House.[11]\nHogg testified as a witness before the United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Recovery in September 2019, following new legislation in the United States Senate that addressed school safety.[10] Before the hearing, she spoke at a rally against gun rights alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.[10] Speaking to members of the subcommittee, Hogg said, \"I think if we did enough, I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have lost my friends.\"[12] She also told members that lawmakers need to take steps including hiring mental health professionals to provide grief counseling to students and provide security in schools, in opposition to Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis signing a bill into law allowing public school districts to arm teachers.[12]\nIn 2019 Hogg wrote Activist, a graphic novel.[11]\nHogg describes herself as liberal and supports raising the purchase age of firearms from 18 to 21, because the shooter of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting was 19 years old and purchased the gun legally.[13]\n",

The incident was reviewed by the Department of Justice for potential civil rights violations, but no additional charges were filed, citing insufficient evidence.\nTrayvon Benjamin Martin was the son of Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who were divorced in 1999. He was a junior at Dr. Michael M. Krop High School and lived with his mother and older brother in Miami Gardens, Florida.[7][8][9] On the day he was fatally shot, he and his father were visiting his father's fianc\u00e9e and her son at her town home in Sanford, Florida. She lived in The Retreat at Twin Lakes, a gated community Martin had visited several times before.[10][11][12]\nAccording to his autopsy, Martin was 5\u00a0feet 11\u00a0inches (1.80\u00a0m) tall and weighed 158 pounds (72\u00a0kg) at the time of his death.[13]\nGeorge Michael Zimmerman was born in Manassas, Virginia[14] and is the son of Gladys (n\u00e9e Mesa) Zimmerman, born in Peru,[2] and Robert Zimmerman Sr., a retired Virginia magistrate.[15] At the time of the shooting, Zimmerman was employed as an insurance fraud investigator.[2] He had been working toward an associate degree in criminal justice at Seminole State College.[16] In one of his interviews with the police, he said his goal was to become a judge.[17]\nAt the time of his arrest on April 11, 2012, Zimmerman's height was reportedly 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) and his weight 185 lb (84 kg), according to the Seminole County Sheriff's Office Inmate Booking record.[18] Zimmerman's height was shown as 5 feet 8 inches (1.73 m) and his weight at 200 lb (91 kg) on the Sanford Police Department Offense Report for February 26, 2012, the night of the shooting.[19]\nZimmerman and his wife moved to The Retreat at Twin Lakes in 2009.[10][20]\n",

The group had intended to travel to Canada, but first drove to California, where Kimyala obtained her birth certificate.\nTwo weeks later, Mayer and Ohering were found dead in a murder\u2013suicide at a rest area in Collier County, Florida. Eight days later, Kimyala Henson's body was discovered in a rural area near Pyramid Lake in Nevada; she had been bludgeoned with a hatchet and shot to death. Mayer and Oehring were assumed responsible for Kimyala's murder, and evidence showed that Mayer had assumed Henson's identity, and that she and Oehring had used Kimyala's credit cards to purchase gasoline and food. According to subsequent reports, Oehring allegedly led a Satanist group in Stewartsville, Missouri, of which Mayer was a member.\nDespite widespread searches, neither Shaina Kirkpatrick nor Shausha Henson were located, and as of 2022, their whereabouts remain unknown.\nThe siblings, Shaina Kirkpatrick (age 3) and Shausha Henson (age approximately 2 months) departed on a road trip from their home in Portland, Oregon, with their mother, Kimyala Henson. Kimyala was accompanied by her childhood friend,[6] Christina Noel Mayer, and Frank Lee Oehring, a fugitive from Stewartsville, Missouri wanted by police after the attempted murder of his ex-wife.[7] Mayer introduced Oehring to Kimyala as her husband, using the pseudonym of Curtis. Oehring reportedly led a Satanist group in Missouri, of which Mayer was an alleged member.[8]\nMayer and Oehring had made a surprise visit to the Portland area on approximately April 2, 2001, claiming they were scouting locations with the intent to possibly move there.[7] Mayer was able to contact Kimyala using a phone book.[7] The former childhood friends spent a week together before Oehring offered to take Mayer, Kimyala, and her daughters on a vacation to British Columbia, Canada, an invitation Kimyala accepted.[7]\nKimyala and her daughters were last seen at a hotel in Redding, California on April 5, 2001, accompanied by Mayer and Oehring. Earlier that day, the group had stopped in Sacramento to obtain Kimyala's birth certificate, as it is believed Mayer and Oehring convinced her she would need the document to enter Canada.[7] Two days after the group had embarked on their road trip, Kimyala's mother died in Portland; when family members attempted to contact her by phone to notify her of the news, they were unable to reach her.[7]\nOn April 20, 2001, an off-duty deputy found Mayer shot to death with a .22 caliber rifle in an apparent murder\u2013suicide beside a picnic table at a rest area in Collier County, Florida.[6][7] Oehring, who had shot himself in the head nearby, was still alive. He was flighted to Lee Memorial Hospital in Naples, where he died later that day.[9] In a garbage can at the rest area, Kimyala's birth certificate was discovered by authorities, torn in half.[6] Further investigation yielded that Kimyala's credit cards had been used to purchase gasoline and food through numerous states between April 6 and April 9, 2001, and that Mayer had fraudulently obtained a Nevada state identification card using Kimyala's identity.[6] The Kia Sephia that the group had traveled in was left parked at the rest area; inside the car, a diaper bag was found, but no other evidence of the missing children could be located.[6]\nOn April 28, 2001, eight days after the discovery of Mayer and Oehring, Kimyala Henson's body was found partially buried near Pyramid Lake, approximately 37 miles (60\u00a0km) north of Wadsworth, Nevada.[8][6] She had been bludgeoned with a hatchet and shot to death. Ballistics analysis concluded that Kimyala had been shot with the same gun used in Mayer and Oehring's murder\u2013suicide.[10]\nAs of 2022[update], the whereabouts of Kirkpatrick and Henson remain unknown.\n",

The murder has been alleged to be in connection with the sale of his company, SunCruz Casinos.[1]\nBoulis was born in Kavala, a city in northern Greece. During his childhood, he was known as \"Kostas\". Each day after finishing school, he would run to the shore to wait for his father's boat. His father was a fisherman, and he was the third of four children. Boulis wanted to move away from his home country as he found it difficult to deal with the death of his brother Panagiotis \"Peter\" Boulis, who was fatally electrocuted in an accident. He took classes in ship mechanics at age 16, to prepare himself with skills necessary for a future in the United States. In July 1971, while at a dry-cleaning store, he met the sixteen year old receptionist Efrosini \"Frances\" Boulis, who also originated from Kavala. The day that they met, Boulis was detained as an illegal migrant. One week later, they were married. Their marriage automatically granted Boulis a Canadian citizenship. Within the space of four years from their marriage, they had raised two sons; Christos and Panagiotis.[2] Frances stayed in Greece raising their two sons while Boulis developed his multiple businesses and holding companies in North America.[2] Within days of arriving in Florida, Gus Boulis had met Margaret Hren, an 18-year-old employee originating from Minnesota. Hren agreed to assist Boulis in launching a restaurant business after obtaining a $50,000 loan from a Canadian bank. The couple renovated a dilapidated restaurant in Key West. Two years later, Boulis constructed his first hotel, the \"Marriott Key Largo Beach Resort\" obtaining the startup funds from a $2.5 million overdraft from a local bank.[3] Eventually Boulis and Hren had two sons. Frances remained in Greece and filed for a divorce and half of his assets.[4] Boulis was known for being a tireless hard worker who did whatever it takes to drive his many businesses to success and perfection. He usually wore polo or dress shirts, jeans, or tuxedos. Boulis enjoyed soccer, supporting the Olympiacos FC fanatically, and travelling in his private jet to attend their games. He stood at 174\u00a0cm, had blonde hair and blue eyes. Gus Boulis was known by the local Greek community as a generous and caring person, always willing to help out anybody in need with loans or business ventures.[2] Over 300 people attended his funeral, at the St George Greek Orthodox Church in Hollywood. Attendees were seen crying in the masses, and kissing his face. Many positive speeches and comments about Gus Boulis were made. Mayor Mara Giulianti attended his funeral as well.[5]\nBoulis was born in a fishing village of Kavala in Macedonia. He stayed in school only until the sixth grade to work as a fisherman and then trained as a mechanic.[6] Upon leaving school, he went to work for his father. Boulis joined the merchant marines in 1968 against his father's wishes. He would later jump ship in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, to avoid compulsory military service before moving off to Toronto, Ontario.[7] Boulis started off as a fisherman before taking a job as a dishwasher at a Mr. Submarine sandwich chain. The original owners of Mr. Submarine, now known as Mr. Sub, were Jack Levinson and Earl Linzon. It was Gus Boulis who showed Levinson and Linzon how to franchise. He soon was offered control of one of the stores, and shares in the corporation.[8][9] In his five years with the company Boulis developed a chain of over 200 stores. The sale of the Boulis's shares in the company in the mid-1970s made Boulis a multimillionaire at 25.\nIn 1979, Boulis moved to Florida with the intent to retire, however he soon began building the popular Miami Subs Grill.[10] He continued his success in food business, expanding the Miami Subs chain throughout Florida and beyond. In May 1994, Boulis bought a legendary mafia restaurant in Hollywood Florida, the Joe Sonken's Gold Coast Restaurant and Lounge, and flipped it into a Miami Subs Grill.[11] He sold the Miami Subs Grill chain to Nathan's Famous hot dog chain in 1999 for $4.2 million.[12][13]\nIn 1994, Gus Boulis took 300 of his Miami Subs Grill employees aboard a Las Vegas-style gambling ship for a party. This experience inspired him to purchase the \"Sir Winston\" for $2 million only a few days later, a 100-foot cruise ship which he rapidly converted into a casino ship. It was this that based the grounds for his new venture, which would ultimately result in his death.\nBoulis founded the SunCruz Casinos boat company in 1994 in Key Largo. It was a cruise line with \"cruises to nowhere\" as the passengers would gamble on the voyage as the ships would travel out onto international water, where Florida gambling laws were not applicable.[7] Boulis' largest and most profitable gambling boat, was docked on the Intracoastal Waterway in Hollywood, Florida, where he had the support of mayor Mara Giulianti. However, Hollywood community beach activists, led by City Commissioner John F. Coleman, strongly opposed the gambling boat operation. The sheriff of the area, Ken Jenne, worked repeatedly with attorney general Bob Butterworth to end operations of the company as they strongly opposed it. On one instance in 1998, the pair shut down three SunCruz boats, and showed up to the SunCruz V with police forces and seized over 300 gambling machines, ship equipment and nearly $630,000 in cash, after undercover officers completed a nine-month investigation to catch SunCruz practising gambling within the three-mile limit. This was fought in court, to which SunCruz won the case because there was no probable cause for the State Attorney General's Office to seize the equipment and money.  Mayor Mara Giulianti lobbied to have Boulis finance and build the \"Diamond on the Beach\"  beach hotel, a deal that ultimately fell through. His business drew opposition from other Florida government officials regarding questions on when Boulis attained his American citizenship. The government alleged he purchased some of his SunCruz gambling boats before he became a US citizen. In February 2000, Boulis settled with Federal authorities by agreeing to sell his interest in the SunCruz business within three years and pay a $500,000 fine.[8] According to the Broward Palm Beach New Times, Gus Boulis had also registered his casino boats under his former girlfriend's name, Margaret Hren, to hide his ownership.[4]\nIn September 2000, Boulis had agreed to sell SunCruz to Jack Abramoff and Adam Kidan for $147.5 million. In the deal Boulis kept a silent ten percent interest, accepting a $20 million promissory note in lieu of the $23 million cash down payment. This transaction later went on to be the focus of a grand jury inquiry.[9][14]\nOn August 11, 2005, Abramoff and Kidan were indicted by a federal grand jury in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on fraud charges relating to the disputed $23 million bank transfer used as down payment for the purchase of SunCruz Casinos. Kidan pleaded guilty on December 15, 2005,[15] Abramoff pleaded guilty on January 3, 2006.[16]\nThree men were charged with the 2001 murder of Boulis:\n",

He was a member of a loose-knit gang of teenagers from Murray, Kentucky, known as the \"Vampire Clan\". Ferrell claimed to be a 500-year-old vampire named Vesago, a character he created for himself after becoming obsessed with the role playing game Vampire: The Masquerade. It was his mother, Sondra Gibson who first introduced this game to Rod.[1] In 1998, Ferrell pleaded guilty to the double slaying of a couple from Eustis, Florida, becoming the youngest person in Florida on Death Row at that time.[2] Originally sentenced to death, Ferrell's penalty has since been reduced to life imprisonment.\nOn November 25, 1996, Naomi Ruth Queen and Richard Wendorf were found by their daughter Jennifer Wendorf, beaten to death in their Eustis home.[3]  While 49-year-old Richard Wendorf was asleep on his couch and Ruth was in the shower, Ferrell and accomplice Howard Scott Anderson had entered the home through the unlocked garage, picking up the murder weapon, a crowbar.\nBefore Richard had even awakened, Ferrell beat him multiple times with it, fracturing both his skull and ribs, almost instantly knocking him out, and killing him shortly thereafter. When Ruth had found Ferrell and Anderson in the home moments later, Ferrell bludgeoned her to death, bashing her head with the crowbar. He claimed in his confession, however, that in his original plan he was going to allow Naomi Ruth to live, but she first attacked him by lunging at him and throwing a very hot cup of coffee on him, which angered him and made him change his mind and so he killed her also.[2]\nRichard had burn marks in the shape of a V. It was said that the V was Ferrell's symbol, which he accompanied with a dot for each person he considered to be in his vampire cult.\nThe victims were the parents of Heather Wendorf, a long-time friend of Rod's whom he was helping to run away from a home that she described as \"hell\". Heather and the other girls that were with Ferrell and Anderson were not at the Wendorf home when the murders took place. Charity Keesee and her friend Dana Cooper had driven Heather to her boyfriend's apartment so Heather could say good-bye before leaving for New Orleans, leaving Roderrick and Scott outside the Wendorf home.\nAfter four days of driving through four states, the group was found in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.[3]  It is believed that Ferrell liked a video arcade in New Orleans, and they were headed there. One of the girls, Charity Keesee, placed a call to her grandmother in South Dakota. The group needed money, and Charity thought her grandmother could help them. However, Keesee's grandmother informed the police about her whereabouts and helped them trick Ferrell, Wendorf, and the rest of the teens into going to a local Howard Johnson's hotel, where they were arrested by waiting law enforcement. The four were held at a Baton Rouge jail for a week before being extradited back to Florida, where they were initially booked at the Lake County Jail. They were later moved to a juvenile facility in Ocala.\nOn February 12, 1998, then-seventeen-year-old Ferrell pleaded guilty to the murders, claiming that the others traveling with him were innocent except Scott Anderson, who was simply an accessory. Ferrell pleaded guilty to two counts of felony murder. \nFerrell's attorneys tried to argue that he was insane; he has been diagnosed with mental disorders including schizotypal personality disorder[4] and Asperger syndrome.[5] The University of Florida further attested that Rod could sometimes witness spiritual things, like angels and demons.[4]\nJudge Jerry T. Lockett sentenced Ferrell to death. Charity Keesee was convicted of two counts of third-degree murder, robbery with a gun or deadly weapon and burglary armed with a weapon or explosives. She was sentenced to 10.5 years in state prison. Dana Cooper was convicted of those charges as well, but was given a 17.5 year prison sentence. Anderson was convicted of the same charges as Ferrell and was sentenced to life in prison. \n",

        "paragraph": "\nLawrence Bernard \"Larry\" Singleton (July 28, 1927 \u2013 December 28, 2001), nicknamed the \"Mad Chopper\" in media accounts, was an American criminal known for perpetrating an infamous rape and mutilation of adolescent hitchhiker Mary Vincent in California in 1978, and then perpetrating a second attack on a woman shortly after being released from prison eight years later. He raped Vincent and cut off her arms, then left her to die in a culvert off of Interstate 5 in Del Puerto Canyon. Vincent managed to hike to safety and later acted as a key witness against the rapist. Released from prison on good behavior after serving eight years of his fourteen-year sentence, Singleton later murdered Roxanne Hayes, a mother of three. On February 19, 1997, police found him covered in blood after stabbing her in his new home.\nLawrence Singleton was born in Tampa, Florida.[2] He worked as a merchant seaman.[3]\nOn September 29, 1978, Singleton picked up 15-year-old Mary Vincent of Las Vegas, Nevada, while she was hitchhiking from her grandfather's house in Berkeley, California back home to Las Vegas. He picked her up outside of Modesto, California, after which he knocked her unconscious with a sledgehammer, spent the whole night raping her, and tortured her by severing both her forearms with a hatchet. Singleton figured she was dead or near death and he threw her off of a 30-foot cliff on Interstate-5 near Del Puerto Canyon, leaving her naked and bleeding out. She mitigated the bleeding from her forearms by shoving them into mud, and the mud suppressed her bleeding while she managed to pull herself back up the cliff. She walked for three miles, naked, covered in blood, and armless, before finding and alerting a passing couple, who took her to a hospital. By the time of Singleton's arrest, Vincent wore prosthetic arms.[4]\nSix months after the assault, Vincent faced Singleton at his trial, where her testimony helped to convict him.[5] Singleton was sentenced to fourteen years in prison, the maximum allowed by law in California at that time.[5] The presiding judge remarked: \"If I had the power, I would send him to prison for the rest of his natural life.\"[6]\nWhile Vincent won a $2.56\u00a0million civil judgment against Singleton, she was unable to collect it when Singleton revealed that he was unemployed, in poor health, and had only $200 in savings.[7]\nAlong with the particularly gruesome and callous aspects of the crime, the case became even more notorious after Singleton was paroled after serving only eight years in prison. He was able to reduce his time through good behavior and working as a teaching assistant in a prison classroom.[6] Singleton was paroled to Contra Costa County, California, but no town would accept his presence, so he had to live in a trailer on the grounds of San Quentin prison until his parole ended a year later.[2]\nAccording to Time magazine, \"as authorities attempted to settle him in one Bay Area town after another, angry crowds and Tampa's chapter of Guardian Angels led protests, screamed, picketed and eventually prevailed.\"[8] In Rodeo, about 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, a crowd of approximately 500 local protestors forced officers to move him under armed guard from a hotel room. Authorities tried housing him across the street from Concord's City Hall, but that was met with protests and failed too.[9]  He was removed from one apartment in Contra Costa County in a bullet-proof vest after 400 residents surrounded the building to protest a decision to place him there permanently.[10] Governor George Deukmejian ordered that Singleton be placed in a trailer on the grounds of San Quentin for the duration of his one-year parole.\nThe outrage at this sentence resulted in legislation, supported by Mary Vincent, which prevents the early release of offenders who have committed a crime in which torture is used: in 1987 Singleton's parole led to passage of California's \"Singleton bill\", which carries a 25-years-to-life sentence. (Harrower, 1998). The leniency of the legal system shocked and outraged many. One journalist who interviewed him remarked, \"What was most surprising to me, however, was not his sentence. It was that Larry Singleton had worked his crimes around in his mind so completely that they did not warrant punishment at all.\"[11] Right before Singleton's parole ended, Donald Stahl, the Stanislaus County prosecutor at Singleton's trial, said, \"I think, if anything, he's worse now. He has not taken responsibility. He lives in a bizarre fantasy land and acquits himself each day. He doesn't accept his guilt and won't resolve never to do it again.\"[12]\n",

He is sometimes referred to as The I-95 Killer since most of his victims lived close to the Interstate 95 highway.[2][3]\nBowles was born in Clifton Forge, Virginia, and was raised in Rupert, West Virginia.[4] His father Frank, who worked as a coal miner, had died from black lung disease six months before, and his mother Frances remarried several times. Bowles was abused by his second stepfather, a violent alcoholic who also abused Bowles' mother and older brother.[5]:\u200a2\u200a The abuse continued until, at the age of 13, Bowles fought back and severely injured his stepfather. He left home soon thereafter, angered by his mother's decision to remain in the marriage.[5]:\u200a2\u200a He was homeless for the next few years, earning money as a prostitute to men.[5]:\u200a2\u200a\nIn 1982, he was arrested for beating and sexually assaulting his girlfriend, and was sentenced to six years in prison. In 1991, after his release from prison, he was convicted of unarmed robbery in the theft of an elderly woman's purse, a crime for which he was sentenced to four more years in prison; he was released in two.[6]\nOn March 15, 1994, in Daytona Beach, Florida, Bowles killed his first known victim, John Hardy Roberts, age 59, who had offered him a temporary place to live. Bowles beat and strangled him to death, and then stole his credit card which he later used in Kingsland, Georgia and Nashville, Tennessee.[4] Police soon considered him a suspect after finding his fingerprints and probation records at the crime scene.[5]:\u200a4\u200a\nOver the next six months, Bowles murdered four other men:[7] 39 year old David Jarman in Wheaton, Maryland; 72 year old Milton Bradley in Savannah, Georgia; 47 year old Alverson Carter Jr. in Atlanta, Georgia; and 38 year old Albert Morris in Hilliard, Florida.[8] His typical modus operandi was to prostitute himself to his victims before beating and strangling them, and stealing their credit cards. \nWhile on the run, Bowles was put on the FBI's list of the country's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives for his four known victims.[9] On November 22, 1994, Bowles was arrested for the murder of Walter Jamelle \"Jay\" Hinton in Jacksonville Beach, Florida, and confessed to all six murders.[5]\nFollowing his arrest for the murders, Bowles told police that following his 1991 release from prison he had moved to Daytona Beach, and moved in with a girlfriend and resumed working as a prostitute. According to Bowles, his girlfriend became pregnant but then had an abortion after she learned that Bowles was a sex worker. Bowles told police officers that he blamed gay men for the abortion, and this led him to becoming a murderer.[7]\nIn May 1996, Bowles pleaded guilty to the killing of Walter Jamelle Hinton in Jacksonville on November 17, 1994. Hinton died after Bowles hit his head with a 40-pound (18\u00a0kg) stepping stone while Hinton was sleeping and stuffed a towel down his throat during the struggle. Bowles received the death penalty for Hinton's murder.[10] In August 1997, while sitting on death row for the slaying of Hinton, Bowles pleaded guilty to beating and strangling Roberts in 1994.[10]\n",

Johnson overpowered two of his co-workers and left them handcuffed in different locations. He stashed most of the $18.8 million in a storage shed in Mountain Home, North Carolina, and moved to Mexico City.\nOn August 30, 1997, a U.S. Customs Agent at a border crossing from Mexico pulled a passenger from a bus bound for Houston, Texas, suspicious of his responses to her questions. Upon further investigation the agent found the identification offered by the passenger to be a known alias for Johnson, and he was arrested when multiple passports were found in his possession.\nIndependent of Johnson's apprehension, investigators were already following a trail of clues that led to the North Carolina storage shed on September 18, 1997. Approximately $18 million was recovered from the shed. Johnson was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.\nJohnson was released from prison October 3, 2019.[3]\n\nThe robbery was featured in an episode of Daring Capers.\n",

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

The group gained notoriety for a crime spree that ended on April 30, 1996, with the murder of one of the boys' teachers, Mark Schwebes, the Riverdale High School's band director.\nThe case has been documented, most extensively in Jim Greenhill's true crime book about the case, Someone Has to Die Tonight. It is also the subject of a Dateline NBC special, When A Killer Calls,[2] as well as being mentioned in Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground by Michael Moynihan & Didrik S\u00f8derlind, the book even borrowing the group's name.\nOn April 12, 1996, in Fort Myers, Florida, Kevin Foster, Pete Magnotti, and Chris Black went on a vandalism and arson spree.[2] Florida juvenile records show that only the group's ringleader, Kevin Foster, had any prior arrests or criminal history, and his record primarily consisted of driving violations. The first spree was quickly followed by a second that included an attempt to burn a church bus and the burning of a bird cage containing two macaws, killing one.\nAfter the night of destruction, Foster decided they should form a militia dedicated to terrorizing the community. The creation of the group's symbol ( (\u00d8) ) came from an in-joke involving a question Foster missed on a math test. The symbol for the null or empty set is either { } or \u00d8. On the test, Foster wrote ( \u00d8 ) as the answer to a question whose answer was not set, marking it incorrect.\nKevin \"God\" Foster, Pete \"Fried\" Magnotti, Chris \"Slim\" Black, and Derek \"Mob\" Shields made up the core members of the Lords of Chaos. The group also included lesser associates, Chris \"Red\" Burnett, Thomas \"Dog\" Torrone, Brad Young, and Craig Lesh.\nIn an East Lee Tribune article titled \"Hell Raising in Buckingham,\" a local reporter lashed out at the unknown culprits, calling them \"obviously pea-brained vandals\" and \"person(s) of less than average intelligence and a cretin's personality.\"[3]:\u200a102\u200a This article only further antagonized the boys.\nOn April 17, the group wrote a document entitled \"Declaration of War \u2014 Formal Introduction of Lords of Chaos,\" which they planned to mail to the Lee County Clerk/Traffic Violations Bureau but ultimately did not. The manifesto warned:\nLee County is dealing with a formidable foe, with high caliber intelligence, balls of titanium alloy, and a wicked, destructive streak. . .

On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nStanley Everett Rice (August 7, 1942 \u2013 November 3, 2007) was an American serial killer and child rapist who was responsible for sexually abusing numerous underage boys in Canada and the U.S. during the 1960s, of which he killed at least three. Tried and convicted for one murder committed in Florida, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and remained incarcerated until his death in 2007.\nStanley Everett Rice was born on August 7, 1942, in Concord, Massachusetts, the younger of two children. He was raised in a dysfunctional home with abusive parents, but was nonetheless close to his elder sister. According to acquaintances, Rice was considered a nervous, quiet boy who was very polite to those around him, and whom stuttered when he was under pressure or excited. Unbeknownst to most, however, he started to exhibit strange behavior since the age of five, when he started burning newspapers in the family cellar.[1] Just a month after this incident, Rice proceeded to light a fire under an oil tank in that same cellar, and for the following years, he would start stealing various from family members.[1]\nIn an attempt to cure him of his apparent fear of loud noises, Rice's father started firing guns in his presence, which seemingly helped the boy overcome it. Not long after, Rice developed a fascination with firearms, and would start stealing ammo from shops to fire it.[1] At the same time, his continued to commit various acts of vandalism and thefts, receiving his first court date at age 11 for stealing ammo, for which he was put on probation. In February 1955, he was kicked out of a private school in Staatsburg, New York for vandalism, and would continue to commit similar crimes for the following years. In 1959, he was convicted of stealing an automobile and detained at a juvenile correctional facility for six months.[2][1]\nAccording to later interviews, Rice's first sexual experience occurred at age nine, when he was molested by an older man at a barn near a railroad crossing.[1] In the summer of 1955, while at the Lyman School for Boys, he wrote in his diary that he was forced to engage in sexual acts with other boys, and that was when he started to exhibit odd sexual behavior. Over the next few years, he started developing a sexual fascination with blood and seeing young boys defecate, but restrained himself from inflicting harm on others. He would write down his thoughts and feelings about this in his personal diary, which he had kept since he was a young boy.[1]\nIn March 1957, Rice and his parents moved to Nichol Township, a small township near the Kitchener-Waterloo area of Ontario, Canada, where he attended the Kitchener-Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School.[3] During his period, he developed a fascination with rockets and bombs, and would continued to get in trouble with law enforcement for a variety of crimes. In one of his prison stints, Rice wrote that he had convinced a fellow inmate to hang himself by claiming that a friend of his was planning to kill him. After his release on November 28, 1961, he would avoid trouble with the police most of the time, but Rice would also begin his attempts to sexually molest young boys.[4]\nOn July 12, 1963, nine-year-old Keith Henry was reported missing from his home in Waterloo, Ontario. His disappearance led to a large-scale investigation of the nearby area by both local authorities and volunteers, but the searches turned up nothing.[5] The searches were eventually discontinued, and a $1,000 reward was announced for anyone who could provide information about his whereabouts.[6] Henry's mother even requested help from purported clairvoyants, but the boy's body was never found.[7]\nRice would write in his diary that he came across Henry while he was fishing, and that he stabbed him to death using a hunting knife, appearing seemingly aroused by the sight of the blood splatters.[4] He then buried the body in an overgrown area on the riverbank of the Grand River, but was unable to remember where exactly. Later that September, Rice was arrested after abducting a young boy and driving him to Swansea, Illinois, but the Canadian authorities agreed to have the charges dropped if he and his family left the country. After doing so, he moved to Sandusky, Ohio, where he found a job at an amusement park.[4]\nAfter working at the park for some time, Rice gathered enough money to buy himself a car and go on a trip across the country before returning to his family's new home in Auburndale, Massachusetts.[4] Just eleven days later, on September 29, he was arrested for having unlicensed weaponry in his car and detained at the Metropolitan State Hospital. During his stay, he was diagnosed as a schizophrenic with a sociopathic personality, but was reported to be a cooperative patient who did not pester the employees. After serving a six-month sentence at the Billerica House of Corrections, he was released and continued to travel cross-country.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "Abraham Lee Shakespeare (April 24, 1966 \u2013 c.\u2009April 7, 2009) was a casual laborer from the US who won a $30 million lottery jackpot in Florida, receiving $17 million in 2006. In 2009, his family declared him missing, and in January 2010 his body was found buried under a concrete slab in the backyard of an acquaintance. Dorice \"Dee Dee\" Moore was convicted of his murder and is now serving life in prison without the possibility of parole.[1]\nThe Florida Lotto winning ticket worth thirty million dollars was sold at a Town Star convenience store in Frostproof, Florida, on November 15, 2006.[2] On that day, Abraham Lee Shakespeare and co-worker Michael Ford were headed toward Miami when they stopped briefly at the convenience store in Frostproof to buy drinks and cigarettes. Ford got out of the truck and asked Shakespeare if he wanted a soda. Shakespeare instead asked Ford to buy him two lottery tickets. Shakespeare said that he paid Ford $2 for the tickets out of the $5 he had on him that day.[3]\nFord later approached Shakespeare demanding a share of the jackpot of no less than $1 million, which Shakespeare refused to pay, prompting Ford to sue Shakespeare and alleging that Shakespeare stole lottery tickets out of Ford's wallet.[3] The jury did not believe Ford's stolen lottery tickets story and Shakespeare prevailed in the courts. Shakespeare had chosen a one-time, lump sum cash payment of $17 million.[4] He moved out of his working-class neighborhood in Lakeland, Florida and into a gated community.[5] Several months after his lottery win, apart from a $1 million home, his only other major purchases included a Nissan Altima and a Rolex watch from a pawnshop.[6] By late January 2010 the sheriff involved in the investigation of Shakespeare's disappearance told AP that the lottery money \"is gone now.\"[7]\nFriends stated Shakespeare had grown frustrated with the apparently constant appeals for money from both hangers-on and strangers. He told his brother, \"I'd have been better off broke,\" and told a childhood friend, \"I thought all these people were my friends, but then I realized all they want is just money.\"[1] One of these was Dorice Donegan \"Dee-Dee\" Moore, who launched a business with Shakespeare, Abraham Shakespeare LLC, giving herself control of the firm's funds. Moore subsequently withdrew $1 million and bought herself a Hummer, a Chevrolet Corvette and a truck before going on vacation. She later claimed that the money was a gift from Shakespeare.[5]\nOn November 9, 2009, Shakespeare's family reported him missing, stating that they had not seen him since April of that year. Family and friends had originally hoped that he had taken his money and was living on a beach in the Caribbean Sea. A tip-off led investigators to the backyard of a home purchased by Moore, where Shakespeare's body was found buried under 9 feet (2.7\u00a0m) of dirt under a newly constructed concrete slab.[1] Shakespeare was 42.[5]\nHillsborough County detectives say Shakespeare died April 6 or 7 in the single-story ranch home in Plant City.[8]  Police took Moore into custody on February 2, 2010, in connection with the murder of Shakespeare. A judge set a $1 million bond. The police stated Moore had tried to convince an acquaintance to unearth the body and move it a week after the death, and had continued to try to convince others that Shakespeare was still alive.[9] On February 19, 2010, Moore was formally charged with first degree murder.\nDorice Donegan \"Dee Dee\" Moore (born July 25, 1972) was the prime suspect in the death of Abraham Shakespeare. She was married to James Moore in 1992, and has a son born in 1995. In 2001, Moore was convicted of insurance fraud[10] and falsely reporting a crime; she served a year of probation. Moore filed for bankruptcy in 2002.\nBefore police found Shakespeare's body, Moore said Shakespeare had decided to leave town and had gone to Texas, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, or Orlando, Florida, or was sick in a hospital. Moore also said that Shakespeare was tired of people asking him for money, so she helped him leave town.[5] After police found his body under a concrete slab, in the backyard of the home she put in her boyfriend's name, Moore told police different versions of what happened to Shakespeare. Moore in turn blamed drug dealers, a lawyer and her 14-year-old son.[11] She later said she killed Shakespeare in self-defence.[9] Soon after the disappearance of Shakespeare, Moore, who was living in Shakespeare's house, kept using his cell phone and sending text messages to his friends and relatives, pretending she was Shakespeare. Recipients thought they did not sound like him and were suspicious because Shakespeare was illiterate.[5][11] When people texted Shakespeare's phone back with questions that could not be answered by Moore, no response was given.[11]\nDuring the same time that Moore was trying to make it appear as though Shakespeare was alive, she tried to find a person who would take the blame for Shakespeare's death for fifty thousand dollars. She also offered to pay someone to dig up and move Shakespeare's body to another location.[12] Property records show that Moore's company, American Medical Professionals, bought Shakespeare's house.[1] Moore told investigators she paid Shakespeare $655,000 for his home and paid $185,000 for outstanding loans (which were actually worth much more) to others; however, there is no evidence showing she paid Shakespeare anything.[5] Moore offered the mother of one of Shakespeare's two sons a $200,000 home if she would lie to detectives and tell them she had seen him recently. She also paid $5,000 to a relative of Shakespeare's to give his mother a birthday card and imply it was from him.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nNever Again MSD is an American student-led political action committee for gun control that advocates for tighter regulations to prevent gun violence.[1] The organization, also known by the Twitter hashtags #NeverAgain, and #EnoughIsEnough, was formed by a group of twenty students attending Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSD) at the time of the deadly shooting in 2018, in which seventeen students and staff members were killed by the alleged gunman, who was a 19-year-old former student of the school and was armed with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle. The organization started on social media as a movement \"for survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting\" using the hashtag #NeverAgain.[2] A main goal of the group was to influence that year's United States mid-term elections,[3] and they embarked on a multi-city bus tour to encourage young people to register to vote.[4]\nThe organization staged protests demanding legislative action to be taken to prevent similar shootings in the future and has vocally condemned U.S. lawmakers who have received political contributions from the National Rifle Association (NRA).[5][6][7][8] It was credited in The Washington Post as winning a \"stunning victory\" against the NRA in the Florida legislature in March 2018 when both houses voted for various gun control measures.[9] The law increased funding for school security and raised the required age to buy a gun from 18 to 21.[10]\nAmong the organization's most prominent members are Alfonso Calderon, Sarah Chadwick, Jaclyn Corin, Ryan Deitsch, X Gonz\u00e1lez, David Hogg, Cameron Kasky, and Alex Wind.[11][12][13] Corin, Gonz\u00e1lez, Hogg, Kasky, and Wind were featured on a cover of Time in March 2018.[14] In December later that year, it was announced that the March for Our Lives activists made the shortlist for Time's Person of the Year at number four.[15]\nThe group was co-formed by Cameron Kasky and his high school friends in the first four days after the shooting,[12] which was committed by a gunman who was a 19-year-old former student of the school and armed with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle.[16]\nThe initial three co-founders were Kasky, Alex Wind, and Sofie Whitney.[1][17] On February 15, 2018, one day after the shooting, Kasky met with Wind at a candlelight vigil.[17] Wind stated, \"The day after the shooting, we said something needs to happen; there needs to be a central space; there needs to be a movement.\"[17] After the vigil, Kasky invited Wind and Whitney to his house. Kasky came up with the name \"Never Again\" while the group stayed up through the night to make plans, and he posted \"Stay alert. #NeverAgain\" to Facebook.[12][18]\nOver the next three days after the shooting, the group gained over 35,000 followers on Facebook.[19] Kasky recruited other Stoneman Douglas students David Hogg, X Gonz\u00e1lez, and Delaney Tarr at a gun-control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where they spoke; other students quickly joined.[12][19] The students gave as many interviews as they could to television networks.[18] The group said they worked quickly to take advantage of the national media attention given to the shooting and its aftermath.[12] Numerous Stoneman Douglas students have been shown in media coverage.[1][18][20][21] By the next day, the group had created Twitter accounts and announced a March for Our Lives nationwide protest, for March 24, 2018.[22]\nStoneman Douglas teacher Ivy Schamis, who had been teaching her Holocaust History class about combating hate when the gunman fired shots into her classroom, stated she thought the Stoneman Douglas students' #NeverAgain hashtag was inspired by the class on Holocaust history.[23][24][25][26] In the classroom there had been a banner saying \"We Will Never Forget\", which a Holocaust survivor had given to Schamis.[23] Kelly Plaur, a student survivor from that class, is the great-granddaughter of an Auschwitz survivor.[25] Plaur protected Schamis during the shooting.[27] According to Schamis, the gunman was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he'd scrawled a swastika onto one of his ammunition magazines.[25] Schamis was presented with USC Shoah Foundation\u2019s inaugural Stronger Than Hate Educator Award in 2019. During her acceptance speech at the award ceremony, Schamis honored the two students Nicholas Dworet and Helena Ramsay from her class that were killed during the shooting. Schamis added, \"We share our stories in the hope that others understand that hate is not OK, it's never OK.\"[26]\nThe Fort Lauderdale gun control rally at Broward County Federal Courthouse on February 17, 2018 was attended by hundreds of supporters.[28] Elected officials and gun control advocates, including Florida Senator Gary Farmer, called for an increase in firearm restrictions and gun control legislation.[29] At this rally, X Gonz\u00e1lez began their speech with a moment of silence for the 17 victims killed in the school shooting.[30] They then gave an impassioned 11-minute speech, in which they demanded to know where the \"common sense\" was in America's gun laws, calling out members of Congress who have accepted contributions from the NRA.[30][31][32] Gonz\u00e1lez was noted for rebuking \"thoughts and prayers\" from the government and President Donald Trump.[31]\n",

        "paragraph": "Sheila Bellush was a 35-year-old mother of six who was murdered on November 7, 1997, by a hired gunman named Jose Del Toro, on the orders of her ex-husband, Allen Blackthorne. Blackthorne, who had stalked Bellush since their divorce in 1987, allegedly wanted custody of their two children.[1]\nSheila Leigh Walsh was born on October 19, 1962 in Topeka, Kansas. She married Blackthorne in 1982, and had two daughters, Stevie and Daryl. Their divorce was not amicable, with each accusing the other of abusing their children. Sheila married Jamie Bellush in 1993, and had quadruplets two years later. They moved to Sarasota, Florida, to escape the constant surveillance of her ex-husband.[1]\nBlackthorne was unhappy with his divorce from Sheila and began to harass her after she won custody of their children. When the Bellush family moved to Florida, he tracked her down using a private investigator and plotted to hire a man to beat her up. Blackthorne asked Daniel Alex Rocha, a golfing acquaintance with a minor criminal history, for help. Rocha was allegedly motivated to carry out the crime when told by Blackthorne that Sheila was abusing the two children, Stevie and Daryl.[2] Rocha then contacted a friend, Samuel Gonzales, who introduced him to his cousin, Jose Luis Del Toro, who agreed to do the attack for $14,000.[1][3]\nOn November 7, 1997, Del Toro traveled to Sarasota in a car registered to his grandmother, with the intention of assaulting Sheila. He stopped at a Sports Authority store to obtain camouflage clothes and at a gas station for directions to the address Rocha gave.[4] On his way to Bellush's house, Del Toro was spotted by a neighbor who memorized the license plate (this would later lead to his capture). Del Toro continued to the Sarasota home, where he broke in and saw Sheila with the quadruplets. In an interview with police before his conviction, he told them that he saw her with her children and saw how caring she was and almost didn't go through with it. He was about to leave, but Sheila noticed the door was open and then noticed him. Del Toro stated he couldn't run, so he shot Bellush in the face with a .45 caliber gun and slit her throat in full view of the quadruplets.[4] Her body was found a few hours later by 13-year-old Stevie when she returned from school.[5] The quadruplets had been walking around in Sheila's blood, leaving small bloody footprints all over the crime scene.[6] Several of the quadruplets were wearing life vests, which Sheila would put on them if she had to change one child's diaper so if the other children wandered off unattended and fell into the backyard pool, they wouldn't drown.[6]\nJose Del Toro fled to Mexico after committing the murder. He was extradited to the US in July 1999, and pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and armed burglary charges in 2000 in Florida. Circuit Judge Paul Logan gave Del Toro two consecutive life sentences, the maximum penalty for both charges. Gonzalez pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in June 1998 in a plea bargain; he was sentenced to 19 years in prison. Rocha opted to go to trial instead and was convicted of first-degree murder in January 1999 with Gonzalez's testimony; he received a life sentence.[4]\nAllen Blackthorne was convicted of federal charges of interstate conspiracy to commit murder and interstate domestic violence. He received two concurrent life sentences without the possibility of parole, starting at the Beaumont, Texas federal prison. In 2001, Blackthorne was nearly killed during an attack by a prison gang, after which he was segregated from the general prison population and eventually transferred to a Florida facility. Blackthorne died aged 59 on November 18, 2014, at the federal prison  in Terre Haute, Indiana. The cause of death in the case was not released.[7]\nThe books Every Breath You Take (ISBN\u00a09780743439749) by Ann Rule and The Truth is Stronger Than a Lie (ISBN\u00a00975318519) by Khari Imo are about this case. The case inspired the episode \"The Hired Help\" of the series Behind Mansion Walls, presented by Investigation Discovery, and a 2002 episode of A&E's American Justice, titled \"Brutal Revenge\" (since repackaged for The Biography Channel under the series title Notorious). This case was also illustrated in a 2011 episode of the Investigation Discovery Channel series FBI: Criminal Pursuit, titled \"Twisted Obsession\".[8]\nIn 2015, 48 Hours: Hard Evidence (48 Hours: Mystery/Investigation) on Investigation Discovery released an episode entitled \"Justice for Sheila.\" Investigation Discovery series Nothing Personal: Murder for Hire aired an episode titled \"Deadly Divorce\" in 2011.[9] In 2021, Vengeance: Killer Millionaires entitled Cashed Out that covered the case.\n",

        "paragraph": "Russell Edward \"Rusty Day\" Davidson (December 29, 1945 \u2013 June 3, 1982) was a lead vocalist,[1] best known for his work with Cactus, the Amboy Dukes, and Steve Gaines.\nDay joined the Amboy Dukes in 1969 after their former vocalist was fired. Day had just quit his own band, Rusty Day & the Midnighters. He stayed only for one album, Migration.\nCactus was conceived in late 1969 as a supergroup of the Vanilla Fudge rhythm section, bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice, plus guitarist Jeff Beck and singer Rod Stewart. However, Beck had an automobile accident and Stewart joined Ronnie Wood in Faces. Out of frustration, Bogert and Appice formed what became Cactus in early 1970. The cast was complete when Day joined them on vocals and Jim McCarty joined on lead guitar.\nHaving made a name for himself in Detroit's rock scene, Day worked to restore the Band Detroit to national prominence. The Band Detroit was formed as an offshoot of the Detroit Wheels by members Steve Gaines (who later joined Lynyrd Skynyrd), Teddy \"T-Mel\" Smith, Nathaniel Peterson, Terry Emery, Bill Hodgeson, and others. There is a recording of Rusty Day, Steve Gaines, and the rest of the band performing in 1973 called The Band Detroit - The Driftwood Tapes, which was released as a Lynyrd Skynyrd bootleg in 1998.\nIn 1976, Day re-incarnated Cactus by placing an ad in Rolling Stone which stated that he needed exceptionally good guitar, bass, and drums. This line-up lasted from 1976 until 1979, and featured Gary \"Madman\" Moffatt, who currently plays drums for .38 Special.\nDay turned down AC/DC's request to have him join their band to replace Bon Scott, and Rossington-Collins's request to have him replace Ronnie Van Zant. He eventually formed Uncle Acid & the Permanent Damage Band, which gained him a deal with Epic Records.\nRusty Day formed his last band, the Rusty Day Band, in 1979 and hired Jacksonville guitarist Mike Owings. Owings had just left the Jacksonville, Florida band Lizzy Borden with Steve Gaines' brother, Bob Gaines, as drummer. Owings was then 20 years old.\nDay was fatally shot at his home on June 3, 1982. His son, his dog, and Garth McRae were also fatally shot. The murder officially remains unsolved, although the Seminole County Sheriff's Office believe the victims may have known the perpetrator, and that the killings may have been drug related.[2] In 2011 and 2015, it was asserted that Ron Sanders, guitarist and bandmate in Uncle Acid & the Permanent Damage Band, was the perpetrator of the shooting. Sanders shot himself six weeks after the murders, when police surrounded his home on other matters.[3][4][5]\n",

He was sentenced to death on March 7, 2000, and has been on the Florida death row since. \nRory Conde was born on June 14, 1965 in Barranquilla, Colombia. His mother died of tetanus when he was six months old. Conde and his sister Nelly were then raised by their paternal grandmother. When Conde was twelve, they moved to Miami to live with Conde's father, Gustavo Conde. Conde did not like his father and thought he was emotionally abusive. Conde's future wife, Carla Conde, thought that Rory's outbursts were a result of sexual abuse at the hands of his father.\nRory and Carla were married in 1987, when he was 21 and she was 15, eventually having two children. Rory was an abusive husband and had a stint in jail in 1992 as a result of a fight with Carla over Rory bringing girls over. They later moved to a condo off the Tamiami Trail.\nThey stopped having sex and Rory would disappear at night. In July 1994 Carla moved out to her parents' house with their two children. Rory threatened to kill her if she dated anyone else.\nOn September 17, 1994, Conde killed cross dressing male prostitute,  Lazaro Comesana. He later said that he killed Lazaro after finding out he was a man during sex.\nConde then killed two more prostitutes, Elisa Martinez on October 8 and Charity Nava on November 20. On the back and buttocks of Charity he wrote \"THIRD! (A happy face dotting the 'i') I will call Dwight Chan 10. (A reference to WPLG anchor Dwight Lauderdale) [See] if you can catch me. (Using two eyes instead of the word 'See')\"[2][unreliable source?]\nConde then killed three more prostitutes: Wanda Crawford on November 25, Necole Schneider on December 17, and  Rhonda Dunn on January 12, 1995.\nHe strangled his victims to death and then anally raped the corpses afterward.\nConde was arrested on June 19, 1995 when Gloria Maestre, a prostitute he had bound head to toe, made enough noise to attract neighbors while Conde was in court for a shoplifting charge.\n",

Raja, while waiting for a tow truck by his disabled car, in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.[1][2][3]\nRaja, who was in plainclothes and in an unmarked white van, approached Jones, who was waiting by his disabled vehicle on a highway exit ramp.[4] Within seconds, Raja fired six shots at Jones, striking him three times.[5] After the shooting, Raja falsely claimed to investigators that he had identified himself as a police officer and shot Jones in self-defense; both assertions were disproved by an audio recording of the fatal shooting.[4]\nOn June 1, 2016, Raja was charged with manslaughter by culpable negligence and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm. He was convicted of the charges on March 7, 2019,[6] following an eight-day jury trial.[4] Raja was sentenced to 25 years in prison on April 25, 2019.[5]\nJones was born to father Clinton Jones Sr., who renovated houses, and mother, Anita Banks, a guidance counselor, who died from cancer in 2006.[7] Jones' older brother, C.

Jones' sisters are Melissa Jones-Elliott and Chanda and Cevon Jones; his stepmother is Katie Jones.[citation needed] Jones was black, and had a very large extended family; among his cousins are NFL defensive tackle Vince Wilfork and NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin.[8] He lived in Lake Worth, Florida.[1]\nJones attended Christa McAuliffe Middle School in Boynton Beach, Florida, where he played the French horn. His entire family was musical, and played instruments at home and at church.[9] Jones graduated from Santaluces Community High School in Lantana, where he played football.[10] Jones then graduated from the University of Akron with degrees in business administration and music. He worked as a youth mentor at My Brother's Keeper, a nonprofit organization that helps African-American youths.[8]\nJones worked at the Delray Beach Housing Authority for eight years. He was an inspector/assistant property manager, a job that involved inspecting housing units to make sure they were livable. The position also required assisting tenants and landlords with communication.[11][12]\nJones also worked part-time as a drummer.[13] He played in a band at his church, the Bible Church of God in Boynton Beach, where his grandfather, Sylvester Banks Sr., is a bishop. He also played with a band called Future Prezidents with bandmates that included Boris Simeonov and Mathew Huntsberger.[8]\nNouman Raja is a Muslim of Pakistani ancestry.[14][15] He was naturalized as an American citizen in 2001.  His grandfather was a police chief in Pakistan.[15]  He worked for a small Florida police department for several years prior to joining the Palm Beach Gardens police.

        "paragraph": "\nIn February 2018, a boycott emerged against the U.S. gun rights advocacy group National Rifle Association (NRA) and its business affiliates. The boycott and social media activism campaign arose in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. The NRA was criticized for its response, including its recommendation for schools to arm teachers and opposition to bans on certain weapons. Calls for companies to sever their ties to the NRA resulted in several companies discontinuing their business relationships with the NRA and cancelling discount programs offered to NRA members. The boycott extended to Canada where Mountain Equipment Co-op and the Running Room cut supplier relationships with Vista Outdoor.[1][2] Public pressure also caused a number of gun retailers to increase the age required to buy firearms and place other restrictions on gun sales.\nAfter the Parkland shooting, there was an unprecedented upsurge of public support for gun control advocacy groups[3] and significant backlash against the NRA for its response to the shooting, having argued that schools required more armed security to protect against the possibility of future attacks, and its continued calls to preserving the right to own semi-automatic firearms, such as those used in the shooting.[4][5]\nOn February 20, 2018, ThinkProgress asked over two dozen corporations offering discounts to NRA members whether they would continue their relationships with the NRA.[6] Several companies terminated their agreements with the NRA, and their announcements went viral, along with hashtags such as #BoycottNRA, started by activists like Michael Skolnik.[7] One of the first to respond to the boycott, First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately held bank in the United States, announced that it will not renew its deal for the \"official credit card of the NRA\".[8][9]\nOne class of companies targeted generally offer or offered discounts or free trials to NRA members, often advertised on the NRA website, in what is often termed affinity marketing. Access to discounts is a benefit of paying NRA membership dues[10] and the NRA promotes the opportunity to save hundreds of dollars more than the cost of membership.[11]\nCompanies that have severed ties with the NRA as of February 24, 2018, span banks, airlines, car rental services, hotels, and software companies.[12][13][14] They include:\nSeveral companies have been pressured to disaffiliate with the NRA, but have not, or have not issued statements indicating that they will.[35][26]\nPressure on FedEx to drop NRA discounts of up to 26 percent had been going on for nearly a year before the Florida shooting.[26][42] After several companies cut ties with the NRA, calls to boycott FedEx arose on social media under the hashtag #BoycottFedEx.[43]  In a statement, FedEx affirmed that while it does not fully agree with the NRA on issues of gun policy, it will continue its business relationship with the organization.[44][45][46] Due to a drop in NRA related volume that made the organization ineligible for discounts, the NRA was dropped from the program on October 30, 2018.[47]\nIn response to the NRA boycott several companies discontinued insurance products targeted at NRA members.\nVista Outdoor manufactures AR-15-style rifles under the Savage Arms brand and ammunition under the CCI and Federal brands as well as a range of bike related and other outdoor products including the Bell, Giro, CamelBak, and Blackburn brands. After the Parkland shooting, consumers called on retailers to stop selling all Vista Outdoor products specifically over the company's support of the NRA.\n",

Her body was recovered two days later near Perry, Florida.[2]\nHoffman was under drug court supervision for possession of 25 g[3] (0.9 oz.) of cannabis discovered during a traffic stop on February 22, 2007.[4]  On April 17, 2008,[5] Tallahassee, Florida police searched her apartment and uncovered another 151.7 g (5.328 oz.) of cannabis,[3] and four ecstasy pills.  Hoffman faced a possible prison sentence if charged and convicted on criminal charges related to the discovered drugs. Police attempted to persuade her to identify other marijuana dealers to avoid the charges. She refused.  The police then pressured her to act as a confidential informant in a drug sting operation instead in exchange for not being charged with additional drug charges. The purported goal of the operation was to buy 1,500 ecstasy pills, 2 oz. of cocaine, and two handguns, which was contrary to department policy, using $13,000 cash in a buy\u2013bust operation.  Hoffman's family stated that all three buys were very out-of-character for her.\nTwo narcotics officers arranged for the drug buy at a specific location and were providing security for the buy. That was later deemed to be insufficient manpower to protect the informant and still apprehend the suspects.\nWhile she was at the drug buy, with the policemen monitoring, the two suspects changed the location of the buy.  She was informed not to follow the suspects to the new location, but technical issues prevented her from actually receiving the instructions. Her police handlers lost track of her when she agreed with the suspects to change the plans and left the buy spot with the two suspects in their stolen silver BMW. While in transit, the two suspects allegedly executed her with the gun she was supposed to buy.[6]\nAccording to police documents, a witness described seeing the BMW stuck in a ditch, with a 2005 Volvo belonging to Hoffman idling nearby, between 7 pm and 7:30 pm, about 30 minutes after the police lost track of Hoffman. The witness claimed that the BMW drove off when he stopped to help the driver try to get the car out of the ditch, but the vehicle later returned as the witness was leaving. The witness claimed he became suspicious and decided to leave when the driver of the Volvo opened the trunk and revealed a camouflage blanket and neat stacks of female clothing.\nDeneilo R. Bradshaw, 23, and Andrea Jabbar Green, 25, who were fired from their jobs at a window tint and car detailing shop just days before the incident, were charged with armed robbery in connection with the events leading up to Hoffman's death.[7]\nThe Tallahassee Police Department admitted that Hoffman had no training to work undercover, she did not know the two men targeted in the sting, and she had no experience with cocaine or firearms and very little with MDMA.[6] The officers involved in the operation were suspended with pay, and the family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city.\nThe two sellers were charged by a grand jury with first degree murder.[8] Details of the murder itself were not released at the time.\nHoffman's story garnered many news headlines including a page on the Tallahassee Democrat[9] website dedicated to information surrounding her death.\n20/20 covered the story on July 25, 2008, and Dateline NBC covered it on January 16, 2009.\n",

        "paragraph": "Rachel Marie Wade (born February 27, 1990) is an American woman who was convicted of murder in the second degree in the 2009 murder of Sarah Ludemann in Pinellas Park, Florida.\nRachel Wade and Sarah Ludemann were romantic rivals who were competing for the affections of Wade's ex-boyfriend, Joshua Camacho. In the first six months of Ludemann's relationship with Camacho, police officers spoke to Wade six times regarding public confrontations with him. Wade also got into a verbal argument with the mother of Camacho's child. Camacho exhibited domestic violence against Ludemann, whom he punched in the face, but Ludemann did not press charges.[1]\nWade left insulting voicemails for Ludemann. Their rivalry quickly turned violent. They began to harass one another, and according to Wade, Ludemann would show up at an Applebee's where Wade worked in order to taunt her. During one incident, Ludemann told police that Wade repeatedly called her cell phone and left threatening voicemails.\nOn the evening of Tuesday April 14, 2009, authorities say that Wade was alone in her apartment waiting for Camacho. Camacho was watching movies with Ludemann. While Wade was outside walking her dog, she heard a car honk, and she stated that Ludemann yelled \"Stay away from my man!\" Wade said that she was scared and that she decided to call Javier Laboy, an old boyfriend. He told her to come over to his house. She got her purse, opened a kitchen drawer, and pulled out a steak knife.\nAt 11 p.m., Wade approached Camacho's house. He and Ludemann were inside playing video games. Wade sent Camacho a text message stating \"Now I know why you're not talking to me \u2014 because you got her.\" Camacho replied \"That's right. I don't like you no more. Why don't you go home?\" Wade responded \"No. I'll wait for her to go home.\" Witnesses later testified that they overheard Wade threaten Ludemann on speakerphone \"I'm going to stab you and your Mexican boyfriend.\" Just before midnight, Camacho's sister asked Ludemann for a ride to McDonald's. Ludemann saw a friend at a stop sign who told her Wade was at Javier Laboy's house. Ludemann decided to confront her. As she was driving, Wade called her and yelled \"I'm going to stab you! You and your Mexican boyfriend!\" Ludemann arrived at Javier Laboy's house and saw Wade speaking with him and their friend Dustin Grimes.\nWade testified that Ludemann slammed on her brakes, nearly hitting Wade and stormed out of the car with her fists flailing. Wade said that she was fearful when she stabbed Ludemann's shoulder and chest, one blow punctured her heart. However, authorities and the prosecution's witnesses said that Ludemann did not get a chance to leave the van and that it was Wade who approached and attacked Ludemann. Ludemann, mortally wounded, and clutching her chest, called Camacho to tell him what happened. Camacho ran to Ludemann's home to tell her father. They both drove to the scene. Immediately after the stabbing, witnesses say that Wade threw the knife over a neighbor's house and calmly said \"I'm done.\" Ludemann died at Northside Hospital as a result of a heart puncture, and was pronounced dead at 2:20\u00a0a.m. the next morning.\nPolice arrived and began questioning Wade and the witnesses. She began to cry when they told her Ludemann died. Hours later, Wade was arrested and charged with murder in the second degree. She was booked into the Pinellas County Jail on $500,000 bond. She stayed there through the conclusion of the trial.[1][2][3]\nTruTV's In Session televised the trial which began on July 20, 2010, with jury selection. After television coverage ended at 3pm each day, a live internet stream was provided by CNN. Testimony lasted three days from July 21 through July 23.[4] Prosecutors brought up the history between the two in order to show that Wade intended to kill her rival over Camacho. The defense argued self-defense under Florida's Stand Your Ground law.[5] Wade's attorney, Jay Hebert, stated that Ludemann was very upset and that Wade was fearful because she was outnumbered and because Ludemann was bigger than she. Hebert brought up the Applebee's incident in which Ludemann and her friends knocked Wade's tray over, sang Girlfight during karaoke and taunted her. He also stated that the two girls fought before the stabbing and pulled each other's hair. The witnesses who testified for the prosecution were Camacho, his sister, and Dustin Grimes. Javier testified for the defense. Javier stated that the two fought, but admitted he did not see much of the incident. Camacho's sister and Grimes testified that Wade approached the vehicle and stabbed Ludemann. The jury heard the voicemails, which Ludemann saved eight months prior, in which Wade stated that she was going to kill her. This ultimately sealed her fate as the jury of five men and one woman took just two and a half hours to find her guilty of murder in the second degree.[6][7]\nOn September 3, 2010, Rachel Wade was sentenced to 27 years in state prison. The judge stated that he believed Wade intended to kill Ludemann.[8] Wade maintained that she acted in self-defense, and appealed her case.[9] In a March 2011 interview with ABC News, she said that she believed that social media played a major part in the rivalry and murder, noting that social media gives people the ability to say whatever they want with very little consequence.[10] In April 2011, Charlie Ludemann, Sarah's father, filed a civil suit against Wade.[11] On February 17, 2012, Wade lost her appeal.[12] She is housed at Lowell Correctional Institution.\n",

        "paragraph": "In February 2009, Heather Strong (March 23, 1982 \u2013 February 15, 2009) was kidnapped and murdered in Marion County, Florida. Emilia Lily Carr, a rival for the affections of a man Strong had dated, came under suspicion. Carr denied any guilt and alleged her statements were coerced. Carr was nevertheless found guilty in December 2010 and sentenced to death by lethal injection in February 2011. Carr was one of five women on death row in the state of Florida.[1] On May 19, 2017, Emilia Carr was re-sentenced to life without parole.[2] Joshua Fulgham (Heather Strong's husband, and Carr's co-accused) was similarly convicted of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death.[3] At a separate trial, where he pled guilty, Joshua Fulgham received two consecutive sentences of life in prison for his involvement in Strong's murder.[4]\nEmilia Lily Carr was born Emilia Yera, on August 4, 1984. She was the second of three sisters.[5] A psychologist estimated her IQ to be 125.[6] At the age of 15, she reported abuse by her father to her school, but withdrew her statement to officials.[7] In February 2004, Carr's father was convicted of attempting to solicit the murders of his family (Emilia, her mother, and one of her sisters)[5] and was sentenced to four years in prison.\nCarr had been married twice and filed a restraining order against one of her ex-husbands for domestic violence. She was sentenced to two years of probation for her involvement in her ex-husband's grand theft of exotic birds.[5] Carr had three children at the time,[8] one of them with ex-boyfriend Jamie Acome.[5] At the time of the murder, she was eight months pregnant with a child presumed to be Joshua Fulgham's.[5]\nIn November 2008, Carr became engaged to Joshua Damien Fulgham, who instead married Heather Strong one month later. However, Carr maintained contact with them and babysat Strong's two children, according to Carr's family. In January 2009, Fulgham was arrested for threatening Strong with a shotgun, but was released after the charge of aggravated assault with a firearm was dropped. Investigators later discovered that Carr had threatened Strong with a knife to force her to withdraw her criminal complaint.[5] Carr and Fulgham re-established their relationship while Strong began seeing someone else.[9] Fulgham and Strong became involved in a legal battle over the custody of their two children.[10]\nIn February 2009, Heather Strong, then a 26-year-old resident of Citra, Florida, disappeared while employed at an Iron Skillet restaurant at a Petro gas station next to Interstate 75 in Reddick.[11] She was reported missing on February 15. Her remains were discovered on March 19,[9] in a shallow grave by a storage trailer in Boardman, near McIntosh, Florida. Carr was arrested on March 24, after investigators noted the frequency of her statements to authorities, ten in all without the presence of an attorney. Detectives also recorded undercover audio of Carr discussing details of the crime with Fulgham's sister. Carr, who at the time was seven months pregnant with Fulgham's child,[11] tricked Strong into the storage trailer behind the home of Carr's mother Maria and placed a plastic bag over her head after unsuccessfully trying to break her neck.[1] Strong eventually died of asphyxiation while bound by duct tape to a computer chair.[11][12]\nStrong's estranged husband Joshua Fulgham was arrested on suspicion of fraud for using her credit cards after she had disappeared.[9] Later in March 2009, Carr gave birth to her fourth child while in custody at Marion County Jail;[8] Her family gained custody of her older three children while her daughter by Fulgham has since been adopted. Carr provided a confession to investigators, but claimed that she had only done so in the hope of being reunited with her children.[13]\nEmilia Carr and Joshua Fulgham waived their right to a speedy trial during their arraignment for murder in April 2009. Prosecutor Rock Hooker immediately filed notice of his intent to pursue the death penalty because of the heinous nature of the crime.[9] In November 2009, State Circuit Judge Willard Pope declined Emilia Carr's request for a continuance of the trial because of her concerns over the preparedness of defense attorney Candace Hawthorne.[8] A jury found Carr guilty of first-degree murder and kidnapping after two and a half hours of deliberations on December 7, 2010.[11] During the penalty phase of the trial, Carr's family testified on her behalf that she had been traumatized since her early childhood by sexual abuse from her father and grandfather.[6] However, the jury voted 7-to-5 on December 10 in favor of the death penalty for Carr.[14][15] She was formally sentenced to death by lethal injection on February 22, 2011.[1]\nMore than a year after Carr's conviction for the murder of Heather Strong, her co-defendant Joshua Fulgham went on trial for his alleged participation in the murder in April 2012. Carr, on death row at the Lowell Correctional Institution Annex,[16] would not testify at the trial. The prosecution detailed the gruesome aspects of the crime. Both the prosecution and Fulgham's defense attorneys agreed that the motives for Heather Strong's murder were jealousy and betrayal.[17] At the conclusion of his trial, Fulgham was convicted of first-degree murder and kidnapping.[3] Despite the death sentence of his co-defendant, Joshua's jury voted 8-to-4 to sentence him to life in prison without a chance of parole[18] and the judge followed the jury's recommendation.[4]\nCarr was placed in the annex at Lowell Correctional Institution in Marion County on February 23, 2011. She was one of five women on death row in Florida, the other four being Tiffany Cole, Margaret Allen, Ana Maria Cardona and Tina Brown. Carr also became the first woman to be sentenced to death in Marion County since the 1992 sentencing of Aileen Wuornos. On May 19, 2017, Emilia Carr was re-sentenced to life without parole.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "Francis Langhorne Dade (1793? \u2013 December 28, 1835) was a Brevet Major in the U.S. 4th Infantry Regiment, United States Army, during the Second Seminole War. Dade was killed in a battle with Seminole Indians that came to be known as the \"Dade Massacre\".\nDade was born in Virginia, most likely in King George County.[1] He joined the Twelfth Infantry in March 1813 (during the War of 1812) as a third lieutenant. He was transferred to the Fourth Infantry in May 1815.[2] Under this post, he successfully led two military expeditions, in 1825 and 1826, from Fort Brooke in Tampa to Fort King near Ocala, through an area that was wilderness at the time and in the midst of ongoing conflict with Native Americans. He also commanded the United States Army base at Key West, and was eventually assigned to command the southern portion of Florida, running from Cape Florida on the Atlantic coast to Charlotte Harbor on the Gulf coast.[3] He was brevetted major in February 1828 after ten years of service as a captain.[2] By late 1835, he commanded a unit of 47 men, half of whom were European immigrants.[3] Dade was stationed in Key West until October of 1835, when violence broke out in the Second Seminole War. General Duncan Lamont Clinch ordered Dade to leave one noncommissioned officer and 3 privates in Key West before taking the rest of his men to Fort Brooke.[4]\nDade's final mission was to lead 110 men from Fort Brooke to Fort King. The Seminoles, led by Osceola and Micanopy, destroyed bridges over the Hillsborough River and Withlacoochee River in order to delay the progress of the command, and ambushed the men on December 28, killing Dade and most of his men, and leaving only two survivors. The attack was followed in 1836 by widespread attacks on white settlers in Florida, and then by a US military buildup under General Winfield Scott. Dade and his men were not formally buried until a unit led by Edmund P. Gaines arrived at the site of the massacre in February 1836, Dade's remains only being identifiable by his vest and infantry buttons.[3]\nWhen hostilities ceased, the Army proposed to transfer the remains of all who died in the territory, including those who fell with Dade, to a single burial ground. Reinterment took place at the St. Augustine Post Cemetery, which would become St. Augustine National Cemetery. In addition to Dade's command, more than 1,400 soldiers were interred in three mass graves. These men are memorialized by the Dade Monument, which is composed of three distinct pyramids, constructed of native coquina stone, and an obelisk. The dedication of the memorial at a ceremony on August 14, 1842, marked the end of the Florida Indian Wars.\nThe Dade Monument was erected in 1845 at the United States Military Academy Cemetery to honor Major Dade and the men under his command killed in the Seminole War. \nMiami-Dade County, Florida (Dade County, until 1997); Dade County, Georgia;[5] Dade County, Missouri; Dadeville, Alabama; and Dade City, Florida are all named after Major Dade. The now decommissioned fort on Egmont Key was also named for him. The battle is re-enacted at the Dade Battlefield Historic State Park each year. In 2002, the Dade County Courthouse was renamed the Major Francis Langhorne Dade County Courthouse by the Board of County Commissioners of Miami-Dade County. In the resolution changing the courthouse's name, the Board noted that it found \"that Major Francis Langhorne Dade is a person who made a significant contribution to Miami-Dade County\".[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "Willie James Hodges (born June 19, 1960) is an American murderer and suspected serial killer who has been convicted of a 2001 murder in Florida, to which he has been linked to via DNA evidence, and remains the prime suspect in two additional murders in Alabama and Ohio with which he has never been charged. Originally sentenced to death for the Florida conviction, the sentence was later overturned following Hurst v. Florida and he was subsequently resenteced to life imprisonment.\nHodges' first suspected murder is that of 66-year-old Winnie Johnson, who was shot to death during a burglary of her home in Sumter County, Alabama on November 26, 2001.[1]\nOn December 19, Hodges broke into a home in Pensacola, Florida, occupied by 58-year-old Patricia Belanger. After encountering her, he proceeded to beat her with a claw hammer on the head and stab her once in the neck with a steak knife, which immediately killed her. Upon ransacking the house, Hodges left through the window, but at that time, two relatives who had come to pick Belanger for a holiday trip to Idaho Falls, Idaho came to the house and discovered her body.[2] While they managed to get a good look at him and call the police, who attempted to track him down using K-9 units and a helicopter, Hodges managed to evade arrest. The killing shocked and frightened Belanger's neighbors and the surrounding community, as it correlated to a series of violent crimes that had recently taken place in Pensacola.[2] The day after the murder, a facial composite was released to the public with a description of Belanger's suspected killer and the clothes he was wearing, but this did not lead to an arrest.[3]\nThe final murder linked to Hodges took place on March 19, 2003, when 81-year-old Laverne Jansen was raped and beaten to death at her apartment in Cincinnati, Ohio.[4] It was speculated that she had been followed home after purchasing a lottery ticket at the Glenway Pony Keg, whereupon her killer knocked on the door and forced his way inside once the door was opened. This interaction was secretly observed by a neighbor of Jansen who described what she was seeing through a peephole, but a 16-minute delay to arrive at the scene on the officers' side resulted in the suspect escaping.[5] Ten days later, Cincinnati Police Department announced that they were searching for an unidentified person of interest in the case who was last seen shopping at the Glenway Pony Keg, but this did not lead to an arrest.[6] The responding officers would later receive counseling for their handling of the case.[7]\nOn September 5, Hodges was arrested for two attempted burglaries in Pensacola, for which he was lodged in jail and remanded to await trial. As a previously convicted felon, he was ordered to provide a fingerprint and DNA sample to the authorities, which was entered into CODIS.[8] In the meantime, investigators who were assigned to Pensacola's cold case unit took notice of a photograph found at the Belanger homicide, identifying the individual in it as Vonkish Golden, Hodges' cousin, who was currently imprisoned. Through an interview with him, they learned that Hodges had stayed with his family at the time of the murder and that he had helped a relative - a next-door neighbor of Belanger - to fix his truck.[9] After obtaining his fingerprints, they were found to be a perfect match to the crime scene, and after browsing through Hodges' personal items, investigators found a blood-stained receipt that matched a bloodied sock found inside Belanger's house.[9] Finally, his DNA was matched to the Belanger crime scene, and Hodges was subsequently charged with her murder as well.[10] Hodges proclaimed his innocence, claiming that he had gone inside Belanger's home in order to close her windows, as he believed that she had already left but had forgotten to close them.\nThe following year, investigators from Alabama and Ohio charged Hodges with the two murders in their respective jurisdictions, citing similarities to the Belanger case.[11] However, it was decided that Hodges should first be tried in Florida, where prosecutors would seek the death penalty and had managed to convince the judge that despite his low IQ, the defendant knew right from wrong and was thus sane to stand trial.[12] His trial began in February 2008.[13]\nDue to the overwhelming amount of evidence against him, Hodges was swiftly found guilty by a jury verdict.[14] He was subsequently sentenced to death in February 2009.[15]\nIn March 2017, in the aftermath of Hurst v. Florida, Hodges applied to have his sentence commuted to life imprisonment citing ineffective counsel and a non-unanimous decision of 10-2 for his death sentence.[16] According to the Florida Department of Corrections, Hodges' sentence was successfully commuted and he is currently incarcerated at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Lake City. It is unclear if he will be charged with the murders in Alabama and Ohio.\n",

        "paragraph": "In February 2009, Heather Strong (March 23, 1982 \u2013 February 15, 2009) was kidnapped and murdered in Marion County, Florida. Emilia Lily Carr, a rival for the affections of a man Strong had dated, came under suspicion. Carr denied any guilt and alleged her statements were coerced. Carr was nevertheless found guilty in December 2010 and sentenced to death by lethal injection in February 2011. Carr was one of five women on death row in the state of Florida.[1] On May 19, 2017, Emilia Carr was re-sentenced to life without parole.[2] Joshua Fulgham (Heather Strong's husband, and Carr's co-accused) was similarly convicted of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death.[3] At a separate trial, where he pled guilty, Joshua Fulgham received two consecutive sentences of life in prison for his involvement in Strong's murder.[4]\nEmilia Lily Carr was born Emilia Yera, on August 4, 1984. She was the second of three sisters.[5] A psychologist estimated her IQ to be 125.[6] At the age of 15, she reported abuse by her father to her school, but withdrew her statement to officials.[7] In February 2004, Carr's father was convicted of attempting to solicit the murders of his family (Emilia, her mother, and one of her sisters)[5] and was sentenced to four years in prison.\nCarr had been married twice and filed a restraining order against one of her ex-husbands for domestic violence. She was sentenced to two years of probation for her involvement in her ex-husband's grand theft of exotic birds.[5] Carr had three children at the time,[8] one of them with ex-boyfriend Jamie Acome.[5] At the time of the murder, she was eight months pregnant with a child presumed to be Joshua Fulgham's.[5]\nIn November 2008, Carr became engaged to Joshua Damien Fulgham, who instead married Heather Strong one month later. However, Carr maintained contact with them and babysat Strong's two children, according to Carr's family. In January 2009, Fulgham was arrested for threatening Strong with a shotgun, but was released after the charge of aggravated assault with a firearm was dropped. Investigators later discovered that Carr had threatened Strong with a knife to force her to withdraw her criminal complaint.[5] Carr and Fulgham re-established their relationship while Strong began seeing someone else.[9] Fulgham and Strong became involved in a legal battle over the custody of their two children.[10]\nIn February 2009, Heather Strong, then a 26-year-old resident of Citra, Florida, disappeared while employed at an Iron Skillet restaurant at a Petro gas station next to Interstate 75 in Reddick.[11] She was reported missing on February 15. Her remains were discovered on March 19,[9] in a shallow grave by a storage trailer in Boardman, near McIntosh, Florida. Carr was arrested on March 24, after investigators noted the frequency of her statements to authorities, ten in all without the presence of an attorney. Detectives also recorded undercover audio of Carr discussing details of the crime with Fulgham's sister. Carr, who at the time was seven months pregnant with Fulgham's child,[11] tricked Strong into the storage trailer behind the home of Carr's mother Maria and placed a plastic bag over her head after unsuccessfully trying to break her neck.[1] Strong eventually died of asphyxiation while bound by duct tape to a computer chair.[11][12]\nStrong's estranged husband Joshua Fulgham was arrested on suspicion of fraud for using her credit cards after she had disappeared.[9] Later in March 2009, Carr gave birth to her fourth child while in custody at Marion County Jail;[8] Her family gained custody of her older three children while her daughter by Fulgham has since been adopted. Carr provided a confession to investigators, but claimed that she had only done so in the hope of being reunited with her children.[13]\nEmilia Carr and Joshua Fulgham waived their right to a speedy trial during their arraignment for murder in April 2009. Prosecutor Rock Hooker immediately filed notice of his intent to pursue the death penalty because of the heinous nature of the crime.[9] In November 2009, State Circuit Judge Willard Pope declined Emilia Carr's request for a continuance of the trial because of her concerns over the preparedness of defense attorney Candace Hawthorne.[8] A jury found Carr guilty of first-degree murder and kidnapping after two and a half hours of deliberations on December 7, 2010.[11] During the penalty phase of the trial, Carr's family testified on her behalf that she had been traumatized since her early childhood by sexual abuse from her father and grandfather.[6] However, the jury voted 7-to-5 on December 10 in favor of the death penalty for Carr.[14][15] She was formally sentenced to death by lethal injection on February 22, 2011.[1]\nMore than a year after Carr's conviction for the murder of Heather Strong, her co-defendant Joshua Fulgham went on trial for his alleged participation in the murder in April 2012. Carr, on death row at the Lowell Correctional Institution Annex,[16] would not testify at the trial. The prosecution detailed the gruesome aspects of the crime. Both the prosecution and Fulgham's defense attorneys agreed that the motives for Heather Strong's murder were jealousy and betrayal.[17] At the conclusion of his trial, Fulgham was convicted of first-degree murder and kidnapping.[3] Despite the death sentence of his co-defendant, Joshua's jury voted 8-to-4 to sentence him to life in prison without a chance of parole[18] and the judge followed the jury's recommendation.[4]\nCarr was placed in the annex at Lowell Correctional Institution in Marion County on February 23, 2011. She was one of five women on death row in Florida, the other four being Tiffany Cole, Margaret Allen, Ana Maria Cardona and Tina Brown. Carr also became the first woman to be sentenced to death in Marion County since the 1992 sentencing of Aileen Wuornos. On May 19, 2017, Emilia Carr was re-sentenced to life without parole.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "Lionel Alexander Tate (born January 30, 1987)[1] is the youngest American citizen ever sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, though this sentence was eventually overturned.[2] In January 2001, when Tate was 13, he was convicted of first-degree murder for the 1999 battering death of six-year-old Tiffany Eunick in Broward County, Florida.[3]\nOn July 28, 1999, Tate was left alone with Eunick, who was being babysat by Tate's mother, Kathleen Grossett-Tate. While the children were downstairs playing, Tate's mother called to them to be quiet. Tate came up 45 minutes later to say that Eunick was not breathing. He said that while they were wrestling, he had her in a headlock and the child's head hit a table. Only Eunick and Grossett-Tate were present when this occurred. \nTate was convicted of killing Eunick by stomping on her so forcefully that her liver was lacerated. Her legs, feet, and neck all had serious bruises; an example of the amount of force used on her was similar to bruises from that of a speeding car.[4] Her other injuries included a fractured skull, fractured rib, and swollen brain. These injuries were characterized by the prosecution as \"similar to those she would have sustained by falling from a three-story building.\"[5] In sentencing Tate to life imprisonment, Judge Joel T. Lazarus of Broward County Circuit Court said that \"The acts of Lionel Tate were not the playful acts of a child [...] The acts of Lionel Tate were cold, callous and indescribably cruel.\"[6]\nFlorida Statutes required the jury to convict Tate of first-degree murder even if the jury did not believe that he intended to kill or injure anyone\u2014all that was required was that Tate knowingly abused another child who died as a result, as any intentional act that could reasonably be expected to result in physical injury to a child is child abuse per Florida statutes.[7][8][9] The rule for such convictions is known as the felony murder rule. The sufficient conditions of the felony murder rule were listed by the judge Joel T. Lazarus during sentencing.[10] Therefore, Tate was sentenced to life in prison without the prosecution having to prove that he intended to kill or injure, or realized that his acts are likely to kill or injure, or even that a typical child of his age would or should realize this.\nCritics, such as the various groups listed in the amicus brief attached to Tate's appeal, assert that convicting preteen children of first-degree murder without having to prove these children intended any harm, not to mention serious injury or death, is unacceptable.[11][12]\nThe sentence was controversial because Tate was 12 years old at the time of the murder, and his victim was 6. He was the youngest person in modern US history to be sentenced to life imprisonment,[2] bringing broad criticism on the treatment of juvenile offenders in the justice system of the state of Florida.\nAfter the conviction, the prosecution openly joined Tate's plea for leniency in sentencing and even offered to help in his appeal. The trial judge criticized the prosecution for compromising the integrity of the adversarial system, and said that if the prosecution felt that life imprisonment was not warranted, they should not have charged him with murder in the first place.[13]\nIn January 2004, a state appeals court overturned his conviction on the basis that his mental competency had not been evaluated before trial. This opened the way for Tate to accept the same plea deal he originally turned down, and he was released on one year's house arrest and 10 years' probation.[14]\nOn May 23, 2005, Tate was charged with armed burglary with battery, armed robbery, and violation of probation, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said.[15]\n",

He also studied shortly at the University of Cape Town. He was  admitted to the Florida Bar in 2004 and remained an active member. \nFor nine years he worked at a private law firm, Foley & Mansfield Partner, in Miami. At Foley & Mansfield Partner he worked on cases of civil litigation, product liability, contracts, personal injury, wrongful death, and medical malpractice defense. His next job was as Assistant State Attorney in Jacksonville, Florida, his hometown. He joined the United States Attorney's Office in Miami in January 2017. \nHe lived in Miramar, Florida a suburb of Miami. He was an active member of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit Professionalism Panel and Chair of The Florida Bar\u2019s Eleventh Judicial Circuit Grievance Committee in Division \u2018L. He was a member of the William Reece Smith Jr. Leadership Academy as well as a member of The Florida Bar\u2019s Judicial Nominations Procedure committee and of the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s Commission on Professionalism.

Paris was subject to severe physical abuse at the hands of his father, Ronnie Paris Sr., who was convinced he was homosexual despite his young age, and was forced to box repeatedly, eventually entering a coma and dying from brain injuries.[1][2][3][4] His death brought attention to the Florida Department of Children & Families for failing to identify the child abuse and neglect. Controversy arose over Paris being removed from his home and placed in to foster care, only to be returned, and died within six weeks from continued abuse.[5][6][7] Ronnie Paris Sr. was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 30-years in prison.\nIn May 2002, the Florida Department of Children and Family Services removed Paris from his home and placed him in protective custody, after he was admitted to the hospital for repeated vomiting, and doctors determined he was undernourished and had a broken arm.[8]\nOn December 13, 2004, four days after his third birthday, Paris was returned to his parents. This replacement was the subject of investigation by the local press because they felt it represented a breakdown of the child welfare system.[9][10]  On January 22, Paris slipped into a coma after falling asleep on a couch at a family friend's house, where his parents were attending a Bible study. Upon realizing he was unconscious, his parents rushed into the hospital. Paris died six days later, when he was removed from life support.[11]\nDetective Anthony Zambito was suspicious and testified that \"it wasn't until investigators questioned them separately\" that the boy's mother spoke of abuse.[3] During an investigation of the child's death, his mother\u2014Nysheera Paris\u2014told detectives that her husband\u2014Ronnie Paris, Sr. -- had repeatedly abused the child, slapping him in the back of the head, slamming him into walls, and forcing the child to participate in father-son boxing matches until the boy began to shake, cry, and wet himself.[12]\nThe child's father was charged with murder and aggravated child abuse.[3] His mother was charged with child neglect and failing to get medical attention for her son.[13] In July 2005, Ronnie Paris Sr. went on trial for his son's murder facing a maximum of 15 years for the death.[3] During the trial witnesses testified the boy had been slapped around and thrown into walls by his dad to toughen him up.[14][15] Nysheera Paris testified that her husband thought their son might be gay, and that he would smack the boy in the back of the head and slam him into walls because he didn't want his son to grow up \"soft.\"[16]  Her testimony was corroborated by her sister, Shanita Powell, who said \"He was trying to teach him how to fight,\" and told the court \"He was afraid the child might be gay.\"[17][18]  Family friend Sheldon Bostick, who attended Bible study with the Paris family, testified that Ronnie Paris, Sr., \"slap-boxed\" with his son because \"He didn't want him to be a sissy\"[19] Paris Sr. had reported this was how he had been taught, by his father, to take a punch.[20]\nForensic pathologist Dr. Sam Gulino noted the child's scarred face and bruised head, and told the court that the lethargy and vomiting spells, the coma and eventual death were due to head trauma that was not accidental but deliberately inflicted.\nThe child's foster mother testified that during the two years he lived with her, Paris never vomited, and had a healthy appetite.[21]\nIn July 2005, after three hours of deliberation,[22] a jury convicted Ronnie Paris, Sr. of second degree manslaughter and aggravated child abuse in the death of his son.[23] On August 19, 2005, he was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment,[24] and ten years probation.[25] The mother Nysheera Paris was sentenced to 5 years probation for culpable negligence in the death of her son.[26]\nThe crime is also seen as a hate crime by LGBT supporters, including Tennessee artist James McKissic who premiered a large scale painting of Paris Jr. along with two other \"youth of color who were victims of hate crimes\" at the Chattanooga African American Museum in 2008.[27] The Gay American Heroes Foundation, memorializing LGBT murder victims of \"hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation bias,\" will include Paris Jr. in their traveling memorial that visits cities where someone has been murdered for being LGBT or thought to be.[28]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn February 14, 2018, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Miami suburban town of Parkland, Florida, murdering 17 people[note 2] and injuring 17 others.[2][3][4] Cruz, a former student at the school, fled the scene on foot by blending in with other students, and was arrested without incident approximately one hour later in nearby Coral Springs.[5] Police and prosecutors investigated \"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\".[6]\nThe killing spree is the deadliest high school shooting in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre that killed 15, including the perpetrators, in Colorado in April 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

        "paragraph": "In May 2012, 31-year-old Marissa Alexander was prosecuted for aggravated assault with a lethal weapon and received a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison. Alexander said that she fired a warning shot after her husband attacked her and threatened to kill her on August 1, 2010, in Jacksonville, Florida.\nSome time after her conviction, a new trial was ordered. Before the new trial could begin, Alexander was released on January 27, 2015, under a plea deal that capped her sentence to the three years she had already served.\nAlexander was in the home of her estranged husband Rico Gray, when Alexander stated that Gray threatened to kill her[1] via texts on Alexander's phone. Gray had previously abused Alexander, giving her reason to believe that her life was in danger.[2][3][4][5]\nAccording to Alexander, she tried to escape through the garage, but the garage door would not open.[3] This account was confirmed by Gray in a sworn deposition,[4] although investigators found no problem with the door.  According to all accounts, Alexander then retrieved her gun from her vehicle and went to the kitchen. Alexander fired a \"warning shot\" towards Gray with his children nearby, which hit the wall near Gray at the height of his head, then deflected into the ceiling.[6][7] The single shot did not injure anyone.[8] According to one source, Alexander had fired the warning shot because of Florida's stand-your-ground law, a law that allows self-defense, such as lethal force, in life-threatening situations, but a warning shot was not legal at that time.[clarification needed][citation needed]\nAlexander, who had a history of suffering domestic violence from Gray, and had been previously accused of domestic violence herself, and who had recently been released from jail (after having assaulted the father of her child), returned to Gray's house, despite him having a restraining order forbidding her presence at the house, sought self-defense immunity prior to trial but was unsuccessful.[4] State Attorney Angela Corey met with the defendant and offered her a three-year plea deal.  Asserting that she acted in self-defense within the bounds of the law, Alexander rejected the offer and took her case to trial.[3] A jury convicted her in twelve minutes,[9] and because of the Florida 10-20-Life mandatory minimum statute, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison.[10] Alexander was also requested to stay away from Gray as part of a court order.[9]\nOn September 26, 2013, an appellate court ordered a new trial, finding that the jury instructions in Alexander's trial impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defense.[11][12] Alexander was released on bail on November 27, 2013[13] and required to stay under house arrest.[14] Corey announced that she intended to re-prosecute Alexander, this time aiming for three consecutive 20 year sentences, amounting to a mandatory 60-year sentence if Alexander is found guilty in a second trial.[15]\nMarissa Alexander retained legal and investigative assistance during her second trial that she did not prior to her first trial, including a partner at the law firm of Holland & Knight, private investigator Patrick McKenna, and digital collections and forensics through Capsicum Group.\nOn January 27, 2015, Alexander was released from a Jacksonville jail under a plea deal that capped her sentence to the three years she had already served. She pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated assault for firing a shot in the direction of her husband. She also agreed to serve two years of house arrest, wearing an ankle monitor. She will be allowed to work, attend classes and take her children to school and medical appointments. Her case helped to inspire a new state law permitting warning shots in some circumstances.[16]\nCorey was criticized for her handling of the case by Democratic Florida Congresswoman Corrine Brown, who argued that Corey overcharged Alexander and the result of Alexander's case was a consequence of institutional racism.[17] Mariame Kaba, Rev. Jesse Jackson, anti-domestic violence advocates, civil rights groups, and others also supported the call for Alexander's release from prison.[18] Several groups such as the National Organization for Women (NOW) and the national advocacy group Color of Change petitioned to ask for Corey's removal from this case.[19] NOW called for Corey to resign over the case, saying Corey was \"misusing her office and endangering domestic violence survivors.\"[20] Color of Change stated that they would attempt to collect 100,000 signatures to remove Corey from the case.[19]\n",

The jury could not reach a verdict about whether to convict Dunn for the murder of Davis at the first trial. In a second trial, Dunn was found guilty of the first-degree murder of Davis and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole plus 105 years in prison, which is two de facto consecutive life sentences.[4][5]\nIn 2021, the jury and judges on the Florida Supreme Court rejected Dunn's appeal based on the stand-your-ground law in Florida.\nDunn and his fianc\u00e9e Rhonda Rouer traveled from their home in Brevard County to attend Dunn's son's wedding in Orange Park, near Jacksonville, Florida. Dunn and Rouer left the wedding early in order to return to their hotel and take care of their six-month-old puppy. On the way back to their hotel, the two decided to stop at the Gate Petroleum gas station to purchase a bottle of wine.[6]\nTommie Stornes, Leland Brunson, Jordan Davis, and Tevin Thompson had been spending the day traveling to various malls when they decided to go to the Gate Petroleum gas station in order to buy gum and cigarettes.[7]\nThe shooting of Jordan Davis took place in Jacksonville in Duval County. Around 7:30\u00a0p.m., four teenage boys (Leland Brunson, Jordan Davis, Tommie Stornes, and Tevin Thompson) stopped at a Gate Petroleum gas station. Stornes left his red Dodge Durango SUV running while he went into the store. Brunson, Davis, and Thompson remained in the vehicle listening to music which was described as \"very loud.\" Dunn, driving a black Volkswagen Jetta sedan, and his fianc\u00e9e Rhonda Rouer pulled into the right adjacent parking spot.[8] Rouer left their car to purchase white wine and chips.[9] She testified that Dunn told her \"I hate that thug music,\" before she left the car for the store, though Dunn claims he used the phrase \"rap crap.\"[10][11]\nThe bass from the loud music playing in the teens' SUV annoyed Dunn, who asked for it to be turned down.[9][12] The front seat passenger, Tevin Thompson, initially complied and turned the volume down, but Jordan Davis requested the volume be turned back up.[13][14]\nDavis' protests continued and an independent witness overheard Dunn say \"No, you're not gonna talk to me that way.\" Dunn, who had a concealed weapons permit,[8] took a handgun out of his glove compartment and started firing at Davis' door, hitting him in the legs, lungs, and aorta. As the SUV backed up to evade his gunshots, Dunn opened his own door and continued firing at the car in shooter's stance, as the boys ducked for cover. Dunn later testified that he still feared for his safety as well as that of Rouer who was to return to the vehicle imminently.[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "Donald David Dillbeck (born May 24, 1963) is a convicted murderer currently on Florida's death row for the stabbing and murder of a woman in a Tallahassee, Florida mall parking lot.\nAt age six, his father walked out on him and Dillbeck's alcoholic mother and he was placed in several foster homes until age 15.[1] On April 11, 1979, Dillbeck, a 15-year-old high school dropout and runaway,[2] was sitting inside a stolen car at a closed park at the beach in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. Someone made a suspicious person complaint about this, and Lee County deputy Lynn Hall arrived and questioned Dillbeck. While being questioned by Deputy Lynn Hall, Dillbeck ran from the car. The deputy chased Dillbeck on foot and caught him. During the struggle that followed, Dillbeck, only 15 years old at the time, managed to get the deputy's gun and shot and fatally wounded him.[3] Dillbeck was arrested and, on June 6, 1979, sentenced to life imprisonment.\nOn February 7, 1983, Dillbeck attempted to escape prison but was re-captured the same day. For this, he was sentenced to one year and one day in prison. He was later given a 25-year mandatory minimum sentence and taken to a lower-security facility despite being disciplined multiple times, including attempted assault in 1984 and drinking intoxicants the following year.[4]\nOn June 22, 1990, Dillbeck was working with other prison inmates at a catering function at Quincy Vocational Center in Quincy, Florida. During the event, Dillbeck walked away from the area and eventually ended up in Tallahassee, Florida. Dillbeck purchased a paring knife, and on June 24, 1990, less than 48 hours after his escape, he approached a woman named Faye Vann, who was sitting in her vehicle in the parking lot of the Tallahassee Mall. Armed with the knife, Dillbeck attempted to carjack the vehicle entering it, but Vann resisted. He then stabbed Vann repeatedly, causing her death. The vehicle crashed in the mall lot, and Dillbeck fled on foot, chased by a mall security guard. First, reports to 911 were of a vehicle crash, then soon were relayed as a stabbing and a security guard in foot pursuit of the suspect.[5] Dillbeck was subsequently arrested by police a short time later still armed with the knife in a back yard of a nearby house. Governor Bob Martinez criticized the incident, ordering tighter custody of inmates and firing the corrections officers involved.[4][6] According to a 1991 article, the case was \"reminiscent\" of Willie Horton being released in 1988 by Michael Dukakis's release programs.[7]\nAccording to a 1991 article, Dillbeck's name was the codeword for incompetence between Bob Martinez and Lawton Chiles during their political campaigns. His court-appointed lawyer later admitted to Dillbeck's crimes but tried to save him from the electric chair,[1] but to no avail. Dillbeck was sentenced to die in the electric chair in 1991. At the sentencing, he told the judge, \"I'm really sorry for what happened. I wish it didn't, not because I'm standing here, but because it happened. I'm asking for a life sentence, not for my sake, but for my parents' sake,\" to which his adoptive parents said Dillbeck \"had been brain damaged and abused.\"[8] In 1993, the state appeals court awarded $150,000 to the Vann's family but later overturned it in 1995, saying \"the state couldn't be held liable for failing to protect the public from prison escapees\" and \"the only duty which existed was a general duty owed to the public not to allow a prisoner escape\"; the state court did not say, however, if it could be held liable for the acts of prison escapees.[9]\nDillbeck was convicted of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and armed burglary and was sentenced to death on March 15, 1991.[10] In addition, he received two consecutive life sentences on top of the one he already had. He was not sentenced for his escape from Quincy Vocational Center. Dillbeck is currently on death row at the Florida State Prison located in Raiford, Florida. On January 23, 2023, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed Dillbeck\u2019s death warrant, scheduling his execution for February 23, 2023.[11][12]\n",

At his apartment in Orlando, Florida, he was shot dead by FBI agent Aaron McFarlane during a police interview on May 22, 2013. He had allegedly attacked the agent, with a pipe or stick, while writing a statement about the Boston Marathon bombings and a triple homicide that took place in Waltham, Massachusetts, on September 11, 2011. The investigators involved in the incident said that Todashev had implicated both himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the Waltham murders before he was killed.\nIbragim Todashev was born on September 22, 1985, in the Chechen-Ingush capital Grozny during the Soviet era, as the eldest of 12 children of Abdulbaki (or Abdul-Baki) Todashev and his two wives.[1] During the 1990s, his family fled war-torn Chechnya to Russia's Saratov Oblast. They resided there until the late 2000s, before moving back to Grozny, where his father became a high-ranking pro-Moscow official in the city administration in 2008.[2][3]\nTodashev moved to the U.S. to study English on a J-1 non-immigrant visa, after four years of study in classes at Saratov State University and Chechen State University, as part of a student exchange program with Russia. He then applied for and was granted asylum in 2008 and permanent residence in March 2013.[2][3][4] His father said his son had no reason to fear \"oppression\" back home as \"he was too young to fight in the war [in Chechnya], and he has nothing to fear here now\" from the authorities.[5] He said: \"Out of fear of the lawlessness in Chechnya, I sent him to the U.S. because it seemed like the safest country at the time.\"[6]\nIn the United States, Todashev married an Armenian American, Reni Manukyan, who said she met him in 2010 through a mutual friend in Boston; Manukyan separated from Todashev in November 2012, but they had kept in regular contact with each other, and she was still supporting him with money.[7] Todashev was an amateur boxer before turning to mixed martial arts (MMA) in the United States, but he was to quit his professional MMA career due to a serious knee injury. His father said that after that, his son had held various jobs in the Boston area before eventually moving to Florida.[6]\nHis father said in an interview for Russia Today that his son was a \"very calm\" person who would never hurt anyone.[7] Todashev's former MMA training partner, however, described him as a gifted athlete but also a \"hothead\".[8] In 2010, the Boston Police Department detained Todashev for a violent road rage incident in Downtown Crossing; the police report states that the officers \"witnessed several people struggling to restrain a white male, later determined to be the subject, Ibragim Todashev. Officers heard Todashev yell, 'You say something about my mother, I will kill you!' Officers struggled to physically restrain and handcuff Todashev.\"[9] On May 4, 2013, shortly before his death, he was also briefly arrested by the Orange County Sheriff's Office in Orange County, Florida, after he got into a fight with two strangers during a dispute over a parking space at an outlet mall, knocking one of them unconscious and then leaving the scene (the man, who was hospitalized with serious head injuries but did not press charges,[1] later said he was shocked \"how accurate and quick his punches were\" and \"thought he was wearing brass knuckles, but it was just his fist\").[8] The responding sheriff's deputy chased down Todashev's car, ordered him out at gunpoint and arrested him; the affidavit states that \"Todashev said he was only fighting to protect his knee because he had surgery in March.\"[10]\nAt the time of the shooting that killed him, Todashev was free on $3,500 bail for the Orange County incident, facing charges of aggravated battery.[9][11][12] While his girlfriend had been ordered to return to Russia by an immigration judge, federal immigration officials granted her permission to stay in the United States for another year and released her from detention in August.[13] After speaking to reporter Susan Zalkind about Todashev's death and relationship with the FBI, she was arrested and deported to Russia in October 2013.[11] Todashev's friend who was also a housemate, Ashurmamad Miraliev, briefly charged in an unrelated case, was ordered to leave the country and left soon afterwards.[14][15]\nA triple murder was committed in Waltham, Massachusetts, on the evening of September 11, 2011.[18][19] Three men, Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman, and Raphael Teken, were murdered in Mess's apartment. All had their throats slit from ear to ear, with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. Illegal marijuana worth thousands of dollars was left covering their bodies, and $5,000 was left at the scene. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random.\nThe Boston Globe reported that Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the deceased suspect in the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, had once introduced murder victim Brendan Mess as his best friend.[18] After the bombings and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev's personal life, the Waltham murders case was reexamined in April 2013 with Tsarnaev as a new suspect.[6] Todashev's friendship with Tsarnaev then led to him being questioned for potential connection with the murders and other actions involving Tsarnaev.\n",

In 1990s, she met her husband, Vincent Fuillerat, with whom she had two children, Michael and Amanda. They separated in 2014 and that same year, Nall moved into the home of a colleague, Samara Routerberg, and lived there until her death.\nSamara L. Routerberg (27 December 1977 \u2013 24 February 2017) was an assistant principal and math teacher. She was born on December 27, 1977, in Harvey, Illinois to David and Kerri Routenberg. In 2010, she received a Magna Cum Laude master's degree at Nova University. She started to work in 2001 as a math teacher and soon after she worked in the Florida Department of Education.  Later on, she got a job as assistant principal at Lake Gibson Middle School in Lakeland, Florida, where she worked until her death.[4]\nVincente \"Vince\" P. Fuillerat (3 November 1963[5] \u2013 24 February 2017) was an electronic security consultant. He was born to Vincente Fuillerat Sr. and an unknown mother. Little is known about his life except that he married Lisa Heiler in the late 1980s or early 1990s, and had two children with her, Vincent Michael and Amanda Nicole.[citation needed]\nIn 2014, Lisa Fuillerat moved from her family home to Samara Routerberg's home located on Hickory Creek Drive in Brandon, Florida, a community close to Tampa. During that period, they began a hidden relationship.\nContemporarily, Fuilerat began divorce proceedings against her husband, but he declined to sign the proper documents or accept a formal divorce.\nOn October 2, 2015, Vincente Fuillerat entered Routerberg's home from the garage door. When Routerberg noticed his presence, she confronted him, and expelled him. Fuillerat left, but returned carrying an \"unknown blunt object\". He struck Routenberg's face several times, and slammed her head against the pavement.\nFuillerat was arrested and charged with aggravated battery and burglary. Because he did not have previous charges in Florida, he was sentenced to 36 months in probation and had to pay $6,040 for Routerberg's medical bills. Three days later, Routerberg signed an order of restriction.\nOn October 21, 2015, Lisa Fuillerat filed for a dissolution of marriage in Polk County. However, due to his opposition, the divorce process extended at least one and a half years more. During that time she and Routerberg acquired two pistols and began to practice at local shooting ranges.\nOn February 24, 2017, at around 6:30 as seen in the Routerberg vigilance cameras, Vincent Fuillerat broke into the couple's house wearing a bulletproof vest and armed with a shotgun. Both Nall and Routerberg noticed the entrance of the suspect, as alarms began to ring shortly after Fuillerat entered the premises. The Fuillerats and Routerberg began shooting for an undetermined period of time. The two women managed to wound Vincente Fuillerat several times, but were ultimately killed. Vincente Fuillerat then wrote a suicide note and killed himself.\nNext day, the three corpses were discovered, and as the letter depicted, Fuillerat's motives for killing were mainly jealousy and impotence. According to Fuillerat's attorney, Ralph Fernandez, in an interview with the New York Post \u2013 \"He felt the relation was immoral; He called it a lot worse than that. He said, \"I can't compete with that\".\"[6]\n",

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

He played professionally in the North American Soccer League and United Soccer League.\nFowles attended Long Island University-Brooklyn from 1972 to 1975 where he played forward on the men's soccer team.  He scored  24 goals over his four seasons with the team.\nIn 1976, he was taken by the Tampa Bay Rowdies as the 19th overall pick of the North American Soccer League draft.[1]  In 1977, the Fort Lauderdale Strikers signed Fowles for the team's first season.  He played with the team through 1983, its last season in Fort Lauderdale.  Over his seven seasons with the Strikers, he played 140 games and scored six goals.  After the Strikers moved to Minnesota in 1984, Fowles remained in Florida and played for the Fort Lauderdale Sun of the United Soccer League.  In 1985, the Sun was renamed the South Florida Sun, but the team and the league folded after only six games into the season.  Fowles was known as the fastest player in the NASL.  He once raced a quarterhorse over 80 yards and won.[2]\nFowles earned his first cap when he came on for Gary Etherington in a 2-1 victory over El Salvador on 15 September 1977.  He played all eight U.S. games that year at forward, but never found the net.   Beginning in 1978, the U.S. coaching staff moved Fowles to defense where he played all three games that year.[3]  He continued to play sporadically through 1979 and 1980 with his last cap coming in the last U.S. game of 1980.[4]  Fowled earned a total of 18 caps, between 1977 and 1980, but scored no goals.\nColin continued to live in the Coral Springs Florida area after playing professional soccer.  He coached St.Thomas Aquinas HS soccer team and played with the Lauderhill Men's Soccer Club.  On 28 August 1985, he was playing in the league championship at a Park in Miami and a gang war broke out behind the goal during the game. Multiple people were shot and killed right behind the goal. After the initial shooting was over, some of the assailants tried to blend in with the crowd outside the park as fans scrambled for safety. One of the men involved in the argument pulled a gun as Colin approached him and shot multiple times at Colin and missed. Colin jumped behind a telephone pole as the shooter approached the pole and shot Colin point blank in the midsection. The ambulance that came to take him the hospital had mechanical failure and another ambulance was dispatched. Later Colin was pronounced dead at the hospital. \nThe Florida Sun posthumously inducted Fowles into its Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\n",

Brazill (born September 22, 1986) is an American man who, at age 13, fatally shot one of his schoolteachers, Barry Grunow, at Lake Worth Middle School in Lake Worth, Florida. Brazill was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 28 years in prison.[2]\nOn May 26, 2000, the last day of the 1999\u20132000 school year, Brazill\u2014a seventh grade student\u2014shot and killed Barry Grunow, an English teacher at Lake Worth Middle School in Lake Worth, Florida. After being sent home from school earlier that day for throwing a water balloon, Brazill had returned home, retrieved a .25-caliber handgun, and shot Grunow.[2][3] Brazill was tried as an adult and convicted of second-degree murder for the killing of Grunow and aggravated assault for pointing the gun at another teacher.[4][3] The jury decided not to convict Brazill of first-degree murder, which requires premeditation and carries a mandatory life sentence in Florida, however, juveniles convicted of first-degree murder in Florida are given a review by a judge after 25 years.[3] Brazill was sentenced to 28 years in state prison followed by 7 years of probation.[2]\nPam Grunow, the widow of the murdered teacher, sued the Brazill family friend that owned the handgun used, the Palm Beach County School Board, and the pawn shop that sold the handgun. These cases were settled for over $1 million. Grunow also filed an action against the gun manufacturer that resulted in a $1.2 million jury verdict, but the trial judge set aside the verdict, and in 2005 the Florida District Court of Appeals upheld this ruling.[5][6]\nBrazill is incarcerated at the Jackson Correctional Institution with a release date set for May 18, 2028.[7] While imprisoned, Brazill earned his GED and certification as a paralegal.[8]\nAs a child, Brazill was surrounded by domestic abuse and alcoholism at home, and local police frequently responded to calls from the Brazill residence.[9] Prior to the Grunow murder, however, Brazill received at least 2 D's as well as an F by Grunow himself, described by teachers as being mild mannered and likeable, and Grunow was his favorite teacher.[10]\n",

Modesto was serving in the United States Navy in the Vietnam War at the time of his son's birth. After leaving the Navy, where he had served as a chief petty officer, Modesto worked as a stockbroker.[7]\nIn his youth, Cunanan lived with his family in National City and attended Bonita Vista Middle School.[8] In 1981, his father enrolled him in The Bishop's School, an independent day school located in the affluent La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego. There Cunanan met his lifelong best friend, Elizabeth \"Liz\" Cote.\nAt school, he was remembered as being bright and very talkative, and testing with an IQ of 147.[9]\nAs a teenager, Cunanan developed a reputation as a prolific liar, given to telling tall tales about his family and personal life.[7] He was adept at changing his appearance according to what he felt was most attractive at a given moment.[7] Cunanan identified as gay in high school, when he began having liaisons with wealthy older men.[10] He was voted \"least likely to be forgotten.\"[11] After graduating from high school in 1987, Cunanan enrolled at the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego), where he majored in American history.[12]\nIn 1988, when Cunanan was 19, his father deserted his family and moved to the Philippines to evade arrest for embezzlement.[13] That same year, Cunanan had begun frequenting local gay clubs and restaurants, and his mother, who was deeply religious, learned about his sexual orientation. During an argument, Cunanan threw his mother against a wall, dislocating her shoulder. Later examination of his behavior indicates that he may have suffered from antisocial personality disorder, characterized by a lack of remorse and empathy.[14] In 1989, Cunanan dropped out of UC San Diego and settled in the Castro District of San Francisco, a center of gay culture, moving in with Cote and her boyfriend, Phil Merrill.[7]\nIn San Francisco, Cunanan continued his practice of befriending wealthy older men, and also reportedly began creating violent pornography.[7] He also socialized in the Hillcrest and La Jolla neighborhoods of San Diego, as well as in Scottsdale, Arizona, \"apparently living off the largesse of one wealthy patron or another.\"[10] Cunanan is also believed to have been dealing drugs, including prescription opioids, cocaine, and marijuana.[15][16] He used several aliases: Andrew DeSilva,[17] Lt. Cmdr. Andy Cummings, Drew Cunningham, and Curt Matthew Demaris.[18]\nCunanan allegedly first met fashion designer Gianni Versace in San Francisco in October 1990,[19] when Versace was in town to fit the costumes he had designed for the San Francisco Opera production of Richard Strauss's opera Capriccio,[20] although Versace's family has always denied that the two men ever met.[16] In December 1995, Cunanan met David Madson, a Minneapolis architect, in a San Francisco bar. They began a long-distance relationship shortly after, but Madson ended the relationship in the spring of 1996, telling friends he sensed something \"shady\" about Cunanan.[16][21] Cunanan told friends that Madson was the \"love of my life\".[13]\nIn September 1996, Cunanan broke up with Norman Blachford, a wealthy older man who had been hosting and financially supporting him.[16] He soon maxed out his credit cards.[11][20] Cunanan's close friend Jeffrey \"Jeff\" Trail, a former Naval officer working as a district manager for a propane delivery company in Minneapolis, had told his former roommate Michael Williams that Cunanan had resumed selling drugs.[22] Cunanan also was known to regularly consume these drugs, especially methamphetamine.[20]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nKate Barker (born  \nArizona Donnie Clark; October 8, 1873 \u2013 January 16, 1935), better known as Ma Barker (and sometimes known as Arizona Barker and Arrie Barker), was the mother of several American criminals who ran the Barker\u2013Karpis Gang during the \"public enemy era\" when the exploits of gangs of criminals in the Midwestern United States gripped the American people and press. She traveled with her sons during their criminal careers.\nBarker gained a reputation as a ruthless crime matriarch who controlled and organized her sons' crimes. J. Edgar Hoover described her as \"the most vicious, dangerous, and resourceful criminal brain of the last decade.\" She has been presented as a monstrous mother in films, songs, and literature. However, those who knew her insisted that she had no criminal role and also allege that Hoover created such accusations in order to excuse the FBI for her subsequent death in a shootout in 1935. Current reports as of 2022 are consistent that Kate Barker's role in her sons' crimes were falsely created by the media to increase newspaper and media sales margins.\nBarker was born Arizona Donnie Clark in Ash Grove, Missouri, the daughter of John and Emaline (Parker) Clark; her family called her \"Arrie\". In 1892, she married George Barker in Lawrence County, Missouri, and the couple had four sons: Herman (1893\u20131927), Lloyd (1897\u20131949), Arthur (1899\u20131939), and Fred (1901\u20131935). The 1910 to 1930 censuses and the Tulsa City Directories from 1916 to 1928 show that George Barker worked in a variety of generally low-paying jobs. From 1916 to 1919, he was at the Crystal Springs Water Co. In the 1920s, he was employed as a farmer, watchman, station engineer, and clerk. An FBI document describes him as \"shiftless\" and says the Barkers paid no attention to their sons' education, and they were all \"more or less illiterate\".[1]\nBarker's sons committed crimes as early as 1910, when Herman was arrested for highway robbery after running over a child in the getaway car. Over the next few years, Herman and his brothers were repeatedly involved in crimes of increasing seriousness, including robbery and murder. They were inducted into major crime by the Central Park gang. Herman died on August 29, 1927 in Wichita, Kansas, after a robbery and confrontation with police that left one officer dead. He shot the officer at point blank range in the mouth. He killed himself to avoid prosecution when he was seriously wounded after crashing his car. In 1928, Lloyd Barker was incarcerated in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, Arthur \"Doc\" Barker was in the Oklahoma State Prison, and Fred was in the Kansas State Prison.\nGeorge was last listed living with his wife in the 1928 Tulsa city directory. Either she threw him out, as some say, or he left when life became intolerable with his criminal family. According to writer Miriam Allen deFord, George \"gave up completely and quietly removed himself from the scene\" after Herman's death and the imprisonment of his other sons.[2] The FBI claimed that George left Ma because she had become \"loose in her moral life\" and was \"having outside dates with other men\". They noted that George was not a criminal, but he was willing to profit from his sons' crimes after their deaths by claiming their assets as next of kin.[1] However, a family friend recalled that the couple argued about their children's \"dissolute life\". Arrie \"countenanced their wrongdoings\" while George refused to accept them. The crunch came when George refused to support Lloyd after his arrest, insisting that he should be punished for his crime. Arrie did everything that she could to get her sons off, no matter what they had done.[3]\nFrom 1928 to 1930, Ma lived in \"miserable poverty\" in a \"dirt-floor shack\" with no husband and no job, while all her sons were in jail. This may have been when she became \"loose\" with local men, as the FBI suggested.[3] By 1930, she was living with a jobless man named Arthur W. Dunlop (sometimes spelled \"Dunlap\"). She is described as his wife on the 1930 census of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Things improved for her in 1931 after her son Fred was released from jail. He joined former prison-mate Alvin Karpis to form the Barker\u2013Karpis Gang. After a series of robberies, Fred and Karpis killed Sheriff C. Roy Kelly in West Plains, Missouri on December 19, 1931, an act that forced them to flee the territory. Ma and Dunlop traveled with them, using various false names during their itinerant crime career. A wanted poster issued at this time offered $100 reward for the capture of \"Old Lady Arrie Barker\" as an accomplice.[4] After this, she was usually known to gang members as \"Kate\".\nArthur was released from prison in 1932 and joined Fred and Karpis, and the core gang was supplemented by other criminal associates. The gang moved to Chicago but decided to leave because Karpis did not want to work for Al Capone. Racketeer Jack Peifer suggested that they move to St. Paul, Minnesota which had a reputation at the time as a haven for wanted criminals.[4] The Barker\u2013Karpis Gang's most infamous crimes were committed after the move to St. Paul, during their residency in a string of rented houses. The gang operated under the protection of St. Paul's police chief Thomas \"Big Tom\" Brown, and they went from being bank robbers to kidnappers under his guidance.[5]\nMa's common-law husband Arthur Dunlop was said to be loose-lipped when drunk, and he was not trusted by members of the gang; Karpis described him as a \"pain in the ass\".[6] While at one hideout, a resident identified the gang from photographs in True Detective magazine and told the police, but Chief Brown tipped them off and they escaped. The gang apparently believed that Dunlop's loose lips had given them away, and they murdered him while traveling. His naked body was found near Webster, Wisconsin with a single bullet wound to the head.[6] Chief Brown's involvement in the gang's escape could not be proven, but he was demoted to the rank of detective and was later dismissed from the police force altogether.[7]\n",

Lewis, made a 911 call stating that she had found her daughter in the family's pool and she was not breathing.[2] Emergency personnel rushed Adrianna to the nearby hospital Bay Medical,[3] where she was pronounced dead about an hour after arrival. The death was initially treated as an accident until Adrianna's half-brother A.J., then 6 years old, told police that he had witnessed his mother \"dunk\" Adrianna in the pool as a form of corporal punishment.[4]\nDuring the investigation, police discovered that Adrianna had been diagnosed with ADHD and Lewis stated that while she initially had trouble bonding with her daughter, her affection for Adrianna had grown over time.[4] Investigators also found that neither Adrianna nor A.J. appeared to have any toys in the house, to which Lewis stated that the toys had been taken away for a week as a form of punishment and that the toys were stored in a shed. After searching the shed, investigators noted that there were no toys in the shed or any evidence to suggest that they had been there. There was a little red wagon and two inflatable toys for the pool in the yard but no other toys.[4] Dr. Renee Fox, the emergency room physician who had handled Adrianna's medical care, informed investigators that Lewis had not shown any emotion or reaction when informed that her daughter had died, which she had found odd.[3] Lewis submitted to and passed a lie detector test where she claimed that she had not killed her daughter.[5][4] In September 2007, Lewis was arrested and charged with the first-degree murder of Adrianna.[6] She was offered a plea bargain that would have required her to plead guilty to manslaughter and receive a ten-year sentence, which she declined in favor of going to trial.\nLewis went to trial in February 2008,[7] where the statements by A.J. and Dr. Fox were brought up as evidence and the defense argued that A.J. was not a reliable witness, as his story had changed several times during further questioning.[8] Other evidence brought to trial included an autopsy performed by Dr. Charles Siebert, statements from Lewis's co-workers, evidence of poor housekeeping, and the lack of toys, including Lewis's statement over the toys' whereabouts.[9] The prosecution also pointed out multiple bruises on Adrianna's forehead that correlated with A.J.'s testimony.[4] Four days after the case went to trial and after only two hours (including lunch) of deliberation, the jury found Lewis guilty of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.[10] In March of the same year, Lewis was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[8]\nIn 2010 Lewis filed an appeal, referring to the Merger doctrine, which she claimed \"precludes the use of aggravated child abuse as the underlying felony in a felony murder charge if only a single act of abuse led to the child's death\". This appeal was unsuccessful, and the conviction was affirmed.[11]\nThree television shows have highlighted this case: the Investigation Discovery show True Crime with Aphrodite Jones, an episode of 20/20, What A.J. Saw: Mother's Fate Hinged on 7-Year-Old's Testimony,[4][9] and also an episode of the UK documentary series Killer Women with Piers Morgan.[12]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJames Edward \"Pop\" Pough (February 16, 1948 \u2013 June 18, 1990) was an American spree killer who killed thirteen people in two separate attacks in Jacksonville, Florida on 17 and 18 June 1990. Pough shot and killed two people at random on Jacksonville\u2019s Northside, wounded two teenagers, and robbed a convenience store. Pough shot and killed nine people and wounded four others at a General Motors Acceptance Corporation (now Ally Financial) car loan office the next day before committing suicide.\nAt the time, the shooting at the GMAC office was the deadliest single mass shooting committed by a lone gunman in Florida history, surpassing the murder of eight machine shop employees in Hialeah by Carl Robert Brown on August 20, 1982.[2]\nJames Edward Pough was born on February 16, 1948, in Jacksonville, Florida, the first of nine children. Pough grew up in an area near Florida Community College at Jacksonville. As a child, Pough suffered from asthma and he had a close relationship with his mother, whom he helped out a lot after his father left the family in 1959. He attended a vocational school, but dropped out in his sophomore year. At the age of 18, he began working as a common laborer, which he remained as until his death. During the last year of his life, he was doing construction maintenance at a brewery.\nAccording to former schoolmates, Pough had affiliations with street gangs during his time at school. He was arrested twice in 1965 for vagrancy, and twice again in 1966, once for attempted robbery and a second time for assault after he attacked a construction worker who owed him a quarter. In 1968, Pough was arrested for dangerously displaying a knife and was fined $75, and in July 1969, he was fined $10 after being charged for gambling. In 1970, he was arrested, but not prosecuted, for motor vehicle theft and vagrancy-prowling by auto.\nOn May 8, 1971, Pough got into an argument with his best friend, David Lee Pender, who had called his girlfriend a \"bitch\". In the following scuffle, Pough grabbed a .38-caliber revolver from his girlfriend's purse and shot Pender three times, who eventually died in a hospital. According to relatives, Pough never managed to get over the fact that he had killed his friend. Pough was initially charged with murder, though the charge was later reduced to manslaughter. In the end, he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and was sentenced to five years probation, but the judgment of his guilt was withheld by the court subject to the successful completion of probation.[3] It was also ruled that Pough should never be allowed to own a gun due to his violent behavior in the past, though this was never forwarded to police. As a result, Pough was not considered a felon and therefore was able to purchase several handguns, among them the R\u00f6hm RG-31 .38-caliber revolver he later used to commit suicide, which was registered with the police on June 4, 1979. In 1977, Pough appeared twice in court for charges of bad debt, and there was also an outstanding warrant for his arrest in a 1982 employment compensation fraud case.\nIn December 1988, Pough traded his old car for a 1988 Pontiac Grand Am, though he soon had difficulties to make his payments. As a result, the car was voluntarily repossessed by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation (GMAC) in January 1990. He received a bill for $6,394 (around $13,200 as of 2021) of outstanding fees in March, and again on April 6, which was the last contact between him and the office. About two months prior to the shootings, Pough purchased a Universal Brand M1 carbine at a local pawnshop.\nPough was living in a rundown duplex in Jacksonville's Northwest Quadrant at the time. He was known by his neighbors as a quiet and nice man who kept a regular and fixed schedule, but also as someone who would become angry fairly quickly and get engaged in enraged conversations, especially in matters concerning money and his car. Relatives described him as a recluse with no friends. After the death of his mother three years prior to the shootings, Pough was said to have emotionally changed for the worse, saying that he had nothing left to live for and arguing that he would \"take someone with him when he leaves this world\". Frequently, he had violent outbursts, which were directed against his wife, Theresa, and twice he threatened her by putting a gun to her head. In January 1990, they separated, as Theresa feared for her safety, and on March 2, she was granted an injunction that disallowed Pough to get in contact with her for a year. As a consequence, he withdrew even more and rarely socialized.[4][5][6][7][8]\nPough started his killing spree in the night of June 17, 1990, at about 12:50\u00a0a.m. Armed with his blanket-wrapped M1 Carbine and not far from his home, he walked up to a group of men standing at a street corner in the Northwest section of Jacksonville, and killed Louis Carl Bacon with two shots in the chest before fleeing. A couple of minutes later, he attacked Doretta Drake who was chatting with two other women in a vacant parking lot just two blocks from the first crime scene. After hitting Drake with his car, throwing her on the sidewalk, Pough stepped out of his Buick and killed her with a single shot to the head before driving away.\n",

        "paragraph": "Democracy Abroad, Lynching At Home: Racial Violence In Florida is a 2015 history book  by Tameka Bradley Hobbs that discusses how lynchings have changed in the United States, with a focus on the mid 20th century Florida lynchings of Arthur C. Williams, Cellos Harrison, Willie James Howard, and Jesse James Payne. The book won a 2015 Bronze Florida Book Award and the 2016 Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore Award from the Florida Historical Society.\nHobbs reviews how lynchings have been conducted in United States with a focus on four African American men and boys lynched in Florida between 1941 and 1945: Arthur C. Williams, Cellos Harrison, Willie James Howard, and Jesse James Payne.[1] Hobbs argues World War II shifted public opinion and behavior in the United States, leading to private mob violence against African Americans instead of public lynchings, and to what Hobbs describes as \"legal lynchings.\"[1]\nIn a review for The Journal of American History, W. Fitzhugh Brundage writes \"Tameka Bradley Hobbs makes a convincing argument that these lynchings reveal important insights into the evolution of white supremacy in twentieth-century America.\"[2] In a review for the Journal of Southern History, Mari N. Crabtree writes that Hobbs \"provides valuable insights into the devastating impact of lynching on African American families and communities over the past seventy-five years. With so much of the literature on lynching focused on white southerners, her interviews with African American survivors provide a poignant and, at times, gut-wrenching glimpse into the intergenerational trauma of lynching.\"[1]\nHistorian Michael Hoffmann writes in a review for The Florida Times-Union, \"An important insight of 'Democracy Abroad, Lynching at Home' is the long-term psychological damage suffered by blacks who experienced white violence during the Jim Crow era.\"[3] In a review for The Florida Historical Quarterly, Billy Townsend writes, \nIn a review for The American Historical Review, Michael J. Pfeifer writes, \"Some scholars of lynching (and this includes my own work) have not focused sufficiently on the responses of African Americans to white mob violence, and Hobbs offers an extremely useful example of how fully incorporating the black response presents a more comprehensive and accurate analysis of the context for these events.\"[5] Brandon T. Jett writes in a review for H-Net Reviews in the Humanities & Social Sciences that \"Hobbs's most important contribution [...] rests in her examination of the short- and long-term effects of lynchings on black communities, and how World War II fundamentally shaped many Americans' and the federal government's response to lynchings.\"[6]\n",

Smith in Florida in February 2004. Smith was on probation at the time of Brucia's murder, having been released from state prison thirteen months prior.\nThe amendment to existing law was intended to toughen parole rules for sex offenders and also notify non-custodial parents when there is criminal activity near their child's home. Partly for this reason, Joseph Brucia, the child's father, approved making the law in her name, although he concedes this law would not have applied to her specific case, since the charges for which Smith was on probation were not the sexual offenses the law would target.\nThe bill failed to pass before the end of the 2004 session. Harris committed to re-introduce the bill in 2005, but no further information has been made available.[2]\nJoseph Smith, age 55, was found dead in prison on July 26, 2021, while awaiting his execution. His cause of death has yet to be released.[3]\nCarlie Jane Brucia (March 16, 1992 \u2013 February 1, 2004) was sexually battered and murdered by Joseph P. Smith (March 17, 1966 \u2013 July 26, 2021)[4] after being kidnapped from a car wash near her home in Sarasota, Florida, United States, on February 1, 2004, while returning from a friend's house. She was reported missing by her parents within half an hour of her abduction.\nThe kidnapping case became famous after a surveillance video showing the girl surfaced. The video, taken from a security camera located behind a car wash, shows Brucia being confronted by a man, later identified as Smith, who then grabbed her arm and led her away toward a car that was spotted on another camera. The video was shown nationwide and spurred a massive manhunt for the abductor.\nOn February 6, police announced that Smith, a 37-year-old father of three and car mechanic with a long list of arrests for drug-related charges and one for kidnapping and false imprisonment, was in custody as the primary suspect. In the same announcement, the police confirmed that Smith's car was involved in the crime.\nThe story gained national media attention in large part because Brucia's abduction was recorded by a surveillance camera. The tape shows her being approached by a man who seemed to be in his late 20s or early 30s. They apparently had a short conversation, after which he grabbed her by the arm and took her away. The FBI and NASA joined in the efforts to find Brucia and the man seen with her on the videotape. NASA researchers used advanced image processing technology to enhance the recording by reducing image jitter.\nAt least two informants called police, having recognized Smith from the television broadcasts of the security camera tape. Smith was already in custody at the time, having been arrested on February 3 on an unrelated parole violation. Smith refused to speak with investigators about Brucia's abduction until February 5, when he revealed where he had hidden her body, behind a nearby church.\n",

He had poor self-esteem, was socially reclusive, and he eventually developed an obsession with Bj\u00f6rk in 1993, hoping to be engaged with her; he was particularly angry over her brief relationship with the English musician Goldie.

However, he did not seriously pursue an artistic career due to his feelings of inferiority, and fear of being rejected entry into art school.[2][3] He intermittently worked for his brother's pest control business to support himself.[1][2] By the age of 17, L\u00f3pez had become reclusive and, as a means of escape, retreated into a world of fantasies and became enthralled by celebrities.[1][2]\nIn 1993, L\u00f3pez became fixated on the Icelandic singer Bj\u00f6rk.[1] He began gathering information about her life, followed her career, and wrote her numerous fan letters.[3] Initially, L\u00f3pez cited her as his muse and said that his infatuation gave him a \"euphoric feeling\".[2] As time passed, his fixation became all-consuming and he grew more disconnected from reality.[2] In his diary, L\u00f3pez wrote of longing to be accepted by Bj\u00f6rk and to be a person who had \"an effect on her life\".[3] He fantasized about inventing a time machine to travel to the 1970s and befriending her as a child.[3] His fantasies about Bj\u00f6rk were not sexual; in his diary, he wrote, \"I couldn't have sex with Bj\u00f6rk because I love her.\"[3]\nL\u00f3pez's diary grew to 803 pages, with passages about his thoughts on Bj\u00f6rk and his feelings of inadequacy due to being overweight, his disgust and embarrassment about his gynecomastia, and his inability to get a girlfriend.[2][3] He wrote that he considered himself \"a loser who never even learned to drive\" and complained about his menial job as an exterminator that earned little money.[3]  The diary contained 168 references to L\u00f3pez's feelings of failure, 34 references to suicide, and 14 references to murder.[3] He made 408 references to Bj\u00f6rk and 52 references to other celebrities.[3][5]\nIn 1996, L\u00f3pez was living alone in an apartment in Hollywood, Florida. Around this time he read in Entertainment Weekly that Bj\u00f6rk was in a romantic relationship with the English musician Goldie.[1][2][6] L\u00f3pez was angered by this perceived betrayal and the fact that she was involved with a black man, writing in his diary: \"I wasted eight months and she has a fucking lover.\"[7] He began fantasizing about how he could \"punish\" Bj\u00f6rk.[7]\n",

        "paragraph": "On March 10, 1993, Dr. David Gunn was fatally shot by anti-abortion extremist Michael Frederick Griffin in Pensacola, Florida.  It was the first documented killing of an obstetrics and gynaecology doctor where the stated intention of the perpetrator was to prevent a doctor from performing abortions in an act of anti-abortion violence in the United States.[1]\nA jury deliberated three hours before finding Griffin guilty on March 4, 1994. He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, which he is serving at Okaloosa Correctional Institution in Crestview, Florida.[2] In November 2017, the Florida Commission on Offender Review set Griffin's tentative release date for March 4, 2043. Griffin can seek a review of his release date in 2024, and additional reviews after no more than 7 years.[3][4]\nDavid Gunn (November 16, 1945 \u2013 March 10, 1993)[5] was an American physician. He received his bachelor's degree from Vanderbilt University and earned his M.D. at the University of Kentucky. Gunn moved to Brewton, Alabama, after his residency, choosing to provide OB/GYN and abortion services in the rural United States.\n Michael Frederick Griffin was 31 years old at the time of the shooting. The New York Times described Griffin as \"a fundamentalist Christian and a loner with a bad temper\".[6]\nOn March 10, 1993, anti-abortion protesters had been demonstrating in front of Gunn's Pensacola Women's Medical Services clinic.  Griffin waited outside, then ambushed Gunn by shooting him three times in the back with a shotgun, shouting \"Don't kill any more babies\" before opening fire.[7] Griffin did not deny his actions after shooting Gunn and told police \"We need an ambulance.\"\nGriffin claimed to be acting on behalf of God.[8] During his trial, Griffin's lead defense attorney, Robert Kerrigan, argued that anti-abortion activist John Burt had brainwashed Griffin and drove him to commit murder.[9] At the time, Burt was the Northwest Florida regional director of the national pro-life group Rescue America.[9] Burt was also a former member of the Ku Klux Klan[9] and self-professed \"spiritual adviser\" to a group of activists who bombed three abortion clinics in 1984.[9] A jury deliberated three hours before finding Griffin guilty on March 4, 1994.\nThe murder was one of the motivating factors in the passing in 1994 of the federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.[10] From March 1993 through May 2009, Gunn was the first of a total of four doctors murdered by anti-abortion extremists. Others killed were doctors Barnett Slepian, John Britton and George Tiller. Gunn's murder helped lead to the passage of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.[6] Gunn's murder also prompted Paul Jennings Hill to issue the Defensive Action Statement,[11] signed by 30 anti-abortion leaders, which stated their belief that the killing of doctors who perform abortions was justified.[12] Hill went on to murder physician John Britton and Britton's bodyguard in 1994.\nIn 1994, Gunn's murder inspired the first official single \"Get Your Gunn\" by alternative metal band Marilyn Manson. The lead singer, Marilyn Manson, explained in a 1999 Rolling Stone op-ed piece on the Columbine High School Massacre, that to him, Gunn's murder by \"pro-life\" activists was the ultimate hypocrisy he had witnessed as a young adult.[13]\n",

The crime scene was described as \"very complicated\" by the FBI special agent in charge.[1] The president of Miami-Dade's police union claimed that at least eleven officers opened fire on the UPS truck in response to the robbers' firing first.[2]\nAt approximately 4:14 p.m., Lamar Alexander and Ronnie Jerome Hill robbed the jewelry store, Regent Jeweler at Miracle Mile in Coral Gables, Florida.[3] They held the store's cashier at gunpoint and stole diamonds. The two suspects exchanged gunfire with the store owner during the robbery,[4] injuring one jewelry shop worker and hitting nearby Coral Gables City Hall with a stray bullet, causing that building to be placed on lock down.[5][6]\nPolice were alerted when the store's silent alarm system went off. Ninety seconds later, when officers arrived, the gunmen opened fire on the officers, who then returned fire on the gunmen. The gunmen left in a U-Haul van, which they later ditched in a suburban neighborhood one mile away.[7] The suspects then carjacked a UPS delivery truck at gunpoint and took the driver hostage. The two continued their escape in the UPS truck, heading on Interstate 75 into Broward County.[5]\nSeveral police cars pursued the suspects until the UPS truck became boxed in by slow-moving rush hour traffic in Miramar, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) north of the jewelry store.[8] Police then took cover behind the cars containing bystanders and later claimed the suspects opened fire first[8] however, the lawyer representing the two innocent victims of the shooting cites witness testimony that the police shot first.[9] A total of nineteen officers fired at the suspects, including thirteen members of the Miami-Dade Police Department. The other six officers were from the Miramar Police Department and the Pembroke Pines Police Department.[10] The pursuit and shootout were broadcast live on television by news helicopters.[8]\nFour people were killed in the shootout. Both robbery suspects,  Lamar Alexander, and Ronnie Jerome Hill, both 41, were killed by police. The hijacked UPS driver, Frank Ordonez, 27, and bystander Richard Cutshaw, 70, were also both killed in the shootout;[6] the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has not released the result of ballistics investigations that would indicate whether Ordonez and Cutshaw were shot by police or robbers.[11][12] A female store employee was shot and wounded in the initial robbery.[7][13]\nThe sister of Ordonez, who had been taken hostage, expressed her anger that the police responded quickly with gunfire, and did not attempt to negotiate the hostage situation, which she believed caused her brother's death.[13]\nAt a vigil the following year, Ordonez's brother said \"The police murdered my brother on live TV and we all had to watch in horror.\"[14] Lawsuits were later filed on behalf of Ordonez and Cutshaw, alleging that the police agencies involved had behaved negligently.[15] The litigation stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[15] Florida Department of Law Enforcement finished their investigation on Sept 17, 2021, and turned it over to  the Broward state attorney\u2019s office.[16]\n",

These events led to his arrest and conviction for 9 counts of first degree murder in the mid 1980s which he received the death penalty for, and ultimately his execution in December 2012.[1]\nPardo was born in New York. According to USA Today, Pardo Who was a former Boy Scout and Marine Corps veteran, Who began his law enforcement career in the 1970s with the Florida Highway Patrol, graduating at the top of his class at the academy.  He was fired from that agency in 1979 for falsifying traffic tickets. He was soon hired by the police department in Sweetwater, a small city in Miami-Dade County.\"[3][1]\nAfter some brushes with law enforcement, including one incident involving lying to investigators, his position at the Sweetwater Police Department was terminated. Pardo became involved in the drug trade and, in January 1986, Pardo killed his first two known victims, Mario Amador and Roberto Alonso, with a .22 caliber Ruger pistol during a robbery[2][1]\nLater that month, he killed Michael Millot, a Haitian anti-Duvalier activist, who Pardo believed to be a police informant.[1] Millot was a gunsmith who had previously supplied Pardo with silencers for his handguns.[1] Rolando Garcia lured Millot to the car of Pardo\u2019s wife, where Pardo himself was already waiting in the back seat.  Once Michael Millot arrived and entered the front passenger seat of the car, Pardo fatally shot Millot in the head with a 9mm pistol.[1] The car was later discovered to have been reupholstered after blood was cleaned out of it.[2][1]\nIn February 1986, he killed Luis Robledo and Ulpiano Ledo during a robbery of their home.[1] Pardo had four victims in April 1986 in two separate incidents: Fara Quintero and Sara Musa were killed over an argument about a pawned ring worth $50[1] and for refusing to buy Pardo a VCR with stolen credit cards. Pardo would later claim that he believed Quintero had marked him for death by dialing him number 8s on a pager, a numerical sign for death in the Santer\u00eda religion developed in Cuba.[2] Ramon Alvero and his girlfriend Daisy Ricard were shot to death as Alvero failed to show up to several drug deals.[1]\nPardo was apprehended in New York City, found in a hospital with a bullet in his foot that matched those found in his final victims.[1] The injury occurred when during the murder of Daisy Ricard, after shooting her once, Pardo\u2019s .22 Ruger pistol jammed, so he bludgeoned Ricard with the handgun, causing the jammed round to discharge into Pardo\u2019s foot.[1]\nPardo maintained until his death that his mission was to rid Florida of its drug culture by killing active sellers and buyers of drugs, admitting to at least six of the nine murders.[1]\nDuring his trial, against the advice of his attorneys, Pardo took the witness stand in his own defense. During this portion of the trial, Pardo claimed \"I am a soldier, I accomplished my mission and I humbly ask you to give me the glory of ending my life and not send me to spend the rest of my days in state prison.\"[4] Pardo \"acknowledged that he killed all nine victims, but claimed that all nine victims were drug dealers who had no right to live and that he was doing society a favor.\"[1] Prosecuting attorney David Waxman, on the other hand, maintained that Pardo was a \"cold-blooded killer\" and, according to the Clark County Prosecutor's site, \"The State presented the case that Pardo and Garcia were drug dealers and were eliminating the competition.\"[1][4]\nGarcia was convicted of four counts of first degree murder and sentenced to death. However, he won a new trial in 2002. Among other reasons, Pardo claimed Garcia had no involvement in the murders. Garcia later pleaded guilty to four counts of second degree murder, received a 25-year sentence, and was released from prison on September 5, 2002.[5][6]\n",

Her ex-boyfriend, Timothy \"Tracey\" Humphrey, and his wife Ashley Laney Humphrey, were convicted of her murder.\nTimothy Alvin \"Tracey\" Humphrey (born November 15, 1966)[1] was Sandee Rozzo's coworker at the time of her murder. They had previously been in a brief, but volatile relationship. He had committed an assault on Ms. Rozzo and criminal proceedings were in progress. The two had originally met at an Ybor City, Florida nightclub in November 2001 where Humphrey worked as a doorman and Sandee was a bartender.[2] Humphrey had a long previous criminal record of convictions for motor vehicle theft, kidnapping and aggravated assault.[1] The following February, Humphrey was arrested for felony battery after allegedly beating and sexually assaulting Sandee. He was due to go to trial on that charge on August 4, 2003, one month after Sandee's murder.[2]\nAshley Christine Humphrey (n\u00e9e Laney; born October 13, 1982)[3] was working at Planet Smoothie in Brandon, Florida when she met Tracey Humphrey at a local gym in 2002.[4] Ashley and Tracey married on July 4, 2003, one day before Sandee's murder.[4]\nOn July 5, 2003, Sandee Rozzo was shot to death in the garage of her Pinellas Park, Florida townhouse after returning home from her shift at the Green Iguana, a local bar.[2] Sandee's coworker Tracey Humphrey became the prime suspect.[5] Humphrey had an alibi however, claiming that he had ordered a pizza to his Brandon, Florida apartment at the time of the crime.[6] This was verified by an acquaintance, Tobe White. Further investigation however, revealed that his wife of one day, Ashley Humphrey, was not at home during the crime, as cell phone records indicated that Ashley was actually in Pinellas Park, Florida when Sandee was killed.[7] Ashley Humphrey was arrested for the first-degree murder of Sandra Rozzo and her husband Tracey Humphrey was charged with a federal firearms possession.[2] While she was in custody, Ashley Humphrey decided to cooperate with authorities. She had admitted that she shot Sandra Rozzo to death, but claimed it was at the behest of her husband. In her statement, she told vivid details about the plot to murder Sandee. In addition, she also gave up details regarding another failed murder attempt against Sandee. In a plea bargain, Ashley was allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against her husband. This gave prosecutors enough evidence to charge Tracey Humphrey with first-degree murder.[6]\nTracey Humphrey's murder trial began in February 2006. As part of her plea deal, Ashley testified against her husband. Under oath, she testified how she waited hours for Sandee to get off work at the Green Iguana, and then followed her back to her Pinellas Park home, where she fired eight shots into her.[7]  Tracey Humphrey testified in his own defense, stating that the killing was Ashley's idea.[8] The jury did not find him convincing. He was convicted of first-degree murder on February 25, 2006.[5] Even though he faced the death penalty, jurors opted for life without parole, believing that it would be a harsher punishment than death in this case.[9]\nTracey Humphrey is serving his sentence at South Bay Correctional Facility in South Bay, Florida, Inmate Number: 930490. Post-conviction, he was sentenced to an additional 15 years for a pre-trial escape attempt in April 2004.[1]\nOn March 10, 2006, Ashley Humphrey was sentenced to 25 years for murder.[9] She is currently incarcerated at the Gadsden Correctional Facility in Quincy, Florida, Inmate Number: 154362.  She is scheduled to be released from prison on December 13, 2028; she will be 46 years old.[3]\nThis case has been profiled from various perspectives on Dateline NBC, 48 Hours, Vengeance: Killer Lovers, Snapped, and On the Case with Paula Zahn; Ashley was interviewed by FBI profiler Candice DeLong for an episode of DeLong's Investigation Discovery series, Facing Evil. On 13 July 2017, Killer Woman was shown on ITV with Piers Morgan interviewing Ashley.[citation needed] Homicide: Hours to Kill, season two, episode nine, also covered the case.\n",

Officially convicted of two murders, Ables was later connected via DNA evidence to two other murders in 2006: of 84-year-old retiree Adeline McLaughlin in 1983, and his 31-year-old girlfriend Deborah Kisor in 1987. Despite their romantic involvement, Ables was not charged with Kisor's killing, and is yet to be tried for McLaughlin's.[1] He is currently serving a life sentence for killing another girlfriend, 48-year-old Marlene Burns, in 1990.[2]\nAbles' first murder occurred at age 15 in 1970, when he killed a man during a robbery in St. Petersburg. He was quickly arrested for that murder, and in March 1971 pled guilty to first-degree murder, receiving a life sentence. In 1983, after serving 12 years at a state prison, he was released on parole and got a job as a construction worker.[citation needed]\nFive months after his release, on June 25, he broke into the apartment of 83-year-old Adeline McLaughlin, a retired widow from Worcester, Massachusetts, by breaking through her window.[3] He suffocated McLaughlin with a pillow and then proceeded to burglarize her apartment.[4] The killing shocked the neighboring tenants, who knew Adeline as a mysterious yet friendly old lady.[3]\nOn Valentine's Day, 1987, Ables sexually assaulted and murdered his 31-year-old girlfriend at the time, Deborah Kisor, of Monterey, California.[5] She was last seen the previous day making a phone call from a payphone in front of an apartment building. Her body, dressed in only a blouse and a jacket, was found by a passer-by walking along a path near Roser Park bridge. She had bruises on her legs, with a blue pair of jeans laying beside the body. Despite being romantically involved with Kisor, Ables was not arrested as a suspect in her murder at the time.[6]\nOn June 4, 1990, after getting into a drunken argument with his new girlfriend and roommate, 48-year-old Marlene Burns, Ables pushed her down the stairs, beating and kicking her to death afterwards.[7] As he was leaving the apartment and wiping the blood off his hands, he was seen by witnesses, who had already called the authorities to report a domestic dispute.[8] When police arrived, they arrested Tony on the spot and soon charged him with first-degree murder, holding him without bail at the Pinellas County jail.[7]\nIn early June, Tony Ables was convicted of killing Burns and sentenced to die in the electric chair, but two years later, his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Justice Bob Barker. The reason for this was that Ables suffered from mental health issues, a claim that was corroborated by his brother Anthony, who said that their rocky childhood, in which their father abused their mother to the extent that she left the family, was a definite contributing factor.[2]\nThe McLaughlin and Kisor murders remained unsolved until 2006, when homicide detectives submitted Ables' DNA to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which matched with evidence found on both women's bodies. Ables was not charged with killing Kisor but officials consider the case closed. As for the McLaughlin murder, he was officially booked for it, but has yet to be charged.[1] According to Police Major Michael Puetz, there is a strong possibility that Ables could be responsible for other crimes, for which he has yet to be connected with.[9]\n",

She had brown hair and prominent cheekbones. She was between 5 feet, 2 inches and 5 feet, 5 inches in height. She had received extensive dental work, including numerous silver tooth fillings. She had a porcelain crown on one of her upper right teeth.[11][13][15]\nIt was determined that she had borne at least two children before her death.[10][17][18] One of her ribs had been fractured at the time of death, leading investigators to theorize that the killer had possibly knelt on her while he strangled her with the belt.[19]\nInvestigators initially believed the woman to be either of European or Native American ancestry. A further exhumation and examination of the remains, conducted in 2012, established that she was of European descent.[1][17] An examination of Harris lines in the victim's bones indicated that an illness or malnutrition had briefly arrested her growth in childhood.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Panama City  shootings occurred on December 14, 2010, in Panama City, Florida. In the attack, a disgruntled individual, Clay Allen Duke, fired four shots at six Bay District School board members, but missed them all, including the superintendent. Duke was then shot several times by Head of Safety and Security Mike Jones, a retired police officer, before committing suicide.[1]\nMuch of the episode and its immediate aftermath were recorded by local television news stations WMBB and WJHG-TV. The video was subsequently uploaded to video sharing sites, including YouTube.[2][3]\nAt 2:00\u00a0p.m. on December 14, 2010, Duke stood up during a school board meeting in Panama City, Florida, and said, \"I have a motion.\" He then promptly pulled out a can of red spray paint and sprayed a \"V\" inside a circle, as seen in the graphic novel V for Vendetta and film V for Vendetta. He then drew a 9mm Smith & Wesson 469 semiautomatic pistol, causing other staff near the bench and audience members to duck for cover. He aimed the gun at the board members and used it to point to two women, saying, \"You may leave, and you may leave...the women can leave...The six men stay, everyone else leave.\"\nAfter the room was evacuated, Duke told the board members he was upset that his wife had been fired from her job as an English teacher in the Panama City district. The superintendent, Bill Husfelt, after an approximately four-minute discussion, tried to negotiate with Duke, saying, \"I'm the only one who signs [the papers], will you let them [the other board members] go?\"[4] Duke denied his requests to allow the other board members to leave, saying, \"They're part of it.\"\nHusfelt then argued with Duke about his threat, saying, \"For what? [Referring to Duke's threat to kill himself] This isn't worth it.\" Duke raised the pistol and leveled it at the superintendent. Husfelt started to hold his arms to his chest, saying, \"Please don't, please don't, please...\" Duke fired, hitting the table in front of Husfelt, who dropped to the floor. The board members dived to the ground behind the desk. Duke then fired a second shot into the floor of the room, saying \"I'm going to kill you\", just as a responding security guard, Mike Jones, opened fire on Duke. After being hit by one of Jones' rounds, Duke fired two or three more times behind the table. Despite four or five shots being fired from Duke's gun, no board members were hit. He was shot again by Jones and fell to the ground. Duke blindly fired six more shots at Jones, then pointed the gun at his head and died by suicide. Jones was not injured, but was taken to the hospital for chest pains. According to his wife, Duke was an excellent marksman and likely missed his targets intentionally.[5] Jones later stated, \"I thought I'd let them down. I opened the door with one hand and was firing with the other. ...I don't know how I survived with all those shots fired.\" He also added, \"I'm not a hero, folks.\"\nMinutes after the shooting, WMBB uploaded the video to YouTube and other sites, where it received more than 1,000,000 views in less than a week.[3]\nClay Allen Duke (November 24, 1954 \u2013 December 14, 2010) was a 56-year-old unemployed Floridian who was apparently disgruntled over the firing of his wife by the school board. He was described by the Associated Press as a \"troubled, broke ex-con with bipolar disorder, an interest in anarchy, a wife whose unemployment benefits had run out and frustrations that reached their boiling point on a day circled on his calendar at home\".[6] Duke had previously been convicted of aggravated stalking and attempted ambush with a rifle in 1999 and 2000, respectively. While in prison, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder but was unable to afford treatment after his release. Although Duke was sentenced to five years in prison in 2000, he was released in January 2004, at which point he became a licensed massage therapist, according to state records.[5][7]\nThe economy and the world just got the better of him.\n",

        "paragraph": "Thomas Harrison Provenzano (June 6, 1949 \u2013 June 21, 2000) was a convicted murderer executed by lethal injection in Florida.  Provenzano said he believed himself to be Jesus Christ and also compared his execution with Christ's crucifixion.\nProvenzano was a 34 year-old unemployed electrician when, on January 10, 1984, he entered the Orange County courthouse in Orlando carrying a shotgun, an assault rifle, and a revolver, along with a large quantity of ammunition. He opened fire with the revolver when two bailiffs approached to search him.[1]\nProvenzano had been charged with disorderly conduct five months earlier and had gone to the courthouse with the intention of shooting the officer who had charged him.[2]\nInstead, he killed 60-year-old Deputy Sheriff William Arnold \"Arnie\" Wilkerson, a retired Navy Lt. Commander who had served 15 years with the Sheriff's Department. In addition, 53-year-old Deputy Sheriff Harry Dalton was wounded and suffered brain damage, becoming partially paralyzed and eventually dying from his injuries in 1991.[1]\n19-year-old Correctional Officer Mark Parker was hit in the spine and paralyzed from the neck down after being caught in the crossfire as he used his own body to shield a civilian from the gunfire.[3] Parker eventually died in March 2009 due to complications from his injuries. Provenzano would be found guilty and sentenced to death for the attack.[4]\nIn 1999, the state of Florida heard a petition from Provenzano that argued that the electric chair was a cruel and unusual punishment. During the proceedings, Michael Minerva, who had witnessed Jerry White's execution, said that \"White's body stiffened and was thrust upward and backward to the back of the electric chair\" after the current had been switched on.\nHe stated he heard air moving through White's lips and throat, though he could not tell whether the air was going in or out. But even after the execution by electric chair of Allen Lee Davis had caused many irregularities, the constitutionality of the electric chair remained upheld. However, by the time the inmate following Davis was to be executed, Florida inmates sentenced to death could choose between lethal injection and the electric chair.\nProvenzano was originally scheduled to be the second person executed in Florida's newly built electric chair on July 14, 1999, but the execution was stayed following the gruesome death of Allen Lee Davis six days before. Provenzano\u2019s eventual execution was carried out using a lethal injection protocol subsequently adopted by the Florida state legislature. Provenzano had spent almost 16 years on death row before being executed at Florida State Prison in Starke on June 21, 2000. He was the 48th murderer executed in Florida since that state's reintroduction of the death penalty in 1976.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn June 15, 2016, in the wake of a mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, launched a filibuster in the United States Senate, promising to hold the floor \"for as long as I can\" or until Congress acts on gun control legislation.[1]\nMurphy eventually secured a commitment from Senate leadership to hold a vote on two measures that he supports\u2014one to expand background checks and another to block suspected terrorists from purchasing weapons\u2014and ended his filibuster after 14 hours and 50 minutes, making it the tenth-longest filibuster in the U.S. Senate since 1900.[2]\nMurphy represents Connecticut in the Senate, where 20 schoolchildren and six educators were killed in December 2012 in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Murphy stated on the Senate floor during the filibuster, \"For those of us that represent Connecticut, the failure of this body to do anything, anything at all in the face of that continued slaughter isn't just painful to us, it's unconscionable.\"[3]\nMurphy was seeking a vote on legislation that would expand background checks required for weapons purchases, and on a measure sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California that would allow the U.S. to ban sales of guns and explosives to people listed on government watch lists of suspected terrorists. The Feinstein Amendment came to the Senate floor one day after 14 people were killed by Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik in the San Bernardino terrorist attack in December 2015, but failed on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed.[3]\nOn the day that Murphy began his filibuster, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said that he was in talks with Feinstein about possible compromise legislation on blocking gun sales to terrorism suspects. Separately, Everytown for Gun Safety, a pro-gun control group supported by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said that it was in compromise talks with Senator Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, who made a brief statement on the Senate floor in favor of some sort of bipartisan agreement.[3]\nMurphy began his filibuster at 11:21\u00a0a.m. EDT during a debate over an unrelated spending bill, and stated that his goal was to force the Senate and the United States House of Representatives to expand background checks of would-be gun purchasers, and to make it impossible for individuals listed on the FBI's various lists of suspected terrorism participants and no-fly lists to legally purchase guns from FFL holders.[4][5] As a Murphy spokesman put it, the Senator would \"hold the floor to push for a vote on amendments to close the terror gap and expand background checks.\"[1]\nUnder Senate rules, Murphy was permitted to yield for the purposes of taking questions while not yielding the floor; as in recent past filibusters, this allowed supporters of the filibuster to make speeches of their own which were nominally questions, temporarily relieving Murphy from having to constantly speak.[6] Murphy was joined over the course of the nearly 15-hour-long filibuster by 38 of his 45 fellow Senate Democrats.[6] Some, including Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Cory Booker of New Jersey, stood with Murphy for hours.[7] Other Democratic senators appearing on the floor included Bill Nelson of Florida,[8] Dick Durbin of Illinois,[9] Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York,[10] and Joe Manchin of West Virginia,[11] as well as Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.[8][12] Other Democratic senators joining the filibuster included Ben Cardin and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington, Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Tom Carper of Delaware, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, and Joe Donnelly of Indiana. Independent Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats, put questions as well.[13]\nTwo Republicans appeared on the floor to engage with Murphy with questions: first Ben Sasse of Nebraska[7][14] and then Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.[6]\n",

They know our message ... It's all leading up to the march ... Media trucks aren't lining our streets anymore, but people keep asking us for interviews. But we keep declining them. We don't want to over-saturate the media. We don't want people to get 'Oh, I'm sick and tired of these kids. So annoying.' And we also have school.Corin has made YouTube videos; one called \"WhatIf\" got 1.4 million views in  three days.[4] She has appeared on national television.[8]   In anticipation of the March for Our Lives, she appeared on the March 21 episode of the Rachel Maddow Show, along with Gonzalez and Sarah Chadwick.[9]  She spoke at a rally in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on March 29.[8] She, Gonzalez, Hogg, Kasky and Alex Wind are pictured on the third week of March's Time cover.[10]\nCorin criticized the NRA and gun manufacturers for touting the Ideal Conceal, a handgun that folds up to resemble a smart phone.[11] She faulted the NRA for \"enforcing the normality of shooting other people\"; further, she argued that police, confronting people including persons of color with smart phones, might believe that their phones were weapons, and shoot them on accident.[11]\n",

His 14-year-old daughter Alaina Petty was murdered in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on February 14, 2018.[1] Petty is credited with helping to pass the \"Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act\" Florida Senate Bill 7026 just three weeks after his daughter Alaina was murdered.[2][3] At the federal level, Petty worked with Senators Orrin Hatch, Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson to pass the STOP School Violence Act and the Fix NICS Act of 2017.[4] He has met frequently with Florida governor Rick Scott, and many federal lawmakers.\nRyan Petty ran for Broward County School Board in 2018, narrowly losing in the primary to incumbent Donna Korn. In an unusual turn of events, Petty was endorsed by two sitting U.S. Senators Orrin Hatch and Marco Rubio, unusual for a local school board race.[5]  Senator Rubio credited Petty for his work to improve school safety and his help in passing the STOP School Violence Act.[6]\nGovernor-elect of Florida Ron DeSantis, a Republican, included Petty on his Transition Advisory Committee on Public Safety.[7] In January 2020, Petty was appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis to the Florida State Board of Education.[8]  Petty was confirmed by the Florida Senate in March 2020.[9]\nIn February 2018, Ryan and his son Patrick Petty accompanied Governor Rick Scott to Tallahassee to speak to the Florida House and Senate about the impact to their family of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and the need for legislative reform targeted at improving school safety.  Petty spoke to both chambers asking them to set aside political differences to make our schools safe. \"If this evolves into a gun control debate, we are going to miss our opportunity to get something done,\" Petty said. \"[The] message is simple, this time must be different we have an opportunity to get our schools secure.\"[10] Petty has been praised for his ability to work across the aisle to tackle the issue of school shootings in the United States, meeting with lawmakers and other officials in Florida and Washington, D.C.[11]\nIn April 2018, Petty and his wife Kelly launched a nonprofit organization, The WalkUp Foundation; which is dedicated to improving the culture in our public schools by funding programs that influence engagement within the student body. The WalkUp Foundation also funds early identification & threat assessment programs, which has been demonstrated to help prevent acts of school violence. In partnership with the U.S. Secret Service and The Columbia Lighthouse Project[12] at Columbia University, The WalkUp Foundation is working to ensure that school districts are equipped with best practices and training for proactive threat assessment.\n",

        "paragraph": "James Dupree Henry (January 17, 1950 \u2013 September 20, 1984) was an American criminal who was executed in Florida for the murder of civil rights leader Zellie Riley.[1] Henry slashed Riley's throat during a robbery in Orlando on March 23, 1974. He also shot and almost killed Orlando detective Ronald E. Ferguson during his arrest five days later.[2] Notably, despite killing a civil rights leader, other civil rights leaders, namely Jesse Jackson and Coretta Scott King, attempted to stop Henry's execution. William Riley, Zellie Riley's son, also stated he did not want his father's killer to be executed.[3] On September 20, 1984, Henry was executed via the electric chair.[4][5][6]\nJames Dupree Henry was born in Orlando on January 17, 1950.[7] Growing up, he shifted among family members, and in later years said he was unsure as to whether or not he had any siblings. It was not until his murder conviction that he met his real mother.[8] In 1965, when Henry was 15 years old, he stabbed a 19-year-old man in Orlando's west side. He claimed the man was trying to rob him, but nevertheless Henry was forced to be housed at a boy's reformatory in Marianna, Florida, for a few months.[8]\nHenry was re-arrested in 1970, at age 20, for shooting and critically wounding a man. Once again Henry claimed it was self-defense, but the man said Henry tried to rob him. In jail, he was accused of attacking a jail supervisor.[8] In 1973, Henry took part in a prison fight, during which he suffered a knife wound to his left eye, causing him to permanently lose sight in that eye. Later that year Henry was released from prison.[8]\nZellie L. \"Z. L.\" Riley (April 1, 1892 \u2013 March 23, 1974)[9] was a prominent civil rights leader in Orlando. Born in Georgia[10] in 1892, he moved to the Orlando area in 1920, and became a member of the Mount Olive A.M.E. Church. In 1950, he founded the Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce (now known as the African American Chamber of Commerce).[10] In 1957, he was promoted as the chairman of the Negro division for the United Appeal campaign.[11] He also was behind several other projects to alter the view of African Americans of Orlando, such as a community center in Washington Shores. After his death, Z.L. Riley Park was opened in the neighborhood of Parramore.[12]\nOn Saturday, March 23, 1974, Henry broke into Riley's home at 422 Sunset Avenue. Henry, who had planned a robbery, attacked Riley, who was 81 years old at the time. Henry bound Riley, gagged him, slashed his throat open with a razor, then viciously beat him with his fists and a gun until he was sure Riley was dead.[13] Afterwards he scoured around the house and stole multiple valuables. He also took $64 of Riley's personal money.[13]\nThe following day, Sunday, March 24, Riley was expected to attend church with his nephew, but did not show up.[10] In a welfare check on his home, police found his body. Carl T. Langford, the mayor of Orlando during this time, spoke to the Orlando Sentinel on March 25. He said \"I've known Mr. Riley nearly 30 years. He was always concerned about Orlando and the people of Orlando, and, in his quiet, gentle way, he worked to bring about better conditions in the section where he lived and better understanding between segments of the community\".[10] A reward fund was started on March 26 to locate the killer.[14] Riley was buried at Washington Park Cemetery.[9] Henry was identified as the killer due leaving his fingerprints at the crime scene.[15]\nOn March 28, 1974, Ronald Eugene Ferguson, an award-winning Orlando detective, approached Henry to question him about the murder. When told he was going to get arrested, Henry attacked Ferguson and stole his gun. He then demanded Ferguson to get away from him. When Ferguson said no Henry shot him once in the upper chest and the lower right abdomen.[16] He then continued to beat him until backup arrived, and Henry was arrested. Ferguson was rushed to the hospital where he was treated for critical injuries. Ferguson ended up making a full recovery.[16]\nIn June 1974, a 12-member jury found Henry guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death days later.[17] He was housed at Florida State Prison to await his execution. He was first scheduled to be executed on December 6, 1979, after Florida governor Bob Graham signed to approve the execution.[18] When it was publicly announced that Henry was going to die, Riley's own son William, a taxi service owner in Orlando, publicly stated that his father loved peace and despised vengeance. William said he did not want Henry to be executed, and also said that his father would not want him executed either; \"This is not the way, a life for a life. My father taught me God gave life and only God can take life. We suffered as a family when he died, and we ask you not to add to our suffering by killing James Dupree Henry\".[3]\nSeven days before Henry was scheduled to be executed, Justice John Reed ordered to stop the execution due to an investigation on whether or not capital punishment was disproportionately used in Orange County.[19] In 1981, a federal court ruled that Henry would have to be re-sentenced by a new jury.[20] This was due to the testimony of Ferguson in Henry's trial, which the court ruled should not have been allowed.[20] However, this never ended up happening and Henry remained on death row. \n",

He became rich very quickly, reportedly hiring a chauffeured limousine to drive his monkey around.[7]\nIn 1980, Bolender murdered four men after a botched drug deal.[5][8] Bolender and two others, Joseph Macker and Paul Thompson, kidnapped the four victims and then robbed, tortured, and murdered them.[5] The bodies were hidden in a burnt car which was later found on Interstate 95 in Miami, Florida.[5] The victims were John Merino, Scott Bennett, Rudolfo Ayan, and Nicomedes Hernandez, who were all killed on January 8, 1980.[9]\nBolender, Macker, and Thompson were instant suspects. Macker made a deal with prosecutors for leniency in exchange for his testimony that Bolender was the instigator of the murders.[5] Bolender's fingerprints were found on the burnt car. Despite this, he maintained his innocence and claimed he was not involved in the murders.[5] Bolender stated that he was at home with his girlfriend during the killings.[8]\nBolender was convicted of the murders and sentenced to death in April 1980, just three months after the crime. Bolender's case was then appealed to the Supreme Court of Florida,[5] which affirmed his sentence in 1983.[5] A judge threw out his death sentence, ruling that Bolender's lawyer was ineffective as he presented no evidence in Bolender\u2019s favor during the penalty phase of his trial.[5] That ruling was reversed and the death penalty reinstated in 1987. Bolender then had another appeal for the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in 1990.[5]\nBolender was executed in the electric chair on July 18, 1995, in Bradford County, Florida. He was pronounced dead at 10:19\u00a0a.m.[5][10] He was executed at the Florida State Prison.[10]\n",

Her body was recovered two days later near Perry, Florida.[2]\nHoffman was under drug court supervision for possession of 25 g[3] (0.9 oz.) of cannabis discovered during a traffic stop on February 22, 2007.[4]  On April 17, 2008,[5] Tallahassee, Florida police searched her apartment and uncovered another 151.7 g (5.328 oz.) of cannabis,[3] and four ecstasy pills.  Hoffman faced a possible prison sentence if charged and convicted on criminal charges related to the discovered drugs. Police attempted to persuade her to identify other marijuana dealers to avoid the charges. She refused.  The police then pressured her to act as a confidential informant in a drug sting operation instead in exchange for not being charged with additional drug charges. The purported goal of the operation was to buy 1,500 ecstasy pills, 2 oz. of cocaine, and two handguns, which was contrary to department policy, using $13,000 cash in a buy\u2013bust operation.  Hoffman's family stated that all three buys were very out-of-character for her.\nTwo narcotics officers arranged for the drug buy at a specific location and were providing security for the buy. That was later deemed to be insufficient manpower to protect the informant and still apprehend the suspects.\nWhile she was at the drug buy, with the policemen monitoring, the two suspects changed the location of the buy.  She was informed not to follow the suspects to the new location, but technical issues prevented her from actually receiving the instructions. Her police handlers lost track of her when she agreed with the suspects to change the plans and left the buy spot with the two suspects in their stolen silver BMW. While in transit, the two suspects allegedly executed her with the gun she was supposed to buy.[6]\nAccording to police documents, a witness described seeing the BMW stuck in a ditch, with a 2005 Volvo belonging to Hoffman idling nearby, between 7 pm and 7:30 pm, about 30 minutes after the police lost track of Hoffman. The witness claimed that the BMW drove off when he stopped to help the driver try to get the car out of the ditch, but the vehicle later returned as the witness was leaving. The witness claimed he became suspicious and decided to leave when the driver of the Volvo opened the trunk and revealed a camouflage blanket and neat stacks of female clothing.\nDeneilo R. Bradshaw, 23, and Andrea Jabbar Green, 25, who were fired from their jobs at a window tint and car detailing shop just days before the incident, were charged with armed robbery in connection with the events leading up to Hoffman's death.[7]\nThe Tallahassee Police Department admitted that Hoffman had no training to work undercover, she did not know the two men targeted in the sting, and she had no experience with cocaine or firearms and very little with MDMA.[6] The officers involved in the operation were suspended with pay, and the family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city.\nThe two sellers were charged by a grand jury with first degree murder.[8] Details of the murder itself were not released at the time.\nHoffman's story garnered many news headlines including a page on the Tallahassee Democrat[9] website dedicated to information surrounding her death.\n20/20 covered the story on July 25, 2008, and Dateline NBC covered it on January 16, 2009.\n",

        "paragraph": "The 1986 FBI Miami shootout occurred on April 11, 1986, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, U.S. (the specific area was incorporated as Pinecrest in 1996), when a small group of field agents for the FBI attempted to apprehend William Russell Matix and Michael Lee Platt, who were suspected of committing a series of violent crimes in and around the Miami metropolitan area.\nAlthough they had partially surrounded the suspects after maneuvering them off a local road, the agents involved quickly found their firepower was outmatched by the weapons which Matix and Platt had in their vehicle. During the gun battle which ensued, Platt in particular was able to repeatedly return fire despite sustaining multiple hits. Two Special Agents died from their wounds, while five other agents were injured by gunfire. The shootout ended when both Matix and Platt were killed.\nThe incident is infamous as one of the most violent episodes in the history of the FBI and is often studied in law enforcement training. The scale of the shootout led to the introduction of more effective handguns, primarily switching from revolvers to semi-automatics, in the FBI and many police departments around the United States.\nMichael Lee Platt (February 3, 1954 \u2013 April 11, 1986) and William Russell Matix (June 25, 1951 \u2013 April 11, 1986) met while serving in the U.S. Army at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\nMatix first served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1969 to 1972, working as a cook (MOS 3371) in the officers' mess, serving in Hawaii and Okinawa from April 1970 to March 1971 and April 1971 to March 1972 respectively. He was honorably discharged July 7, 1972, achieving the rank of Sergeant. He enlisted in the U.S. Army on August 10, 1973, serving with the military police under the 101st Airborne Division in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. He served as a Military Police Officer and Squad Leader; Guard Supervisor for the Post Stockade and finally Patrol Supervisor before his honorable discharge August 9, 1976.[1]\nPlatt enlisted in the Army 27 June 1972 as an infantryman. While in basic training, Platt applied for Army Airborne Ranger Training and subsequently entered Air Assault School at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. On completion of air assault school, Platt was assigned to the Military Police Unit. It was in this unit that he met and served with Matix. This is also where he met his first wife, Regina Lylen. He was honorably discharged in 1979.[1]\nBoth men's former wives had died under violent circumstances.[2] Matix's wife, Patricia Mary (n\u00e9e  Buchanich) Matix, and a female co-worker, Joyce McFadden, both cancer researchers, were found stabbed to death on December 30, 1983, at Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, where both women worked.[3] Both were found murdered in the hospital laboratory. They had been bound and gagged with their throats slashed.[1] Matix reportedly told investigators he suspected Platt had carried on an affair with his wife. Matix was a suspect in the murders but was never charged.[4]\nAfter his wife's death, Matix moved to Florida at Platt's urging, and the two founded Yankee Clipper Tree Trimming Service, a landscaping and tree removal business.[5] In May 1985, Matix married Christy Lou Horne, who moved out of the house two months later when Matix became enraged after learning she was pregnant. She would give birth to their son after Matix's death.[6][7]\nOn December 21, 1984, Platt's wife, Regina, whom he had married nine years earlier in 1975, was found dead from a single shotgun blast to the mouth. Her death was ruled a suicide.[8] He married his second wife, Brenda Horne, in January 1985.[citation needed]\n",

His father Eddie died after committing multiple gunshot suicide on January 21, 1985, leading to Mike taking over his Championship Wrestling from Florida territory.[3] In the late 1980s, he would again team with Keirn and wrestled in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions (who he sold his father's territory to), with Keirn briefly around this time.[3] He then went back to the AWA in 1988, where he won the Light Heavyweight Title again.[3] In the following years, Graham & Keirn wrestled in Memphis as a tag team, and Graham went back to Florida to the newly renamed Florida Championship Wrestling, where he briefly teamed with Dustin Rhodes.\nGraham retired as an in-ring competitor in 1992.[7] He became a road agent for World Championship Wrestling. Along with the likes of Paul Orndorff, Pez Whatley and DeWayne Bruce, Graham also worked as a trainer in WCW as part of the WCW Power Plant.[7] At Slamboree 1993, Mike represented his late father when he was inducted into the WCW Hall of Fame. He was reportedly responsible for causing Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko, and Perry Saturn to leave the company for the WWF, granting their releases.[7] In the early 2000s, Graham was a road agent for the short-lived Xcitement Wrestling Federation and for Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling. Graham defeated his arch rival Kevin Sullivan at WrestleReunion 3 on September 10, 2005.[6] He made occasional appearances for the revived Florida Championship Wrestling. Mike Graham worked with World Wrestling Entertainment in early 2006, on a DVD about Dusty Rhodes, which was released on June 6, 2006.  He has appeared on WWE 24/7's Legends of Wrestling series as part of a panel which discussed famous pro wrestlers of the 1980s.[7] He hosted classic episodes of Championship Wrestling from Florida on WWE 24/7 Classics.[7]\nGraham's father was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008, with Mike representing his late father at the ceremony and the following night at WrestleMania XXIV.[6] Graham then competed in a Legends Battle Royal won by Roddy Piper for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla on January 29, 2011.[6] He also held a weekly radio show called Talking Wrestling with Mike Graham.[4] His former tag team partner Kevin Sullivan was the last ever guest in his radio show, recalling a chilling phone call where Mike was emotional and told Kevin he loved him; he killed himself six days later.[5]\nIn addition to his wrestling career, Graham also competed in offshore power boat racing. In 1993, Graham throttled Kiely Motorsports' 35' Offshore Class C catamaran to multiple championship finishes:\nGraham maintained position as the throttle man for each finish. He elevated the profile of powerboat racing nationally, and was known as a fierce competitor and a true sportsman.\nOn October 19, 2012, Graham was found dead by his wife of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at their residence in Daytona Beach, Florida during Biketoberfest.[8] His father and son had committed suicide in similar manners on January 21, 1985, and December 14, 2010, (some sources state the 15th)[4] respectively.[8][7] He was 61 years old.[9] At the time of Mike\u2019s death, he was wearing his son\u2019s old work boots, and also frequently threatened committing suicide to his wife.[5] He was also intoxicated, and according to his toxicology report, Graham's blood-alcohol concentration was at 0.259.[9]\n",

As of the 2020 census, the population was 47,319.[1] Its county seat is Marianna.[2]\nJackson County was created by the Florida Territorial Council in 1822 out of Escambia County, at the same time that Duval County was organized from land of St. Johns County, making them the third and fourth counties in the Territory. The county was named for Andrew Jackson, a General of the War of 1812, who had served as Florida's first military governor for six months in 1821.[3] Jackson County originally extended from the Choctawhatchee River on the west to the Suwannee River on the east. By 1840 the county had been reduced close to its present boundaries through the creation of new counties from its original territory, following an increase of population in these areas. Minor adjustments to the county boundaries continued through most of the 19th century, however.[4][5][6]\nThere were no towns in Jackson County when it was formed. The first county court met at what was called \"Robinson's Big Spring\" (later called Blue Springs) in 1822 and then at the \"Big Spring of the Choctawhatchee\" in 1823. The following year the county court met at \"Chipola Settlement\", which is also known as Waddell's Mill Pond.[citation needed]\nEuropean Americans developed this area of Florida as part of the plantation belt in the antebellum years. Cotton was cultivated as a commodity crop by large workgangs of enslaved African Americans, and Florida became a slave society.\nGradually towns were developed. In January 1821, Webbville had been established as the first town in Jackson County. It was the first designated as the county seat. Marianna was founded in September 1821 by Robert Beveridge, a native of Scotland. It developed about 9 miles (14\u00a0km) southeast of Webbville. About 1828, Beveridge and other Marianna settlers went to Tallahassee to lobby the state legislature to move the county seat to Marianna.\nThey enticed the Florida Legislature with offers of free land, locally paying for construction of a county courthouse and development of a related public square, and donating an additional $500 to purchase a quarter section of land to be sold at public auction as a way to finance the new government, if the county seat was moved to Marianna.[7] Beveridge and his supporters succeeded in their civic bribe. Marianna became the de facto county seat of the county justice and civil authority, although it was never officially proclaimed as such. Marianna began to grow and prosper when the county government moved into the new courthouse in 1829. It became the market and court town for the rural county.\nWebbville's prominent citizens moved to Marianna to follow the courts, as did numerous businesses.

        "paragraph": "\nOn February 14, 2018, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Miami suburban town of Parkland, Florida, murdering 17 people[note 2] and injuring 17 others.[2][3][4] Cruz, a former student at the school, fled the scene on foot by blending in with other students, and was arrested without incident approximately one hour later in nearby Coral Springs.[5] Police and prosecutors investigated \"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\".[6]\nThe killing spree is the deadliest high school shooting in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre that killed 15, including the perpetrators, in Colorado in April 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nTheodore Robert Bundy (born Cowell; November 24, 1946\u00a0\u2013 January 24, 1989) was an American serial killer who kidnapped, raped and murdered numerous young women and girls during the 1970s and possibly earlier. After more than a decade of denials, he confessed to 30 murders committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. His true victim total is unknown and likely significantly higher.[6]\nBundy was often regarded as charismatic and handsome, traits he exploited to win the trust of both his victims and society as a whole. He would typically approach his victims in public places, either feigning a physical impairment such as an injury, or impersonating an authority figure, before bludgeoning them into unconsciousness and taking them to secondary locations to be raped and strangled. Bundy often revisited his victims, grooming and performing sexual acts with the corpses until decomposition and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. At least twelve of his victims were decapitated and their severed heads kept as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, he broke into homes at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.\nIn 1975, Bundy was arrested and jailed in Utah for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault. He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in several states. Facing murder charges in Colorado, Bundy engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults in Florida, including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in 1978. For the Florida homicides, he received three death sentences in two trials. Bundy was executed at Florida State Prison in Raiford on January 24, 1989.\nBiographer Ann Rule characterized him as \"a sadistic sociopath who took pleasure from another human's pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death and even after.\"[7] Bundy once described himself as \"the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you'll ever meet,\"[8][9] a statement with which attorney Polly Nelson, a member of his last defense team, agreed. \"Ted,\" she wrote, \"was the very definition of heartless evil.\"[10]\nTed Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946, to Eleanor Louise Cowell (1924\u20132012, known by her middle name) at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers[11] in Burlington, Vermont. His biological father's identity has never been confirmed; his original birth certificate apparently assigns paternity to a salesman and United States Air Force veteran named Lloyd Marshall,[12] though a copy of it listed his father as unknown.[13] Louise claimed she met a war veteran named Jack Worthington,[14] who abandoned her soon after she became pregnant.[15] Census records reveal that several men by the name of \"John Worthington\" and \"Lloyd Marshall\" lived near Louise when Bundy was conceived.[16] Some family members expressed suspicions that Bundy might have been fathered by Louise's own father, Samuel Cowell.[17] In the 2020 documentary film Crazy, Not Insane, psychiatrist Dorothy Otnow Lewis claimed she received a sample of Bundy's blood\u2014though she did not specify from where\u2014and had arranged a DNA test which confirmed that Bundy was not the product of incest.[18]\nFor the first three years of his life, Bundy lived in the Philadelphia home of his maternal grandparents, Samuel (1898\u20131983) and Eleanor Cowell (1895\u20131971), who raised him as their son to avoid the social stigma that accompanied birth outside of wedlock at that time. Family, friends, and even young Ted were told that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister. Bundy eventually discovered the truth, although his recollections of the circumstances varied; he told a girlfriend that a cousin showed him a copy of his birth certificate after calling him a \"bastard,\"[19] but he told biographers Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth that he had found the certificate himself.[13] Biographer and true crime writer Ann Rule, who knew Bundy personally, wrote that he did not find out until 1969, when he located his original birth record in Vermont.[20] Bundy expressed a lifelong resentment toward his mother for never talking to him about his real father, and for leaving him to discover his true parentage for himself.[21]\nBundy occasionally exhibited disturbing behavior at an early age. Louise's younger sister Julia recalled awakening from a nap to find herself surrounded by knives from the kitchen, and three-year-old Ted standing by the bed, smiling.[22] Bundy's childhood neighbor Sandi Holt described him as a bully, saying, \"He liked to terrify people... He liked to be in charge. He liked to inflict pain and suffering and fear.\"[23]\nIn some interviews, Bundy spoke warmly of his grandparents[24] and told Rule that he \"identified with,\" \"respected,\" and \"clung to\" his grandfather.[25] In 1987, however, he and other family members told attorneys that Samuel was a tyrannical bully who beat his wife and dog, exhibited bigotry (including religious intolerance, racism, and xenophobia), and swung neighborhood cats by their tails. In one instance, Samuel threw Julia down a flight of stairs for oversleeping.[26] He sometimes spoke aloud to unseen presences,[27] and at least once flew into a violent rage when the question of Bundy's paternity was raised.[26] Bundy described his grandmother as a timid and obedient woman who periodically underwent electroconvulsive therapy for depression[27] and feared to leave their house toward the end of her life.[28] These descriptions of Bundy's grandparents have been questioned in more recent investigations. Some locals remembered Samuel Cowell as a \"fine man\", if a bit eccentric. A cousin of Bundy claimed that the negative characterizations of Samuel Cowell likely arose to explain why his grandson became a serial killer. In addition, Louise's sister Audrey stated that their mother couldn't leave her home because she suffered a stroke due to being overweight and was not mentally ill.[29]\n",

        "paragraph": "Oscar Mack (September 20, 1892 \u2013 January 2, 1960) was an African-American World War I vet. An attempt was made to lynch Oscar Mack (Newspapers of the time also use the name John Mack) in Kissimmee, Osceola County, Florida. According to the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary it was the 39th of 61 lynchings during 1922 in the United States.[1] The New Britain Herald reported that he was lynched in Lake Jennie Jewell, in Orange County.[2]\nMack survived the lynching attempt and fled Florida. He married Dorothy Sanders in 1938 and had two daughters. He died in 1960.\nThe 1900 census of Osceola County, Florida shows a young Oscar Mack living with his parents, William and Marie Mack, as well as brothers William Jr. and Charles. William Mack Sr. was born in Georgia in 1864 and worked as a labourer. Oscar's mother was born in North Carolina in 1864, and worked as a laundress. They married in 1888. At the age of 25, he enlisted in the U.S. Army on April 26, 1918, fighting in France, and was stationed in Greece. He was honourably discharged on July 17, 1919, and returned to Osceola County, Florida, where he worked as a butcher.\nJust over a year before the lynching attempt of Mack was the Ocoee massacre. The Ocoee massacre was an incident of mass racial violence which saw a white mob attack numerous African American residents in the northern parts of Ocoee, Florida, a town located in Orange County near Orlando. The massacre killed dozens of African-Americans and took place on November 2, 1920.\nIn 1922, While looking for employment he bid for a federal contract to move mail from the Kissimmee railroad depot to the post office. His winning bid undercut another contractor who verbally threatened Mack.[3] When Mack told his boss, Assistant Postmaster C.C. Collins, about the threats Collins gave him a gun.[4][3]\nAfter Mack's first day of work three \"white men \u2014 likely Klansmen \u2014 came to his house\".[3] There was an altercation and Mack used the gun given to him by Collins. In the shootout, Gene Rinehart was killed, Stuart Ivey died of his wounds a few days later, and the third assailant A.C. Aldeman escaped unharmed.[5][4][6]\nWhen word of the killing of two white men by Mack spread, a huge mob gathered. The mob hunted Oscar Mack and terrorized the local Black community, and almost 200 African-American families left the area. At one point a Black man was held by the mob but it wasn't Mack. Luckily the local sheriff was able to get the mob to release the innocent man. On July 19, 1922, newspapers like the New Britain Herald reported that Oscar Mack was lynched in Lake Jennie Jewell, in Orange County.[2]\nAssistant Postmaster C.C. Collins was forced to relocate to Tampa, Florida, due to giving Oscar a gun to defend himself.\nOscar Mack actually escaped the mob via the Florida Swamps and made his way out of the State where he changed his name to Lanier Johnson. He married Dorothy Sanders in 1938 and adopted Dorothy's child Norda May Sanders. They moved from state to state worried the KKK would find them. Moving from New Jersey to Connecticut, Youngstown, Ohio, and finally settling in Akron, Ohio around 1940, where they had two daughters, Mildred Hurt and Melissa Hurt. In January of 1944, Oscar's wife Dorothea died as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was only 44 years old. There he lived until January 2, 1960.[3]\n",

A lone gunman, David Katz, shot and killed two people and injured another ten before committing suicide.[1][4]\nThe GLHF (Good Luck Have Fun) Game Bar, a video game venue in the Jacksonville Landing indoor marketplace, hosted a Madden NFL 19 video gaming tournament on August 26, 2018, with around 130 to 150 participants and onlookers.[9] After one of the participants, David Katz, lost a game, he refused to shake the hand of the winner and left the tournament. Soon after, he returned with one of the two handguns he had brought to the event.[10]\nKatz fired 12 shots,[11] killing two people and wounding ten others, then committed suicide. One more sustained injuries while fleeing.[12][13][6] A tournament announcer said that he had been interviewing the first victim before he was fatally shot, and that he had been intentionally targeted. The gunman then turned and began shooting indiscriminately.[14]\nGunfire was first reported on social media at 1:34 pm EDT by tournament participants.[15][16] The event's Twitch stream recorded footage of the shooting, which was later uploaded to YouTube.[17]\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff's Office urged individuals to stay away from the location at 2:13\u00a0p.m. EDT, and SWAT officers evacuated and searched the area.[18] First responders arrived on the scene within two minutes of the first 911 call, and arrived at 1:36 pm EDT.[19] The president of the firefighters union told reporters that they were training in the area when victims had run up to them for help.[20] Due to the location being next to the St. Johns River, the Coast Guard was called in to sweep the surrounding waterways.[13]\nEleven people were taken to hospitals for treatment of their injuries. Some of the injured had been able to leave the bar and sought assistance from first responders.[25] Two others had driven themselves to the hospital.[4] Of those injured, ten individuals received gunshot wounds and one person was injured attempting to flee from the location.[26] The day after the incident Memorial Hospital released a statement that one individual had minor injuries, and three were in good condition, and UF Health announced that four victims had been released, with two still admitted.[27]\nThe shooter, David Katz, was a 24-year-old professional Madden player from Baltimore, Maryland, who had been attending the Jacksonville tournament as a participant.[28] Katz had lost a few rounds in the competition, which prevented him from reaching the finals. Fellow competitors reported that he had been \"acting weird\" and refused to shake hands with them after losing the competition.[29] His pseudonyms included \"Bread\", \"mrslicedbread\", \"RavensChamp\", \"ravens2012champ\" and \"TREXHAVAHARTATAK\".[30][31][32] He had previously won $10,000 in a 2017 Madden Tournament. Katz had a history of mental illness and was prescribed anti-psychotic medicine.[33] He was diagnosed with dysthymia and oppositional disorder not otherwise specified and had been involuntarily  committed to mental hospitals on numerous occasions.[34]\nThe Jacksonville Sheriff's Office used Twitter to announce that there were fatalities at the scene at 2:45\u00a0p.m. EDT,[35] and that one suspect was dead at the scene at 2:53\u00a0p.m. EDT.[36] Initially, it was unknown whether there were additional gunmen,[13] but later, officials confirmed that there was only one suspect in the shooting.[37] He was armed with a .45 caliber handgun and a 9mm handgun, with the Sheriffs Office stating that one of the weapons was equipped with an aftermarket laser sight attached to the trigger guard.[10] The weapons had been stored in his vehicle, and purchased legally in Baltimore, Maryland.[16]\n",

The gunman, identified as Scott Paul Beierle, shot six women, two of them fatally, and pistol-whipped a man before killing himself.[2][3]\nCriminal investigators attested to the attacker's hatred of women. The US Secret Service and International Centre for Counter-Terrorism consider the attack an act of misogynist terrorism.[4][5]\nScott Paul Beierle entered the hot yoga studio at 5:37\u00a0p.m. EDT on November 2, 2018, shooting six people, resulting in the deaths of two women, Maura Binkley, 21, and Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 61.[2] Officers responded to reports of gunfire within three and a half minutes, at which point the perpetrator was found deceased.[6] Partygoers in a bar across the street told reporters how they witnessed people fleeing from the studio and that a man in a bloody white T-shirt who ran into the bar claimed to have charged the shooter only to be pistol whipped.[7] This claim was later backed up in interviews with survivors who stated that the male customer used a vacuum cleaner and then a broomstick to attack Beierle, which gave other students time to escape. Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo also credited the students who \"fought back and tried not only to save themselves but other people\".[8]\nThe yoga studio was a part of a plaza that is occupied by restaurants and other businesses. Those eating at the restaurant underneath the studio heard the gunshots and told reporters that the owner came through the dining area shortly after, asking if anyone was a doctor.[9]\nWhen officers arrived, it was discovered that six people had been shot during the attack. Two victims, Maura Binkley and Nancy Van Vessem, were deceased at the scene.[10] Maura Binkley, age 21, was a student at Florida State University, and due to graduate in 2019.[11] Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, age 61, was a doctor and the chief medical director for Capital Health Plan. She was also a faculty member at Florida State.[12]\nScott Paul Beierle (October 6, 1978 \u2013 November 2, 2018)[13] was later revealed as the perpetrator by police. According to his social media profiles on Facebook and LinkedIn, Beierle was a military veteran and former teacher for the Anne Arundel County Public School System in Maryland, teaching both English and social studies at Meade High School and being affiliated with conservative groups FSU College Republicans and We Are Conservatives.[14][15][16] Additionally, Beierle has also taught at numerous other schools as a substitute teacher, yet only briefly due to performance issues and inappropriate behavior. In one instance, Beierle was fired for an incident where he reportedly asked a female student if she was \"ticklish\", while touching her \"below the bra line\" on her stomach.[17] He had been charged twice for battery, in 2012 and 2016, where he was accused of grabbing a woman's buttocks in both situations.[18]\nYouTube videos posted by Beierle in 2014 showed that he identified with the involuntary celibate community while often complaining about  his sexual rejections from women.[19] He also sympathized with the shooter behind the 2014 Isla Vista killings, Elliot Rodger, as he too felt lonely and unloved as well as posting misogynistic songs on SoundCloud. Other videos depicted him ranting about African-Americans, illegal immigration and interracial relationships.[20][21][22] One of the videos was named \"Dangers of Diversity\".[23]\nThe FBI and the Tallahassee Police Department attested to Beierle's hatred of women, saying he was \"disturbed\" during the shooting.  They further noted he had planned the attack months in advance.[24] The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism lists the attack as an act of misogynist terrorism.[5]\n",

On August 11, 1985, Robinson and 16-year-old Clinton Fields were travelling from along I-95 in Florida when they came upon St. George's car, which had broken down along the highway.\nRobinson took St. George to a nearby cemetery where Robinson claimed that the two had consensual sex on the hood of a car. Prosecutors contended that she was sexually assaulted. St. George was shot twice, but Robinson claimed that the gun \"accidentally\" fired, hitting her in the face, and that he then shot her again to make sure she was dead, claiming \"How do you tell someone I accidentally shot a white woman?\" Clinton Fields, Robinson's co-defendant, testified at trial that Robinson abducted St. George at gunpoint and had planned to kill her.\nRobinson and Fields were arrested several days later following another rape and robbery. Based largely upon Fields' testimony, Robinson was convicted and sentenced to death in June 1986; Fields was sentenced to life in prison. On appeal, Robinson's death sentence was overturned by the Florida Supreme Court; his attorneys contended that questions and statements made by prosecutors amounted to racial bias against Robinson. A second sentencing hearing in 1989 restored the death sentence.\nDuring further appeals, Robinson's defense lawyers continued to contend that Robinson was the victim of racial discrimination, that he was abused as a child, and that Fields, with an IQ of 50, was coerced by prosecutors into giving false testimony. (Fields did recant his trial testimony in January 2004.) Final appeals to the United States Supreme Court challenged the process of lethal injection as cruel and unusual punishment.\nRobinson was scheduled to be executed at 6:00\u00a0p.m. on February 4, 2004, but less than 15 minutes before the scheduled time, the United States Supreme Court contacted the Florida governor's office, asking the state to briefly halt the execution; the court returned their decision about an hour later, refusing, on a vote of 5\u20134, to halt the execution.\nRobinson's final meal prior to his execution was fried chicken gizzards, french fries, smoked sausage, and butter pecan ice cream. His final words before being executed by lethal injection were: \"Yep... Later!\" Robinson was pronounced dead at Florida State Prison in Raiford at 7:34\u00a0p.m. on February 4, 2004. His execution was the 895th carried out in the United States since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, and the 58th in Florida.\n",

He was arrested at the young age of 19 on July 24, 1987, making him one of the youngest serial killers in American history. He was sentenced to death in 1991, but was re-tried and sentenced to death again in 1994.\nWalls' roommate went to the police and implicated him in the murders, and after a search of Walls' apartment, items were found that were stolen from the crime scene. He was arrested on July 24.[3] After his arrest, Walls was implicated in the unsolved murders of Cynthia Sue Condra, (Age 19) and Tommie Lou Whiddon, (Age 19) who were murdered on March 26, 1985, when Walls was only 17.[2] He was also linked by circumstantial evidence to the murder of Audrey Gygi, (Age 47) who was murdered on May 2, 1987.[citation needed] Walls was convicted of the murders and was sentenced to death in 1991.[citation needed] However, a new trial occurred in 1994, and Walls was re-sentenced to death.[citation needed]\n",

Skipper's body was discovered on March 15 along a roadside in Wahneta, Florida. Two men were arrested in connection with the crime: William David Brown Jr., and Joseph Bearden, 20 and 21 years old at the time of the incident, respectively. The men were charged with first-degree murder and robbery.[1]\nBearden was convicted of second degree murder in addition to four additional counts on February 27, 2009.[2] He was sentenced to life in prison for the murder charge, two 15-year terms and two five-year terms, all to be served concurrently, on the remaining four charges. On April 16, 2015, however, the Florida Supreme Court quashed the District Court's opinion and granted Bearden a new trial based on incorrect evidentiary rulings regarding a potential third-party confession.\nBrown claimed he killed Skipper in retaliation for unwanted sexual advances.[3] He was found guilty by a Polk County jury and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\nAt 9 p.m. on March 14, after finishing work in Winter Haven, Skipper met friend Karl von Hahmann for dinner. They left the restaurant at 10:30 pm. Skipper returned home where Von Hahmann spoke to him on the telephone at 11:10 pm, after which roommate Kelly Evans saw him go into his bedroom.[3]\nSome time around midnight, according to the Polk County, Florida Sheriff's Office, Skipper met Bearden, a convicted car thief who also pleaded no contest to a battery charge in 2004.[3] Sometime afterwards, Skipper, Brown and Bearden drove away in Skipper's car; 15 minutes later Brown and Bearden returned alone.\nIt is not fully known how Skipper met Bearden and Brown, but Skipper's roommate Joyce Fraley claims to have seen Brown at their house on several occasions.[3] Friend Stephanie Strickland also says that Brown knew a previous tenant of Skipper's home, and lived two blocks away. Allegedly, Brown had visited the home a few times just weeks before he and Bearden murdered Skipper.[1]\nSkipper was beaten, stabbed 20 times and his throat slit. His body was dumped by the side of a road in Wahneta, a small town outside Winter Haven. His car was abandoned at Lake Pansy, and the fingerprints of both accused were found inside.[1]\nThe first trial in the case, that of Joseph Eli Bearden, began February 16, 2009.[4]\nOn February 28, 2009, after nearly two days of deliberation, jurors found Joseph Bearden guilty of second-degree murder in Ryan Skipper's death. Prosecutors had charged him with first-degree murder and sought the death penalty. Bearden was also found guilty on four other counts: theft of a motor vehicle, accessory after the fact, tampering with evidence, and dealing in stolen property. Bearden was sentenced to life behind bars for the second-degree murder charge, as well as two five-year and two fifteen-year sentences for the other charges, to run concurrently with the life sentence. Bearden appealed the conviction and the Second District Court of Appeal affirmed. On April 16, 2015, however, the Florida Supreme Court quashed the District Court's opinion and granted Bearden a new trial, stating that \"the trial court improperly evaluated the credibility of Tyler's testimony, erroneously determined that Bearden's statement was not adequate corroboration under Chambers, and improperly prevented Bearden from recalling Ray Allen Brown.\" Ray Allen Brown was the individual who Bearden claimed was in the car at the time of the murder as opposed to himself. On the second day of trial, a witness had come forward claiming that Ray Allen confessed to being in the car, a statement which could have potentially exonerated Bearden if the jury was permitted to hear her account of the confession and decide for itself whether it was believable. In doing so, the court prevented Bearden from presenting his entire defense to the jury and thus, Bearden was deprived of his constitutional rights. Hence, the Florida Supreme Court granted Bearden a new trial in accordance with its opinion. In October of 2016, Bearden pled guilty to third-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

McDonough which gave Hill a temporary reprieve. The Court concluded that Mr. Hill did have the right to make an Eighth Amendment claim against Florida's method of lethal injection, overturning a District Court ruling. The ruling did not declare that the chemical used in lethal injections in Florida was unconstitutional, but it allows inmates to make the claim.[1]\nHowever, a district court in Tallahassee and an appeals court in Atlanta refused to hear Hill's challenges, ruling that he should have filed earlier. An appeal was again filed with the Supreme Court, which voted 5-4 on September 20, 2006 to deny another stay.\nLater that day, 24 years after his crime, Hill was executed through lethal injection by the state of Florida, at the Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida. He did not reply when asked if he had a last statement, staring straight at the ceiling, awaiting start of the lethal injection.[2]\n",

As the FBI handler for Bulger and Flemmi, Connolly (who had grown up in the Old Harbor Housing Project with Bulger) had been protecting them from prosecution by supplying Bulger with information about possible attempts to catch them. Connolly was indicted on December 22, 1999, on charges of alerting Bulger and Flemmi to investigations, falsifying FBI reports to cover their crimes, and accepting bribes.[3]\nIn 2000, Connolly was charged with additional racketeering-related offenses. He was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to ten years in federal prison.[4] In 2008, Connolly was convicted on state charges of second-degree murder in Florida and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was released from federal prison on June 28, 2011,[5] and transferred to the Florida State Prison to serve the remainder of his sentence for his 2008 conviction.[6]\nIn April 2020, Connolly asked to be allowed to serve the remainder of his sentence on home confinement due to fears of contracting COVID-19, citing a 2018 federal law allowing for compassionate release under \"extraordinary\" circumstances, such as age, health and other critical factors.[7] A Miami-Dade judge initially declined to order his release,[8] but Connolly was later granted a medical release on February 17, 2021.[9]\nJohn Joseph Connolly Jr. is the namesake and son of an Irish immigrant, John Connolly Sr. of Maigh Cuilinn in County Galway,[10] a Gillette employee for 50 years. Connolly's mother, Bridget T. Connolly (n\u00e9e Kelly), was a housewife. They lived in the Old Harbor Housing Project in Boston, the first public housing project in New England, on O'Callaghan Way until John Jr. was 12 years old. The Bulger family, residing a few doors down, had lived there since its New Deal creation in 1938; other residents were future US Representative Joseph Moakley,[11] and Francis \"Buddy\" Leonard, who would later be allegedly murdered by Bulger in 1975 during his battle for power over the rackets.[12]\nConnolly admired the studious William Bulger, six years his senior; he did not meet his older brother, Jimmy, nicknamed \"Whitey\" because of his white-blond hair, until he was eight years old. The 19-year-old Bulger, who was already notorious as the leader of the Mercer Street gang, bought the other neighborhood boys ice cream cones and convinced an awestruck Connolly to accept the treat. Later that same year, Connolly found himself outnumbered in a skirmish over a ball with some older boys. According to Connolly, Bulger came along and chased the bullies away.[13]\nIn 1952, Connolly's family moved to the City Point neighborhood of South Boston. John Jr. was able to attend Columbus High School, a Catholic high school in the Italian North End neighborhood. His younger brother, James, who later sought a career in law enforcement, joined the DEA New England Division based in Boston.[14]\nConnolly was encouraged to attend Boston College by Billy Bulger, and after graduation, took classes at Suffolk University Law School.[1] He later earned a graduate degree in Public Administration from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government.[15][16]\n",

The anthology is curated by writers Renee Bess and Lee Lynch and contains contributions from LGBT writers from all walks of life. The anthology was created to give LGBTQ writers a chance to reflect upon the role of the gay bar in their lives and to express its importance to non-LGBTQ people.[1]\nThe massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida brought LGBT club life into the public view. However, it became apparent that many people outside of the LGBTQ community did not truly understand the role that bars and clubs play in the community and how their importance evolved over the years.[2]\nWhen writer Renee Bess read Lee Lynch's blog, \"Freedom Clothes\", she noticed the historical descriptions of gay bar life mirrored the contemporary descriptions of the gay bar's role in the lives of LGBTQ persons. Despite the commonly accepted belief that the gay bar is a place of refuge and self-affirmation, it is also a place that offers different experiences to different members of the LGBTQ community. Bess felt it was important to have a discussion about the significance of the gay bar/club in LGBTQ culture. The idea of inviting writers to contribute their pieces of short fiction, slices of their bar-related memoirs, and their poetry to an anthology came to mind as a means of sharing the LGBTQ club experience with the world.[2][3]\nBess asked Lynch, a revered member of the lesbian writers' community, if she would like to join her in inviting LGBTQ writers to create and submit original poetry, fiction, nonfiction, essay, and memoir pieces that explore the role the gay bar's culture has played in their life or the lives of the LGBT community.[4]\nThe \"gay bar anthology\" was titled Our Happy Hours: LGBT Voices From the Gay Bars and was published in the fall of 2017 by Flashpoint Publications.[5][6] It also contains memoir pieces about gay life in the 1960s before the acceptance of the LGBT community within the mainstream society.[6]\nThe anthology contains stories and poetry from over thirty LGBT writers that were influenced or inspired by LGBT bar experience and covers themes ranging from \"fiery political birthplaces\", \"poetic reverence\", and \"points of resistance.[7][8]\nThe necessity of the anthology came as a result of the massacre and the fact the many LGBT youth are homeless. The curators felt the royalties from the book should go to help homeless youth. It was decided the royalties from the anthology will go to benefit the Attic Youth Center in Philadelphia and Ali Forney Center in New York City.[9]\n",

        "paragraph": "Andre Maurice Waters (March 10, 1962 \u2013 November 20, 2006) was an American football safety who played for the Philadelphia Eagles and Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) from 1984 to 1995.  Waters was regarded as one of the NFL's dirtiest players, serving as an integral part of one of the league's top defenses.  On November 20, 2006, Waters committed suicide and was subsequently diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\nWaters was born in Belle Glade, Florida and grew up in extreme poverty in rural Florida, and attended Pahokee High School. Waters received some attention in high school but ended up attending Cheyney University[1] At Cheyney University of Pennsylvania Waters was recognized as All-PSAC three straight years.[2]\nIn 1984, Waters was signed as an undrafted free agent by Philadelphia Eagles head coach Marion Campbell. He returned a kickoff for an 89-yard game-winning touchdown against the Washington Redskins as a rookie in 1984. When Buddy Ryan took over for Campbell in 1986, he welcomed Waters' aggressive style as a fierce tackler and ferocious hitter, earning Waters a position in the starting lineup for the next eight years.  He blossomed under defensive coordinator Bud Carson. His tackle of Los Angeles Rams quarterback Jim Everett in 1988 led to a rule prohibiting defensive players from hitting quarterbacks below the waist while they are still in the pocket; for a while, it was unofficially termed the \"Andre Waters Rule\".  NFL broadcaster Dan Dierdorf notoriously nicknamed the Eagles defender \"Dirty Waters\". He scored a touchdown in 1989 when he took a lateral from William Frizzell after Reggie White caused a fumble by New York Giants quarterback Phil Simms.\nWaters served as part of the Eagles' defensive unit that was regarded as one of the league's all-time best, in 1991 ranking first statistically in both run and pass defense, as well as total defense.  His hard-hitting style translated into leading the team in tackles for four seasons and endeared him with Philadelphia fans but often led to penalties and fines for some of his tackles. He led the Eagles in tackles in 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1991. He recorded 15 interceptions in 156 games. In 1994, he was replaced by Mike Zordich due to his contract ending.\nAfter retiring as a player, Waters worked as a college football coach. In 1996, he joined the staff of Stump Mitchell at Morgan State as defensive backs coach.[3] The following year under head coach Jim Leavitt, Waters took the same position on the upstart South Florida football program.[4] He remained in that position until 1999.[5] In 2000, Waters left South Florida to join the St. Louis Rams of the NFL as a coaching intern for training camp. Leavitt made Waters choose between South Florida and the internship out of concern that Waters would miss too much preparation time with South Florida.[5]\nAfter his Rams internship, Waters returned to Tampa to be defensive coordinator at Paul R. Wharton High School in 2000. In 2001, Waters moved back to the college level as defensive backs coach at Alabama State.[6][7] In 2002, Waters joined the Detroit Lions in his second stint as an NFL coaching intern.[8]  He later coached at St. Augustine's from 2002 to 2005 as defensive coordinator upon the football program's return from a 35-year hiatus.[6][9][10] In 2006, Waters was defensive coordinator at Fort Valley State.[11] Waters described his disappointment in not getting a full-time NFL coaching job to The Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Phil Sheridan.[5][12]  He remained very close to his former Eagles coach Buddy Ryan, whom Waters said he tried to emulate in his own coaching career.\nWaters died by suicide shortly after 1 a.m. on November 20, 2006, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, dying of a gunshot to the head.  He was at his home in Tampa, Florida where he was discovered by his girlfriend.[10] He was buried at Foreverglades Cemetery in Belle Glade, Florida.\nShortly after Waters' death, former Harvard defensive tackle and WWE wrestler Dr. Christopher Nowinski, whose wrestling career was ended by post-concussion syndrome and has since written a book about the dangers of concussions in contact sports, approached Waters' family and asked permission to have his brain tissue examined.  After receiving permission, Nowinski had samples of Waters' brain tissue sent to neuropathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu at the University of Pittsburgh. Omalu believed, having examined the tissue, that Waters sustained brain damage from playing football: he went on to state that this led to Waters' depression.[13] Omalu determined that Waters' brain tissue had developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and degenerated into that of an 80-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease, caused or hastened by the numerous concussions Waters sustained playing football.[14]\nWaters was portrayed by actor Richard T. Jones in the 2015 film Concussion.\n",

It is also the subject of a Dateline NBC special, When A Killer Calls,[2] as well as being mentioned in Lords of Chaos: The Bloody Rise of the Satanic Metal Underground by Michael Moynihan & Didrik S\u00f8derlind, the book even borrowing the group's name.\nOn April 12, 1996, in Fort Myers, Florida, Kevin Foster, Pete Magnotti, and Chris Black went on a vandalism and arson spree.[2] Florida juvenile records show that only the group's ringleader, Kevin Foster, had any prior arrests or criminal history, and his record primarily consisted of driving violations. The first spree was quickly followed by a second that included an attempt to burn a church bus and the burning of a bird cage containing two macaws, killing one.\nAfter the night of destruction, Foster decided they should form a militia dedicated to terrorizing the community. The creation of the group's symbol ( (\u00d8) ) came from an in-joke involving a question Foster missed on a math test. The symbol for the null or empty set is either { } or \u00d8. On the test, Foster wrote ( \u00d8 ) as the answer to a question whose answer was not set, marking it incorrect.\nKevin \"God\" Foster, Pete \"Fried\" Magnotti, Chris \"Slim\" Black, and Derek \"Mob\" Shields made up the core members of the Lords of Chaos. The group also included lesser associates, Chris \"Red\" Burnett, Thomas \"Dog\" Torrone, Brad Young, and Craig Lesh.\nIn an East Lee Tribune article titled \"Hell Raising in Buckingham,\" a local reporter lashed out at the unknown culprits, calling them \"obviously pea-brained vandals\" and \"person(s) of less than average intelligence and a cretin's personality.\"[3]:\u200a102\u200a This article only further antagonized the boys.\nOn April 17, the group wrote a document entitled \"Declaration of War \u2014 Formal Introduction of Lords of Chaos,\" which they planned to mail to the Lee County Clerk/Traffic Violations Bureau but ultimately did not. The manifesto warned:\nLee County is dealing with a formidable foe, with high caliber intelligence, balls of titanium alloy, and a wicked, destructive streak. . . Be prepared for destruction of biblical proportions, for this is the coming of a NEW GOD, whose fiery hand shall lay waste to the populous [sic].\nTHE GAMES HAVE JUST BEGUN, AND TERROR SHALL ENSUE. . . .[3]:\u200a112\u200a",

He played with the Crescent City Jazzers and the Arcadian Serenaders, and with Jean Goldkette's Orchestra in 1927 until 1928,[1] after the departure of Beiderbecke. Following this he worked in the house band at radio station WGN in Chicago before joining Ben Pollack from 1930 to 1933.[1] He also worked with Eddie Sheasby in Chicago, and moved to New York City in 1933. He had many gigs in New York in the 1930s and 1940s, including time with Joe Haymes (1934\u201335) and Tommy Dorsey (1935), Ray Noble (1936), Benny Goodman (1936), Lana Webster, Glenn Miller (1937), Bob Crosby (1937\u201339), Bobby Hackett (1939), Bob Zurke, Jack Teagarden, Bud Freeman (1942), George Brunies, Bobby Sherwood (1943), Miff Mole, Art Hodes, Horace Heidt (1944), and Tiny Hill (1946).[1] Following this he did some further freelancing in Chicago and New York, and then moved to Florida in 1948, setting up his own bands there.\nBose suffered from an extended period of illness in the 1950s, and eventually committed suicide in July 1958 in St. Petersburg, Florida.[2][4]\n",

He was supposed to fly with his wife, Anne Buechner, to Orlando, Florida, returning from a missionary trip to Quito, Ecuador.\nThe shooting took place on a jetway. Alpizar ran away from the aircraft and, Homeland Security officials maintain, claimed to have a bomb in his bag and then made a sudden movement toward it.\nOn December 7, 2005, upon landing at Miami International Airport, from Medell\u00edn, Colombia, the airplane on which Alpizar was traveling taxied to the gate and passengers began disembarking to be processed by Customs Agents. At about 14:00 (2:00 PM) EST, passengers continuing on to Orlando were re-boarding the plane.\nAs the plane finished boarding and all 114 passengers were seated,[1] Alpizar was heard having an argument with his wife, Anne Buechner.[2] He stood up from his seat saying, \"I have to get off the plane\",[2] and ran for the door, which was still open. Buechner chased after him, yelling, \"He's sick\". He was followed by an undercover air marshal. According to James E. Bauer, two Air Marshals confronted Alpizar near the cockpit when Alpizar \"uttered threatening words that included a sentence to the effect that he had a bomb\". Homeland Security spokesperson Brian Doyle later claimed that Alpizar \"threatened that he had a bomb in his backpack\" and \"made a move toward the backpack\".[3] Ignoring requests to stop, Alpizar continued to exit the plane and was soon confronted just outside the aircraft in the jetway. After being ordered to the ground, Alpizar allegedly did not comply, instead reaching for the bag. The two Air Marshals pulled out their .357 SIG Sauer pistols and opened fire, killing Alpizar. Conflicting reports put the number of shots between three and nine.[citation needed]\nJust hours later, in a nationally broadcast interview with All Things Considered's Michele Norris, Eric Weiner of NPR[4] reported the assertion of Homeland Security Special Agent in Charge James Bauer that Alpizar claimed to have a bomb in his carry-on bag. Recapping the events that led to Alpizar's shooting, Weiner reported, \"They were reboarding the flight, it was continuing to Orlando. That's when Federal Air Marshals confronted this man. He was acting suspiciously, he claimed to have a bomb, Federal Air Marshals told him to get on the ground. He did not comply.\" Several passengers on the flight denied the government's claim, saying they never heard Alpizar say anything about a bomb. One of the passengers, John McAlhany, said in an interview, \"I never heard the word 'bomb' on the plane\", ... \"I never heard the word 'bomb' until the FBI asked me did you hear the word 'bomb'.\"[2] and another passenger, Mary Gardner, added, \"I did not hear him say that he had a bomb\".[5] A spokesman for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants has been[6] quoted as saying that a flight attendant who confronted Alpizar as he tried to leave the plane claimed Alpizar said \"I have a bomb\", though this assertion has not been repeated, and this flight attendant has not come forward. According to the Miami Dade State Attorney's Office Final Report of May 23, 2006, the pilot claimed to have heard Alpizar say he had a bomb.\nAfter the shooting, police dogs sniffed all luggage for explosives and passengers were held on the plane until all luggage was cleared. No bombs or explosives were found.[2][7] McAlhany said he remembers having a shotgun pressed into his head by one officer and hearing cries and screams from many passengers aboard the aircraft after the shooting in the jetway. \"This was wrong\", McAlhany said, \"This man should be with his family for Christmas. Now he\u2019s dead\".[5]\nThe D Concourse of Miami International Airport was temporarily evacuated following the shooting and was re-opened around 15:00 (3:00 PM) EST.\nFrom Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Homeland Security reports, this incident was the first time a U.S. Federal Air Marshal has fired a weapon in the line of duty. Six days after Alpizar was shot, the U.S. government gave the organization expanded powers to \"identify suspicious passengers\". The Air Marshals were \"eager to conduct surveillance activities beyond the aircraft, and tighten security at public transit stations over the holiday\".[8]\n",

        "paragraph": "John Price Hayter Jr. (September 28, 1933 \u2013 February 21, 1995) was an American serial killer. A lifelong criminal, he was convicted of killing a fellow prisoner and two women on three separate occasions from 1953 to 1986 in Texas and Florida. Sentenced to multiple life terms, he died while behind bars for his Florida convictions.\nOn November 29, 1952, the 19-year-old Hayter stole a 1951 Packard 200 from a man named O. F. Jones in Austin, Texas, which he then drove to a parking lot in his native Waco. He was swiftly arrested for this crime, and when brought to trial, he pleaded guilty to automobile theft and was sentenced to two years imprisonment.[1]\nHe was then transported to the Ramsey Unit in Brazoria County, where he was supposed to serve out his sentence.[2] On August 18, 1953, more than seven months after his arrival, Hayter was bailing hay with 18-year-old fellow convict Leroy Oscar Martin when the pair supposedly got into an argument with one another. In the process, Hayter stabbed Martin with his pitchfork, killing him on the spot. Little information was released about the killing and the motive behind it, but Hayter was convicted and sentenced to a life term with the possibility of parole.[2]\nHayter served 21 years of his life sentence when he was granted parole by the Board of Pardons and Paroles in Austin. He returned to Waco and found work at a machine shop, but exactly two weeks later, he attempted a hold-up of a Robertson's Hams store in Abbott. Hayter then kidnapped the cashier, 17-year-old Linda Ruth Pibil, drove to a rural area, and raped her before shooting her to death. Pibil's body was later found abandoned near Fort Hood by two soldiers.[3]\nApproximately a month later, Hayter, pretending to be an electrician, went to the house of a woman in Lacy Lakeview and asked to check out a supposed power failure. While pretending to examine the TV and other electrical equipment, he pulled out a switchblade on the woman's baby, threatening to cut its throat if she did not do what he said.[3] He then instructed the woman to get into her car with him, and then drive around several residential areas until he could find a good spot. However, the victim's grandmother realized what was going on and notified the authorities, who managed to track down the car and give chase. During the chase, the victim managed to jump out of the car, leaving it to crash into one of the police officers' cars. Hayter, who was still inside, survived the crash and was immediately arrested.[3] Not long after, he was charged with the abduction of the Lacy Lakeview victim and the murder of Pibil, as he had been identified as the girl's abductor by several witnesses. For both of these crimes, he was convicted and again sentenced to life imprisonment.[3]\nCirca June 1986, Hayter was paroled yet again, but this time did not stay in Texas and started drifting around the country, supplying his income via thefts and burglaries. On September 15, he broke into an apartment in Lakeland, Florida, tying up, sexually assaulting, and then strangling 80-year-old Teena Ambrose, who lived there by herself, using a rain bonnet's plastic tie.[4] He then stole her 1966 Plymouth Fury and fled the area, driving to Delray Beach before abandoning the vehicle. From there, he went to the home of an elderly couple, threatened them at gunpoint, and bound them before stealing their 1986 Mercury Marquis.[5] With this car, Hayter drove towards Grants, New Mexico, where he was arrested by local authorities for the auto theft. During an interview with a local detective, he voluntarily confessed to the Florida crimes, and was positively identified as a suspect by a distinctive tattoo on his forearm depicting an outline of his home state with the words 'Texas' inside'.[5]\nHayter's trial was scheduled to take place at Courtroom 1 in Bartow, which at the time was considered a historic courtroom noted for its emotionally charged trials and poor acoustics.[6] Coincidentally, it was also scheduled to be the last murder trial to be set there before its planned renovation by the Polk County Commission.[7]\nWhen the trial began, prosecutors procured a tape containing a conversation between Hayter and Polk County Det. Larry Ashley. In it, Hayter explained that he was driving along the I-4 when he noticed Ambrose's house, opting to rob it because there was nobody inside. After stealing some jewelry from her bedroom, he began searching for more valuables in the living room when he saw Ambrose parking in her driveway.[8] When she entered, he claimed that he accosted her and moved to the bedroom, where he planned to tie her up and steal her personal items, but she resisted fiercely and he resorted to slapping her. Hayter claimed that he left her behind without killing Ambrose, assuming that she had choked to death on the gags, before fleeing the area altogether.[9]\nThose claims were disputed by Dr. James Holimon, a forensic medical examiner who concluded that the restraints placed on Ambrose were so tight that they broke her larynx, rendering her unable to breathe. This, coupled with the fact that plastic ligatures and a gag had been placed in her mouth, indicated that they were done in a deliberate and premeditated manner with the intention of killing the victim.[10] Prosecutors also indicated that, if the need ever arose, they would bring forward witness testimony from the elderly couple from Delray Beach, who were certain they could identify their assailant if they saw his distinctive tattoo.[11]\n",

The crime scene was described as \"very complicated\" by the FBI special agent in charge.[1] The president of Miami-Dade's police union claimed that at least eleven officers opened fire on the UPS truck in response to the robbers' firing first.[2]\nAt approximately 4:14 p.m., Lamar Alexander and Ronnie Jerome Hill robbed the jewelry store, Regent Jeweler at Miracle Mile in Coral Gables, Florida.[3] They held the store's cashier at gunpoint and stole diamonds. The two suspects exchanged gunfire with the store owner during the robbery,[4] injuring one jewelry shop worker and hitting nearby Coral Gables City Hall with a stray bullet, causing that building to be placed on lock down.[5][6]\nPolice were alerted when the store's silent alarm system went off. Ninety seconds later, when officers arrived, the gunmen opened fire on the officers, who then returned fire on the gunmen. The gunmen left in a U-Haul van, which they later ditched in a suburban neighborhood one mile away.[7] The suspects then carjacked a UPS delivery truck at gunpoint and took the driver hostage. The two continued their escape in the UPS truck, heading on Interstate 75 into Broward County.[5]\nSeveral police cars pursued the suspects until the UPS truck became boxed in by slow-moving rush hour traffic in Miramar, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) north of the jewelry store.[8] Police then took cover behind the cars containing bystanders and later claimed the suspects opened fire first[8] however, the lawyer representing the two innocent victims of the shooting cites witness testimony that the police shot first.[9] A total of nineteen officers fired at the suspects, including thirteen members of the Miami-Dade Police Department. The other six officers were from the Miramar Police Department and the Pembroke Pines Police Department.[10] The pursuit and shootout were broadcast live on television by news helicopters.[8]\nFour people were killed in the shootout. Both robbery suspects,  Lamar Alexander, and Ronnie Jerome Hill, both 41, were killed by police. The hijacked UPS driver, Frank Ordonez, 27, and bystander Richard Cutshaw, 70, were also both killed in the shootout;[6] the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has not released the result of ballistics investigations that would indicate whether Ordonez and Cutshaw were shot by police or robbers.[11][12] A female store employee was shot and wounded in the initial robbery.[7][13]\nThe sister of Ordonez, who had been taken hostage, expressed her anger that the police responded quickly with gunfire, and did not attempt to negotiate the hostage situation, which she believed caused her brother's death.[13]\nAt a vigil the following year, Ordonez's brother said \"The police murdered my brother on live TV and we all had to watch in horror.\"[14] Lawsuits were later filed on behalf of Ordonez and Cutshaw, alleging that the police agencies involved had behaved negligently.[15] The litigation stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[15] Florida Department of Law Enforcement finished their investigation on Sept 17, 2021, and turned it over to  the Broward state attorney\u2019s office.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "\n\nThis is a list of mass shootings in the United States that have occurred in 2021. Mass shootings are incidents involving several victims of firearm-related violence. The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.[2][3]\nGun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group, run by Tracy Holtan, that tracks shootings and their characteristics in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the perpetrator(s), are shot in one location at roughly the same time.[4] The Congressional Research Service narrows that definition, limiting it to \"public mass shootings\", defined by four or more victims killed, excluding any victims who survive.[5][6] The Washington Post and Mother Jones use similar definitions, with the latter acknowledging that their definition \"is a conservative measure of the problem\", as many shootings with fewer fatalities occur.[7][8] The crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker project has the most expansive definition of four or more shot in any incident, including the perpetrator in the victim inclusion criteria.[9][10] A 2019 study of mass shootings published in the journal Injury Epidemiology recommended developing \"a standard definition that considers both fatalities and nonfatalities to most appropriately convey the burden of mass shootings on gun violence.\"[11] The authors of the study further suggested that \"the definition of mass shooting should be four or more people, excluding the shooter, who are shot in a single event regardless of the motive, setting or number of deaths.\"[12]\nAs of December 2021, 693 (of which 303 resulted in zero deaths) fit the Mass Shooting Tracker project criterion, leaving 703 people dead and 2,842 injured, for a total of 3,545 total victims, some including the shooter(s).\nOnly incidents considered mass shootings by at least two of the above sources are listed below. Consequently, any shooting incident that satisfies the ABC News/FBI or Gun Violence Archive/Vox definitions will always be accepted, as anything that fits their definitions will be accepted under the Mass Shooting Tracker's definition. Similarly, any shooting incident that satisfies the Congressional Research Service definition will always be accepted, as anything that fits its definition will be accepted under the Mother Jones definition.\nParenthetical number indicates the number of mass shootings that occurred in that city year to date.\n\nThe statistics columns for each month are updated after the month ends, in an effort to make sure the correct number of events, individuals affected, and descriptions are accurate.

She was the first person to commit suicide on a live television broadcast.[1][2][3][4]\nChristine Chubbuck was born in Hudson, Ohio, the daughter of Margaretha D. \"Peg\" (1921\u20131994) and George Fairbanks Chubbuck (1918\u20132015). She had two brothers, Greg and Tim.[5] Chubbuck attended the Laurel School for Girls in Shaker Heights, a suburb of Cleveland. During her years at Laurel, she jokingly formed a \"Dateless Wonder Club\" with other rejected girls who did not have dates on Saturday nights.[6] Chubbuck attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, for one year, majoring in theater arts, then attended Endicott College in Beverly, Massachusetts, before earning a degree in broadcasting at Boston University in 1965.[7]\nChubbuck worked for WVIZ in Cleveland between 1966 and 1967, and attended a summer workshop in radio and television at New York University in 1967. That same year, she worked in Canton, Ohio, and, for three months, at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as an assistant producer for two local shows, Women's World and Keys to the City.[8] In 1968, Chubbuck left WQED to spend four years as a hospital computer operator and two years with a cable television firm in Sarasota, Florida. Immediately before joining ABC affiliate WXLT-TV (now WWSB), she worked in the traffic department of WTOG in St. Petersburg.[9][10]\nSeveral years before her death, Chubbuck had moved into her family's summer cottage on Siesta Key. Sally Quinn of The Washington Post later reported that she had painted the bedroom and canopied bed to look like that of a young teenager. After Chubbuck's parents were divorced, her mother Peg and younger brother Greg came to live in the Florida home. When Greg left, her elder brother Tim moved in. Chubbuck had a close relationship with her family, describing her mother and Greg as her closest friends.[11]\nWXLT's owner, Bob Nelson, hired Chubbuck as a reporter, but later gave her a community affairs talk show, Suncoast Digest, which ran at 9:00\u00a0am. Production Manager Gordon J. Acker described Chubbuck's new show to a local paper: \"It will feature local people and local activities. It will give attention, for instance, to the storefront organizations that are concerned with alcoholics, drug users, and other 'lost' segments of the community.\" Page five of the article showed a smiling Chubbuck posed with a WXLT camera.[12]\nChubbuck took her position seriously, inviting local officials from Sarasota and Bradenton to discuss matters of interest to the growing beach community. After her death, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported that she had been nominated for a Forestry and Conservation Recognition Award by the Bradenton district office of the Florida Division of Forestry. Chubbuck was considered a \"strong contender\" by district forester Mike Keel. He had been scheduled to appear as a guest on Chubbuck's show the morning of her suicide, but cancelled because of the birth of his son.[13] On occasion, Chubbuck incorporated homemade puppets she had used to entertain children with intellectual disabilities during her volunteer work at Sarasota Memorial Hospital.[11]\nChubbuck spoke to her family at length about her struggles with depression and suicidal tendencies, though she did not inform them of her intent to commit suicide on live television. She had attempted to overdose on drugs in 1970 and frequently made reference to that event. Chubbuck had been seeing a psychiatrist up until several weeks before her death. Her mother chose not to tell WXLT management about her daughter's suicidal tendencies because she feared Chubbuck would be fired.[14]\nChubbuck's focus on her lack of intimate relationships is generally considered to be the driving force for her depression. Her mother later summarized that \"her suicide was simply because her personal life was not enough.\" She lamented to co-workers that her 30th birthday was approaching, and she was still a virgin who had never been on more than two dates with a man. Her brother Greg later recalled she had gone out with a man several times before moving to Sarasota, but agreed that she had trouble connecting socially in the beach resort town. He believed her constant self-deprecation for being \"dateless\" contributed to her ongoing depression.[15]\n",

The murders went unsolved for nearly four years, until the husband of his ex-wife called a tip line and implicated him. He maintained his innocence to the end.[2]\nBolin was born on January 22, 1962, in Portland, Indiana.[3] His family consisted of laborers and carnival workers who were spread across multiple states including: Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. His father used to beat him when he was a child and his mother once walked him to a school bus stop on a leash.[4]\nBolin frequently got into trouble with the law during his youth. In 1977, he committed theft in Ohio at the age of 15 and was arrested.

He was arrested for false imprisonment, but the charge was dropped.[4]\nIn 1983, the two were married in Hillsborough County, Florida.[4]\nOn January 25, 1986, 25-year-old Natalie Blanche Holley, a night manager at a Church's Fried Chicken restaurant in Tampa, finished work and locked up the store for the night with a colleague. She left the store around 1:30\u00a0a.m. and headed to her car. Her body was found hours later by a morning jogger. She had been stabbed to death.[5]\nOn November 5, 1986, 17-year-old Stephanie Collins, a Chamberlain High School student, disappeared after finishing her shift at a drug store. On December 5, 1986, her body was found wrapped in sheets and towels. She had been stabbed to death and her skull was also crushed.[6]\nThe same day Collins' body was found, 26-year-old Teri Lynn Matthews went missing. Her car was found outside a post office with the engine still running. Her body was located later that day in some woods, wrapped in a white sheet. Her throat had been cut and she had been bludgeoned.[6]\nIn 1987, Bolin and two other men kidnapped and raped a 20-year-old waitress in Toledo, Ohio. Afterward, Bolin attempted to kill her with a gun, but the gun jammed. He let the woman go along a highway in Pennsylvania. Bolin was captured and was sentenced to 22 to 75 years in prison.[7]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nGerald Eugene Stano (born Paul Zeininger; September 12, 1951 \u2013 March 23, 1998) was an American convicted serial killer. Stano murdered at least 22 young women and girls, though police say the number may be closer to 80. \nStano was born as Paul Zeininger on September 12, 1951 in Schenectady, New York, the fifth child born to his mother, and the third she put up for adoption.[1][2] His biological mother neglected him to such an extent that when she gave him up for adoption at six months old, county doctors declared that he could not be adopted. They said Zeininger was functioning at \"an animalistic level\", even eating his own faeces to survive. Zeininger had four biological siblings who were given up for adoption. A nurse named Norma Stano eventually adopted Zeininger, giving him her last name.\nDespite his foster parents being described as loving, Stano continued to have behavioral problems. He was a bed wetter until the age of 10.[2] In school, he earned Cs and Ds in all subjects except music (at which he excelled). He lied compulsively, and was once caught stealing money from his father's wallet to pay members of the track and field team to finish behind him, so he would not be viewed as a complete failure. During his youth, Stano was often bullied. At the age of 14, he was arrested for a false fire alarm and later for throwing rocks at cars from a highway bridge. Stano did not graduate high school until he was 21. After receiving his diploma, he enrolled in a computer school, graduated and began working in a local hospital. Soon after, he was fired for stealing from co-workers. After moving with his parents to Ormond Beach, Florida, he was fired from one job after another, mostly for theft or tardiness.[2] He also once impregnated a mentally disabled girl. Stano's parents paid for her abortion.\nStano was arrested on March 25, 1980 after attacking a woman named Donna Hensley, who escaped a hotel room and contacted authorities at a police station. Hensley would tell police that she was a prostitute, and had been approached by a man requesting her services. Once at her motel room, the two began to argue and the man ended up stabbing her thirty times with a knife before insulting her and fleeing. Stano was known to Hensley and local sex workers, and she was able to identify the man to authorities.[3]\nOfficially, Stano admitted that he began killing in the early 1970s, when he was in his twenties; however, he also claimed to have begun killing in the late 1960s, at the age of 18. Several girls had gone missing in Stano's area of residence at that time, but insufficient physical evidence was found when these claims were investigated almost twenty years later and Stano was never charged. He was most active in Florida and New Jersey. Stano admitted to committing his first murder in New Jersey in 1969. He also confessed to having killed six other women in Pennsylvania. \nAfter his moving to Florida he may have murdered 30 or more women. Most of Stano's victims were women in vulnerable circumstances, all except two were Caucasian and most of his known victims were between the ages of 16 and 25. He also confessed to killing a young woman in 1978 or 1979 whose body is still unidentified. Her remains were located in Daytona Beach in 1980. The confession was confirmed by his accurate memory of her clothing.[4] By his twenty-ninth birthday, Stano was in prison for allegedly murdering 41 women. He was housed with fellow serial killer Ted Bundy until the latter's execution in 1989.\nStano was found guilty of nine murders and received eight life sentences and one death sentence, the latter of which was carried out by electric chair on March 23, 1998, in Florida State Prison. For his final meal, Stano requested Delmonico steak, a baked potato with sour cream and bacon bits, salad with blue cheese dressing, lima beans, a half gallon of mint chocolate-chip ice cream, and 2 litres of Pepsi.[5] Stano's final statement proclaimed innocence and directed blame for his false confessions at the lead investigator, Paul Crow. He stated: \"I am innocent. I am frightened. I was threatened and I was held month after month without any real legal representation. I confessed to crimes I did not commit.\"[citation needed]\nThe following is a comprehensive list of all of Stano's officially confirmed murder victims:\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn Tuesday, November 12, 1914, John Evans, a black man, was lynched in St. Petersburg, Florida, United States, by a mob of 1,500 white men, women and children.[1] Evans was accused of the murder of Edward Sherman, a white real estate developer, and the attack of Sherman's wife, Mary. After word of the attack spread, and Mary Sherman claimed her attackers were \"two negroes,\" a citywide search ensued.[1] Suspicions immediately led to John Evans. Two days after the murder, a posse consisting of some of the city's most prominent and well-respected members stormed the St. Petersburg jail, threw a noose around Evans' neck and marched him to his death.[1] He was never given a fair trial.[2] Evans was hanged from a light post on the corner of Ninth Street South and Second Avenue. At first, he kept himself alive by wrapping his legs around the light pole. An unidentified white woman in a nearby automobile ended his struggle with a single bullet. Though the shot was fatal, the rest of the crowd began shooting at Evans' dangling body until their ammunition was depleted.[1][3]\nBetween 1882 and 1968, 4,743 people were reportedly lynched in the United States, 3,446 of whom were black. In 1914, the Tuskegee Institute reported that 51 of 55 lynching victims were black.[1] That same year the Crisis, a NAACP magazine, reported that 69 of 74 victims were black. In Florida, mobs lynched five victims. They were all black.[1] South Florida led the nation in lynchings per capita from 1900 to 1930.[4][5]\nAn editorial in the November 10 issue of the St. Petersburg Independent, published hours before the crimes, spoke optimistically of the city's future. A new gas plant and garbage incinerator were almost finished, a new library was under construction, a second railroad was being built, and the existing Atlantic Coast Line Railroad was heavily promoting the city.[1] During this time, St. Petersburg promoted itself as the \"cleanest, cheeriest, most comfortable little city in the south.\"[1]\nEdward Sherman was a 55-year-old photographer and land developer from Camden, New Jersey.[2] For several years he had operated a photography studio on Central Avenue, but in 1913 he directed his interests to real estate promotion.[1] He purchased an isolated stretch of land on John's Pass Road, now called Thirtieth Avenue North, and planned on turning it into St. Petersburg's newest suburb, called Wildwood Gardens. Apart from a single-story bungalow he built for himself and his wife, the land had yet to be developed. The property was half a mile from its nearest neighbor, which at the time was considered \"out in the country.\"[1]\nSherman had eleven black men working on his property. Until only a few days before the murder, John Evans had been one of them. Evans, who came from Dunnellon to St. Petersburg only a few weeks before, had been working for Sherman as a chauffeur and performing other odd jobs. On November 7, three days before the murder, Sherman fired Evans. The reason is unknown, but an acquaintance said that Evans seemed to carry a grudge.[1]\nOn the night of his death, Edward Sherman went to bed around 8 p.m., sleeping in an alcove with low narrow windows on either side and two larger ones in the front. His wife, Mary Sherman, was sitting in an adjoining parlor, making Christmas baskets out of grass and pine needles. At around 10 p.m., a shotgun was fired and Mrs. Sherman ran toward the bedroom where her husband lay, only to see the blast had blown his skull away.[1] She said a black man then stuck a gun in her face, demanded money and threatened to kill her. Though she handed over about a hundred dollars, Mrs. Sherman said a second black man dragged her outside, beat her with a pipe and ripped some of her clothes.[1] She did not explicitly say she was raped, but newspaper articles published after the fact implied she was. The two men ran off and Mrs. Sherman said she fainted. When she woke up to see her husband's corpse, she fainted again. She regained consciousness around 3 a.m. and stumbled over to a neighbor's house. The message was relayed from house to house until making it to one with a telephone. Police were notified of the incident and the word spread throughout the community that two black men had attacked the Shermans.[1] Mrs. Sherman was taken to Augusta Memorial Hospital where she was said to be \"hovering near death.\" As she came to, she told police she thought she recognized Evans' voice during the attack. Evans became the leading suspect. He was taken into police custody, but when brought before Mrs. Sherman for identification, she could not place him as her attacker and he was released.[1]\nA second man, Ebenezer B. Tobin, was also accused of the crime and was brought to the county jail in Clearwater, despite the arresting deputy's claim that he was not involved. Sheriffs kept news of the arrest quiet so mobs wouldn't be encouraged to infiltrate the jail and take matters into their own hands.[1]\nThe next morning, rumors spread through word of mouth and sensational newspaper headline. Anxiety and rage triggered a massive manhunt by armed whites. Hundreds of black men were detained and questioned, and in some cases roughed up.[1] Crowds dashed wildly around the city looking for suspects, some even scouring the woods north of town. The St. Petersburg Commission ordered all saloons be closed but Central Avenue remained crowded until midnight as white residents continued to speculate about the assailants' location.[1] Black people fled, many evacuating their own neighborhoods. Some took trains, some walked along the Atlantic Coast Line tracks, and some took boats.[1] About a hundred armed men surrounded Augusta Memorial Hospital, where they intended to prevent the escape of any suspect being brought before Mrs. Sherman.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "Frederick Pete Cox (born August 27, 1953) is an American serial killer. Formerly a telemarketer, in the span of a few months in 1997, he attacked five women in Orlando, Florida, killing three.[1] After an initial mistrial, Cox was found guilty at his second trial and sentenced to life imprisonment, plus 30 years for attempted murder.[2]\nBorn in the state capital of Tallahassee,[3] Cox moved to Orlando at an early age, graduating from Jones High School in 1972, after which he enlisted in the United States Army. He served for three years in West Germany, before receiving an honorable discharge and returning to Orlando.[4][1] He then served about 20 years in the United States Army Reserve's 143rd Transportation Command.[4] In the following years, he worked a number of jobs. He was an Orange County correctional officer for a few months in 1978, but was fired for falling asleep at work. Some years prior to his crime spree, he moved into a modest concrete house in Pine Hills, where he lived with his common law wife, two sons and two German shepherds.[4]\nDescribed by his neighbors as an unfriendly and rather quiet person, Cox was seen as a nice old man by family and relatives, who enjoyed talking to younger people and tinkering with his ham radio at home.[5] Due to a back injury he sustained in 1996, he was discharged from the army reserve and had to walk using a cane, but still managed to earn a living from his job as a telemarketer.[4]\nIn 1988, Cox was arrested for the first time at an adult book store named \"Red Garter\", after police found him masturbating on the premises. Charged with indecent exposure, he was to be put up for pre-trial diversion (since it was his first offense). However, before that could happen, in 1990, he was arrested yet again for possession of marijuana outside a Publix store parking lot. He pleaded no contest to the charges, and agreed to community service, additionally volunteering for \"Mothers Against Crack Cocaine\", an organization aimed at helping drug addicts recover. According to Mae Steger, the group's leader, Cox was an active and helpful participant.[4]\nCox's modus operandi involved driving around Orlando in his tan Buick Park Avenue and picking up women he thought to be prostitutes, shooting them afterwards.[1] The first to be attacked was 34-year-old Tracey Adams, who, unlike the victims that followed, had no connection to the sex industry. On March 12, she stopped at Pappy Kennedy and Florence Streets at around midnight, wanting to fix her flat tire.[3] In that moment, she was approached by Cox, whom incorrectly assumed that she was a prostitute, and asked her for sex. When Adams refused, he shot her in the right arm and sped off. Although she now has trouble moving her arm, Adams survived the attack without any greater injuries.[3]\nHe struck again on March 20, shooting dead execution-style 40-year-old prostitute Patricia Ann Logan, later dumping her naked body in a field near West Colonial Drive. Logan's body was found five days later by a hiker walking along a trail south from the highway along the shore of Lake Sherwood.[6]\nOn April 16, Cox approached 28-year-old Yolanda Neals, who was standing at Church Street and Tampa Avenue. He offered her $25 for sex, to which she agreed. Cox then drove Neals to a secluded area on Lively Street and Wallace Road,[3] near Universal Studios, parked the car and told her to get out so they could have sex. When she did, he opened fire, shooting Neals in the face, with the bullet exiting through her cheek.[4] Frightened, she fled while Cox continued to fire at her, succeeding in escaping, surviving her injuries, which left her with a lisp.[3]\nOn April 29, the killer struck for a final time, killing two more women within 24 hours of one another: 26-year-old Stephanie Singleton and 22-year-old Mary Ann Voepel. Both were transient, drug-addicted prostitutes who met each other in the Orange County Jail,[7][8] and smoked crack cocaine at an abandoned house in Orlando.[9] Their bodies were later found by a transient in the woods off the Americana Boulevard near Shingle Creek, close to the Interstate 4.[10] A few days later, they were positively identified as Singleton and Voepel. Authorities investigated a possible connection to two other murders that had occurred in the area, but determined that those killings were unrelated.[11]\nThe surviving victims, Adams and Neals, agreed to assist the detectives in their hunt for the serial killer. Neals helped develop an identikit and identified the car, while Adams confirmed the composite sketch, that she had seen her attacker and his car's license plate. With those clues, Cox was arrested on May 21, 1997, on attempted murder charges, much to the shock of his family and relatives, and held without bail.[12] Police thereafter searched his house and car, finding a 9mm pistol and blood on the carpet of his tan Buick.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Carol City murders were a series of murders that took place predominantly in Carol City, Florida and in and around Miami-Dade County between October 1974 and January 1978. The murders were committed by American mass murderer and serial killer John Errol Ferguson (February 27, 1948 \u2013 August 5, 2013)[1] who murdered at least eight people but is believed to have killed up to twelve. He was aided in six of the murders by two accomplices: Marvin Francois (January 18, 1946 \u2013 May 29, 1985)[2] and Beauford White (October 29, 1945 \u2013 August 28, 1987).[2]\nOn July 27, 1977, Ferguson, Francois, and White entered a drug house in Carol City where they tied up a total of eight people and shot all of them in the head execution-style. Only two of the eight survived. At the time, the incident was the largest case of mass murder in Miami-Dade County history. Months after the massacre, Ferguson murdered a teenage couple in Hialeah after raping the female victim. He is also suspected to be responsible for the May 1977 murders of an elderly couple and is suspected of killing a further two men in 1974.[3]\nFerguson, Francois, and White were all eventually captured, sentenced to death, and executed by the state of Florida. Francois was executed in the electric chair on May 29, 1985, followed by White, who was executed in the electric chair on August 28, 1987. Ferguson was executed over two decades later by lethal injection on August 5, 2013, following years of appeals over his sanity.[4][5]\nFerguson, the fourth oldest of eight children, had been known to psychiatrists since he was 10. His father died when he was 13 and his mother had managed to take care of the children on her own. Ferguson dropped out of school after repeating 9th grade three times.[6] Ferguson had his first police encounter when he was 13 after being caught driving someone else's car without their consent. He would continue to get in trouble with the police throughout his youth. In 1969, Ferguson tried to kill a police officer after a traffic stop. He disarmed officer Edward Hartman, ordered him on his knees, and told him to beg for his life. Hartman complied, but also slipped a revolver out of his boot. Ferguson fired four shots at Hartman but missed all of them. Hartman then shot Ferguson four times.[6]\nIn 1975, a court-appointed psychiatrist diagnosed John Ferguson as \"dangerous to himself and others ... homicidal ... a man who should not be released under any circumstances.\" Another psychiatrist said Ferguson's potential for recovery was minimal and that the probability of him returning to a life of crime was very high. He described Ferguson as \"explosive ... a dangerous person who cannot cope with day to day living.\" Ferguson bragged to his friends that he had feigned insanity and misled the doctors. A woman who knew him later said, \"He was into psychology. He told us he psyched them out. He'd say things like 'See that airplane flying in the room?'\"[6]\nAfter repeatedly escaping from a hospital, Ferguson, who had previously been acquitted of six robberies and two assaults on the grounds of insanity, was sent to the more secure Florida State Hospital. In June 1976, doctors said Ferguson's treatment was complete and that further hospitalization was not necessary. Ferguson was sent to Miami to face charges of resisting arrest after a hospital escape. Although a psychiatrist warned that he was \"unpredictable and a danger to himself and others\", a judge ruled Ferguson competent and later accepted a guilty plea. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison and two years of probation, and released 225 days later.[6]\nFrancois, whose parents were not married, had an impoverished upbringing. His father was a deadbeat heroin addict who brought other addicts into the home to take heroin in front of his son and beat Francois when he would not fight with the other children. Francois's mother was a sex worker who did not do much for her son. She married, but Francois's stepfather abused him. Although Francois did not finish school, he did obtain his GED.[7]\nWhite had a lengthy criminal record dating back to July 1963, and was on parole for assault with intent to commit rape at the time of the murders.[8]\nOn October 30, 1974, James Ward, a 40-year-old mental hospital escapee, was murdered. His body was dumped in Collier County and he was killed by a shotgun blast. On November 1, the body of another man named Joseph Walters was found near railroad tracks in Miami by a freight train employee. Walters had also been killed by a shotgun blast but had additionally been shot repeatedly with a handgun. There were no leads in the Walters case until February 1977, when the mother of the man convicted of Ward's murder made contact with Linda Blue, the lead homicide detective who was investigating the case. Convicted killer Edward Eugene Oliver had been spotted leaving the area where Ward's body had been found and was ultimately convicted of murdering him.

He was murdered in 2010, by a roommate.\nPerry wrote for the ThunderCats and Silverhawks television shows in the 1980s, as well as the comic book series Timespirits and ThunderCats, among others.\nIn 2008 Perry was diagnosed with bladder cancer which was operated on, but reemerged in the midst of financial troubles which prompted the help of The Hero Initiative.[3][4] His profile on Facebook reads, \"I discovered, a year ago, I had cancer when I walked into an Emergency Room with no insurance or no doctor. They removed a tumor, kicked me out after five days, and now the cancer is back. Thanks to the Hero Initiative, I survived long enough to get Medicaid and welfare, and now have Doctors, and can get the follow up care to try and survive the return of the cancer.\"[5]\nPerry released a statement in praise of the help he received from The Hero Initiative which stated, \"The Initiative gave me the breathing room to get some Medicaid and food stamps, and while we are always in danger of losing our home, electricity and belongings at any moment, I will always be grateful from the depths of my heart for the past six months of fairly solid home life I have had with my little boy.\"[3][4]\nSpurred on by Steve Bissette's plea to help his friend, fellow writer Elizabeth Massie headed a fundraiser for Perry on Facebook with the help of writer Laura Anne Gilman, and Horror World which started on May 3, 2010, and raised $1,140 by May 14.  By the end of that fundraiser, it had been a few days since friends or family had heard from Perry.\nAccording to news reports, Stephen Perry and his roommates, Roxanne and James Davis, disappeared from their home in Zephyrhills, Florida in May 2010, with the last sighting of him being on May 9.[1] The Davises were arrested on May 21 on \"probation and drug charges\".  In the parking lot of a Tampa, Florida motel on May 16, police found a severed arm in a van registered to Perry following complaints of a foul smell.[6]\nOver two weeks went by without public confirmation of his death, and on May 27, the Zephyrhills police confirmed that Steve Perry was the victim of a homicide.[1] The police have also been investigating whether there is a connection with a $10 million winning lottery ticket that was bought at a nearby store just before Perry disappeared.[7]\nJames Davis was eventually charged with first-degree murder in July 2010, although not all of Perry's remains had been found at that time.[8] The trial against James Davis began in May, 2022.[9]  The jury found Davis guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison, without possibility of parole.[10]\nOther reports include:\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn February 14, 2018, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Miami suburban town of Parkland, Florida, murdering 17 people[note 2] and injuring 17 others.[2][3][4] Cruz, a former student at the school, fled the scene on foot by blending in with other students, and was arrested without incident approximately one hour later in nearby Coral Springs.[5] Police and prosecutors investigated \"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\".[6]\nThe killing spree is the deadliest high school shooting in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre that killed 15, including the perpetrators, in Colorado in April 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

Convicted of two murders during his lifetime and executed in 2017,[2] he was posthumously linked via DNA to the third murder, for which another man was imprisoned.[3]\nOn May 2, 1983, Regina Harrison, a 20-year-old college student, left her parents' home for a nightly bike ride in Hollywood's North Beach neighborhood, but failed to return home.[4] Friends and family found her nude body in the woods in West Lake Park.[3] She had been strangled to death and her body discarded. During the subsequent investigation, witnesses reported that they had seen the woman riding accompanied by a skinny, long-haired man on a black bike.[4]\nThere were no leads in the case for five months, until a detective from Fort Lauderdale, John Curcio, saw a program airing the case on TV. He had been a member of an investigative unit which had captured Ronald Henry Stewart, a serial rapist who had terrorized women in Broward County and Harrison County, Mississippi during the late 1980s,[5] and took notice that Stewart resembled the suspect sketch, in addition to being in possession of a black bike at the time of his arrest.[4] A witness who said they had seen Regina and her alleged killer on the beach pointed to Ronald as the man she had seen, and he was soon charged with Harrison's murder. In order to avoid the death penalty, Stewart entered a plea of no contest and was given 50 years imprisonment in January 1985, to run concurrently with his other sentences for the sexual offenses.[3] Although several factors pointed towards his innocence in the case, including the fact that his fingerprints did not match those found at the crime scene, Stewart confessed to the crime. He never repudiated the confession nor claimed it was coerced while serving his time.[4] Stewart died behind bars from cancer in 2008.[5]\nLorraine \"Lori\" Anne Barrett, a 32-year-old tourist from Bridgeville, Pennsylvania was last seen at the Elbo Room, a bar located at the corner of Las Olas Boulevard and A1A State Road.[3] According to witnesses, she was accompanied by a heavily tattooed man to her motel room at the Days Inn Lauderdale Surf Motel on Seabreeze Boulevard. At about noon on June 1, 1991, her body was found by a cleaning lady. She had been raped and strangled.[6]\nImmediately following the body's discovery, police created a facial composite, complete with descriptions of the suspect's tattoos (barbed wire and hearts etched with names), and distributed it around Broward County. However, it was to no avail, and the case quickly went cold.[6]\nOn June 6, 1995, Mary Phillips and her 11-year-old daughter, Lacey, were attacked at her office in Bald Knob, Arkansas.[7] Jones, equipped with latex gloves, a wire, and a BB gun, broke into the office,[8] raped and murdered Mary, and beat Lacey so brutally that she appeared dead.[9] Jones tied the child to a chair in the bathroom and left.\nThe local sheriff's department dispatched three officers to the scene. Upon arrival, they believed Lacey was deceased due to the severity of her injuries. While taking flash photographs of the crime scene, an officer noticed that one of Lacey's eyes was focused on him.[9] She was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. Once her condition stabilized, she gave a description of her assailant, a man with a tattoo around his eye. The officers present during her interview readily identified the man she described as Jack Harold Jones, an Ohio native who was well known to police. Jones was brought in for interrogation and confessed to the crime. He was brought to trial, found guilty, and sentenced to death for killing Mary Phillips.[9]\nWhile awaiting execution on Arkansas\u2019s Death Row, Jones's DNA was entered into CODIS, the nationwide DNA database. Years later, in 2003, it was matched to the DNA evidence of the Lori Barrett case. A second test was conducted at the state crime lab in Arkansas, which conclusively proved that Jack Jones was the perpetrator. The Florida authorities issued an extradition warrant for Jones, who by this time was appealing his death sentence in Arkansas for the third time.[6] He was eventually tried for the Barrett murder, found guilty, sentenced to life imprisonment, and returned to await his execution back in Arkansas.[10]\nOver the years, Jones's execution was stayed several times, due to illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes, which resulted in one of his legs being amputated.[4] According to his sister Lynn, Jack had suffered sexual and physical abuse as a child, which led to alcohol and drug dependency.[3] His sister's statements notwithstanding, Jones himself expressed regret over his actions and agreed with his sentence, explaining that he was haunted by the ghosts of his victims and was incapable of forgiving himself for what he did.[8]\n",

His 14-year-old daughter Jaime Guttenberg[1] was murdered in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on February 14, 2018. His son, Jesse, also a student at the school, ran from the shooting to meet him at a nearby store.[2] He learned about his daughter's death from a friend who is a Coral Springs SWAT officer.[3] Jessica McBride, for the website Heavy, described him as \"one of the strongest voices for changes to gun laws in the wake of the mass shooting\".[4]\nThe day after the shooting, Guttenberg spoke out for gun control, stating \"Don't tell me there's no such thing as gun violence. It happened in Parkland\".[5] Before the nationally televised CNN town hall he criticized the President for not saying guns are a problem in a White House listening session, saying \"My daughter was hunted last week\" and \"I am enraged\".[6][7] During the CNN town hall he confronted Florida Senator Marco Rubio for his position on guns.[8][9]\nAccording to a report in The Guardian, Guttenberg's priorities include raising the minimum age to buy guns, adding a waiting period before gun sales, having a no-loopholes policy for a mandatory background check of the gun buyer, and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and bump stocks.[3] While he would prefer that assault-style weapons were banned entirely, he believes that given the current political reality, that such a ban would be unlikely to ever happen, and accordingly he is advocating for measures to reduce gun violence which have a realistic chance of passage.[3]\nHe told the Tampa Bay Times in March 2018 he has dedicated the rest of his life to fighting for gun safety.[10]\nHe is a staunch critic of the National Rifle Association as well as its spokesperson Dana Loesch, and he criticized the NRA advertisement entitled Time Is Running Out, saying if a terrorist organization released a similar video, the terror threat level would raise.[11] He told lawmakers that \"All our legislators who stand with the NRA, they\u2019re standing with a terrorist group.\"[3] He called on President Donald Trump to address threats made against survivors and their families and demand such behavior stop.[12][13]\nGuttenberg noted that guns were prohibited by the Secret Service at the NRA convention in Dallas when vice president Mike Pence is scheduled to speak, and criticized the decision as hypocritical.[14] Guttenberg said:\nAccording to the NRA, we should want everyone to have weapons when we are in public ... But when they put on a convention, the weapons are a concern? I thought giving everyone a gun was to enhance safety.In early March 2018 he traveled to Washington to speak at a US Senate hearing[15][16] about taking steps to prevent further violence. While in the Washington area he spoke at a town hall in Alexandria, Virginia.[17][18][19] Guttenberg's advocacy has been characterized by his refusal to sit down, with Democratic Florida Senator Bill Nelson explaining that Guttenberg \"cannot talk about this sitting down.\"[3]\n",

At his apartment in Orlando, Florida, he was shot dead by FBI agent Aaron McFarlane during a police interview on May 22, 2013. He had allegedly attacked the agent, with a pipe or stick, while writing a statement about the Boston Marathon bombings and a triple homicide that took place in Waltham, Massachusetts, on September 11, 2011. The investigators involved in the incident said that Todashev had implicated both himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the Waltham murders before he was killed.\nIbragim Todashev was born on September 22, 1985, in the Chechen-Ingush capital Grozny during the Soviet era, as the eldest of 12 children of Abdulbaki (or Abdul-Baki) Todashev and his two wives.[1] During the 1990s, his family fled war-torn Chechnya to Russia's Saratov Oblast. They resided there until the late 2000s, before moving back to Grozny, where his father became a high-ranking pro-Moscow official in the city administration in 2008.[2][3]\nTodashev moved to the U.S. to study English on a J-1 non-immigrant visa, after four years of study in classes at Saratov State University and Chechen State University, as part of a student exchange program with Russia. He then applied for and was granted asylum in 2008 and permanent residence in March 2013.[2][3][4] His father said his son had no reason to fear \"oppression\" back home as \"he was too young to fight in the war [in Chechnya], and he has nothing to fear here now\" from the authorities.[5] He said: \"Out of fear of the lawlessness in Chechnya, I sent him to the U.S. because it seemed like the safest country at the time.\"[6]\nIn the United States, Todashev married an Armenian American, Reni Manukyan, who said she met him in 2010 through a mutual friend in Boston; Manukyan separated from Todashev in November 2012, but they had kept in regular contact with each other, and she was still supporting him with money.[7] Todashev was an amateur boxer before turning to mixed martial arts (MMA) in the United States, but he was to quit his professional MMA career due to a serious knee injury. His father said that after that, his son had held various jobs in the Boston area before eventually moving to Florida.[6]\nHis father said in an interview for Russia Today that his son was a \"very calm\" person who would never hurt anyone.[7] Todashev's former MMA training partner, however, described him as a gifted athlete but also a \"hothead\".[8] In 2010, the Boston Police Department detained Todashev for a violent road rage incident in Downtown Crossing; the police report states that the officers \"witnessed several people struggling to restrain a white male, later determined to be the subject, Ibragim Todashev. Officers heard Todashev yell, 'You say something about my mother, I will kill you!' Officers struggled to physically restrain and handcuff Todashev.\"[9] On May 4, 2013, shortly before his death, he was also briefly arrested by the Orange County Sheriff's Office in Orange County, Florida, after he got into a fight with two strangers during a dispute over a parking space at an outlet mall, knocking one of them unconscious and then leaving the scene (the man, who was hospitalized with serious head injuries but did not press charges,[1] later said he was shocked \"how accurate and quick his punches were\" and \"thought he was wearing brass knuckles, but it was just his fist\").[8] The responding sheriff's deputy chased down Todashev's car, ordered him out at gunpoint and arrested him; the affidavit states that \"Todashev said he was only fighting to protect his knee because he had surgery in March.\"[10]\nAt the time of the shooting that killed him, Todashev was free on $3,500 bail for the Orange County incident, facing charges of aggravated battery.[9][11][12] While his girlfriend had been ordered to return to Russia by an immigration judge, federal immigration officials granted her permission to stay in the United States for another year and released her from detention in August.[13] After speaking to reporter Susan Zalkind about Todashev's death and relationship with the FBI, she was arrested and deported to Russia in October 2013.[11] Todashev's friend who was also a housemate, Ashurmamad Miraliev, briefly charged in an unrelated case, was ordered to leave the country and left soon afterwards.[14][15]\nA triple murder was committed in Waltham, Massachusetts, on the evening of September 11, 2011.[18][19] Three men, Brendan Mess, Erik Weissman, and Raphael Teken, were murdered in Mess's apartment. All had their throats slit from ear to ear, with such great force that they were nearly decapitated. Illegal marijuana worth thousands of dollars was left covering their bodies, and $5,000 was left at the scene. The local district attorney said that it appeared that the killer and the victims knew each other, and that the murders were not random.\nThe Boston Globe reported that Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the deceased suspect in the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, had once introduced murder victim Brendan Mess as his best friend.[18] After the bombings and subsequent revelations of Tsarnaev's personal life, the Waltham murders case was reexamined in April 2013 with Tsarnaev as a new suspect.[6] Todashev's friendship with Tsarnaev then led to him being questioned for potential connection with the murders and other actions involving Tsarnaev.\n",

Gore was executed by lethal injection in 2012, having been on Florida's death row for 28 years.\nGore had an accomplice, his cousin Fred Waterfield, and the pair were dubbed the \"Killing Cousins\".[1]  Waterfield was convicted of two murders, and is currently serving two consecutive life sentences.\nIn 1976 (prior to their committing any murders), police jailed and questioned both Gore and Waterfield after Angela Hommell Austin (age 20) accused them of raping her at gunpoint. The cousins insisted the sex was consensual, and they were not charged in her case.[2] Gore targeted at least four additional women who escaped with their lives.[2]\nDavid Alan Gore was born on August 21, 1953, in Florida. When he was a teenager, he was fired from his first job as a gas station attendant after his boss found a hole that allowed Gore to look into the women's bathroom.[1] Gore was an auxiliary sheriff's deputy and used his badge to commit some of his crimes.[1] Gore also worked as a caretaker of a citrus grove that provided a secluded area in which to rape and murder his victims.[3]\nFred Waterfield was born on September 29, 1952, in New Jersey.[4] He is a former high school football player.[1]\nGore and Waterfield came to an arrangement, namely that Gore would spot, stalk, and secure potential victims for himself and Waterfield, in exchange for cash payments from Waterfield.[3]\nGore's and Waterfield's first two murder victims were Ying Hua Ling (age 17) and her mother Hsiang Huang Ling (age 48). On February 19, 1981, Gore accosted Ying Ling and brandished his auxiliary police badge to lure the teenager into his truck, after which he drove her to her own home. Once there, he encountered Hsiang Ling and kidnapped both women. Gore later claimed that the mother, tied to a tree, slowly choked to death while he and Waterfield raped the daughter. The pair dismembered the two women and stuffed their body parts into oil drums, which they buried.\nThe pair's third victim was Judith Daley (age 35), a former Fort Pierce resident visiting from California. On July 15, 1981, Gore disabled Daley's car at the beach, and then offered her a ride to the nearest telephone. Gore drove Daley to a secluded area and met Waterfield, whereupon both men raped Daley. Gore claimed to have disposed of Daley's body in a swamp.[3]\nOne week after Daley's murder, Gore unsuccessfully attempted to abduct a teenage girl using his auxiliary badge. The girl's father filed a complaint, and Gore was stripped of his badge. Days later, police spotted Gore hiding in the back seat of a woman's car, carrying a police scanner, handcuffs, and a pistol. Gore was convicted of armed trespassing and sentenced to five years in prison, but was released on parole in March 1983.[3]\n",

Their mother, Julie Powers Schenecker, was arrested on suspicion of their murder after a confession.\nOn January 29, Schenecker was admitted to Tampa General Hospital, but was released the next day. She was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, and indicted by grand jury on February 9. Seven days later, she entered a plea of not guilty, with her legal team indicating they would pursue a defense on the grounds of insanity. Parker Schenecker divorced his wife in May 2011, and subsequently filed a civil lawsuit for wrongful deaths, following dispute over distribution of the family's assets.\nJulie Schenecker's criminal trial began on April 28, 2014.[1] She was found guilty of first-degree murder and was sentenced to two concurrent life terms in prison on May 15, 2014.[2]\nJulie Powers Schenecker (born January 13, 1961, in Muscatine, Iowa) lived in Tampa, Florida, with her husband, U.S. Army Colonel Parker Schenecker, and their two children.[3] The couple met in Germany during the 1980s, where Julie Powers was working as a Russian linguist.[4]\nAt the time of Calyx and Beau's deaths, Parker Schenecker was overseas. Their daughter, Calyx, was 16 and son, Beau, was 13 at the time of their deaths. According to the New York Daily News, the children were described as \"cheerful and seemingly happy.\"[5]\nPolice visited the Schenecker home November 6, 2010, to investigate an allegation of child abuse made by Calyx.[6] No charges were filed against Schenecker, but according to the police report, Schenecker acknowledged that she had hit her daughter.[6] Calyx told a counselor in her once-a-week therapy appointment that her mother had hit her in the face when they were heading home from cross-country practice on November 2, 2010, according to the police report.[6] Investigators that visited the home said  no injuries were visible on Calyx when the report was filed four days later. Calyx had told investigators that Schenecker had \"hit her with an open hand on her face for approximately 30 seconds\", according to the report.[6]\nOn January 28, 2011, police visited the property after receiving a call from Schenecker's mother, who expressed concern at not being able to reach her daughter.[5] Officers found Beau Schenecker in a sport utility vehicle in the garage and Calyx Schenecker in her bedroom; both had been shot with a .38 revolver and covered with blankets.[7] Julie Schenecker was found unconscious on the rear porch covered in blood.[8]\nPolice stated that Schenecker admitted to killing her children because they \"talked back and were mouthy\".[8] A police statement said, \"She described the crimes in detail.\"[8] A note was allegedly found in the house describing a plan to murder her children and commit suicide.[4] According to the arrest affidavit, Beau was shot twice in the head on January 27 while being driven by his mother from soccer practice.[9] Schenecker then drove home and killed Calyx in her room as she was doing her homework on her computer.[5][10] The revolver had been purchased five days before the killings.[8] Calyx was found on her bed covered by a blanket.[11]\n",

He died at his Pinecrest, Florida home on May 18, 2008, of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.[2][3]\nBetween August 23, 1999, and October 27, 1999, James committed a series of intrusions into various systems, including those of BellSouth and the Miami-Dade school system.[4] What brought him to the attention of federal authorities, however, was his intrusion into the computers of the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), a division of the United States Department of Defense, the primary function of which is to analyze potential threats to the United States of America, both at home and abroad. James later admitted to authorities that he had installed an unauthorized backdoor in a computer server in Dulles, Virginia, which he used to install a sniffer that allowed him to intercept over three thousand messages passing to and from DTRA employees, along with numerous usernames and passwords of other DTRA employees, including at least 10 on official military computers.[1]\nIt was later revealed that the precise software obtained was the International Space Station's source code controlling critical life-sustaining elements. According to NASA, \"the software supported the International Space Station's physical environment, including control of the temperature and humidity within the living space.\"[5]\nJames' house was raided on January 26, 2000, by agents from the Department of Defense, NASA and the Pinecrest Police Dept. James was formally indicted six months later. On September 21, 2000, he entered into an agreement with U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis: he would plead guilty to two counts of juvenile delinquency in exchange for a lenient sentence.[1]\nJames was sentenced to seven months house arrest and probation until the age of eighteen and was required to write letters of apology to NASA and the Department of Defense. He was also banned from using computers for recreational purposes.[6] James later violated that probation when he tested positive for drug use and was then subsequently taken into custody by the United States Marshals Service and flown to an Alabama federal correctional facility where he ultimately served six months.[3]\nLegal experts have suggested that, given the extent of his intrusions, he could have served at least ten years for his crimes if he had been an adult.\nBoth Attorney General Janet Reno and prosecuting attorney Guy Lewis issued statements claiming the James case was proof the Justice Department was willing to get tough with juvenile offenders accused of cybercrime.[7]\nOn January 17, 2008\n, department store chain TJX was the victim of a massive computer systems intrusion that compromised the personal and credit information of millions of customers. The same ring of hackers also committed intrusions on BJ's Wholesale Club, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21, DSW, OfficeMax, and Dave & Buster's, and reportedly made a millionaire out of the group's ringleader, Albert Gonzalez. Though he denied having done anything, James\u2014who was friends with some of the hackers involved\u2014was investigated by the Secret Service, who raided James', his brother's, and his girlfriend's houses. Although they apparently discovered no connection to the intrusion, they did discover a legally owned firearm, which they did not take, and notes indicating he had considered killing himself; James' father would later say that his son had been prone to depression. The criminal complaint filed against the TJX hackers mention an additional, unnamed conspirator who was not indicted, who is identified only by the initials \"J.J.\". In 2004, this co-conspirator assisted one of the hackers in stealing credit card numbers, account numbers, and encrypted PINs from an OfficeMax store via Wi-Fi. These numbers were later allegedly provided to Albert Gonzalez, for whom \"J.J.\" also opened a mail drop. James's father believes \"J.J.\" to have been his son.[3] However, it is plausible that the initials \"J.J.\" may in fact have been referring to \"Jim Jones\", a (hacker) alias believed to be used by Stephen Watt who was a close friend of computer hacker and criminal Albert Gonzalez.[8]\nOn May 18, 2008, Jonathan James was found dead in his shower with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. His suicide was allegedly motivated by the belief that he would be prosecuted for crimes he had not committed. \"I honestly, honestly had nothing to do with TJX,\" James wrote in his suicide note, \"I have no faith in the 'justice' system. Perhaps my actions today, and this letter, will send a stronger message to the public. Either way, I have lost control over this situation, and this is my only way to regain control.\"[3]\n",

[1] The murder would be adapted into the 2001 film Bully.\nBobby Kent, the son of Iranian immigrants Fred and Farah Kent (originally surnamed Khayam),[2] attended South Broward High School in the South Florida suburb of Hollywood, Florida.[3] According to Tim Donnelly, who prosecuted all the conspirators for this murder, one attorney described Kent as \"like Eddie Haskell. All the parents loved him in the neighborhood, but the kids looked at him a different way.\"[4]\nMarty Puccio is an Italian-American, and was raised Catholic.[5] Kent and Puccio had known each other since third grade, had lived on the same block in Hollywood, Florida since that time, and were good friends as teenagers. Bad blood, however, existed between the two. Puccio felt \"ill-will and hatred\" towards Kent, who would bully and pummel him.[6]\nBoth sets of parents were wary of the friendship as well. Puccio's parents, Martin Sr. and Veronica, were concerned because Marty often returned from being with Kent bleeding or covered in bruises. Fred Kent thought of Puccio as a wayward slacker who had no future (Puccio was a high school dropout) and felt the friendship with his son would destroy the future he was helping him build. Frequent gym-goers, both boys were rumored to use steroids, which, in Kent's case, according to testimonial accounts, significantly contributed to his erratic, aggressive behavior.[citation needed]\nKent and Puccio had experimented with making gay porn movies, hoping to distribute them to local shops. Neither Kent nor Puccio actually participated in these movies, but, rather, allegedly directed them and coaxed a Florida man in his 40s to perform on camera. Kent tried to peddle a movie, titled Rough Boys, to porn shops across South Florida. None took him up on the offer, due to the poor audio and video quality as well as the lack of any sexual activities in the film beyond the man dancing nude and playing with a dildo.[7]\nToward the beginning of 1993, Puccio (aged 20) began dating Lisa Connelly (aged 18). Frustrated by how much time Puccio spent with Kent (aged 20) as well as Kent's treatment of Puccio, Connelly tried to distract Kent from Puccio by setting up her friend Alice \"Ali\" Willis (aged 17) with Kent.[8] Kent and Willis dated for a few weeks, but she ultimately ended the relationship because he was abusive.[9] In June, Puccio confided to Connelly that Kent had been abusive to him quite often over the years. Connelly tried to convince him to end the friendship, but Puccio seemed hesitant. By this time, Connelly knew she was pregnant with Puccio's child, and was determined to pursue a permanent relationship with him.[10]\nAllegedly, Connelly decided that Kent needed to be eliminated permanently, and began talking to Puccio and other friends about murdering him.[11] On July 13, 1993, Connelly called Willis and told her that \"Bobby Kent was planning to come to Palm Bay, Florida, where Willis was living, to murder her and smother her baby [by a previous relationship], unless she returned to Broward County to date him again.\"[12] Willis claimed Connelly asked her to come to Connelly's house to discuss murdering Bobby Kent. Willis went to Connelly's house and brought two friends, her current boyfriend, Donald Semenec (aged 17), and Heather Swallers (aged 18).[13]\nOn the night of July 13, 1993, Puccio, Semenec, Swallers, Connelly and Willis met with Kent. Puccio, Semenec, and Swallers became uncomfortable and left. Connelly and Willis lured Kent to a new development under construction with the promise that he would be able to drive Willis' Mustang 5.0 and have sex with her.[14] Connelly had brought along her mother's pistol, intending to kill Kent while he was distracted by sexual activity with Willis, but was unable to go through with shooting him.[15]\nDespite the failed attempt, Connelly still wanted Kent dead. Seeking assistance, she contacted a self-proclaimed hitman named Derek Kaufman (aged 20), who had been recommended by a friend of Willis'. The group met Kaufman at his home in Rolling Oaks, Florida.[16] They wanted him to get a gun so they could kill Kent that night, but Kaufman told them he couldn't procure a weapon that quickly. Willis, Connelly, Semenec and Swallers then went back to Connelly's house and were joined by her cousin, Derek Dzvirko (aged 19).[17] The group continued to discuss their plans, and ultimately decided to go ahead with murdering Kent the next night, with Kaufman's assistance.[18]\n",

Aside from his political radio commentary, Dor was both on the board of directors and worked as a paralegal at the Haitian Refugee Center, in addition to his involvement in multiple community education programs. He worked at WLQY-AM (1320) as a pro-democratic and pro-Aristide Creole-language commentator and political reporter.[2]\nAfter receiving several threats, D'Or was fatally shot four times and killed by Billy Alexander for US $2,000 at 8:55\u00a0p.m. on Friday, March 15, 1991. At the time he was standing outside his office close to the intersection of Northeast Second Avenue and 59th Street in Little Haiti, in Miami, Florida.[2][3][4] Police later found a death list with d'Or's name on it, as well as two other prominent Haitian journalists.[5][6]\nBilly Alexander, a Haitian American, was convicted of killing d'Or. It was alleged that Alexander, born ca. 1970, was contracted to kill d'Or for his opposition to Louis Thermitus, a local record store owner, who d'Or had accused of being a member of the Tonton Macoute and of supporting the regime that had ousted Haiti's elected President Aristide. At the time of his arraignment and later his conviction for the murder of d'Or and Jean-Claude Olivier, another radio journalist, Alexander was serving a life sentence for killing Alcee Lissitte during an unrelated incident of robbery.[7][8][9][10][11] The lookout man for the contract killing, Glossy Bruce Joseph, was arrested in May 1991 and later convicted and sentenced to 25 years in 1993.[12][13] Hitler Fleurinord was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and accused of being the driver.[7] Thermitus was never implicated or charged in the murders.[6][11]\nThe Haitian community in Little Haiti, Miami, numbered 60,000 people.[1] The murder of Fritz d'Or took place there after the Haitian general election, 1990\u20131991 produced Haiti's first democratically elected president and after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide assumed power in February 1991. The Haitian refugee community was divided over the ouster of Aristide by the military regime.\nThe first political violence was the murder on 18 February 1991 of another reporter, Jean-Claude Olivier, who held similar pro-democracy views as d'Or.[2] At first, police could not connect the two murders; however, other killings and attacks took place. Ringo Cayard, another radio talk show host with pro-democracy views, owned a building that was destroyed by an explosion one week after d'Or was murdered.[14] Dona St. Plite was the third journalist killed when he was at a benefit for d'Or's family on 24 October 1993.[15] The fourth murder, on 9 March 1994, was political activist Daniel Buron, who like d'Or was a member of Veye Yo. Police believed all four cases were similar because each victim was outspoken and advocated for Aristide and democracy.[16]\nThe murder of Fritz d'Or was the second in a string of political attacks by supporters of the former Haitian military regime who were opposed to Aristide. Jean-Claude Olivier was killed 18 February 1991. The attacks caught attention of the Haitian community. The [17] There was further interest in whether the murders were ordered by the Haitian military regime as that could possibly change the status of refugees from economic to political asylum seekers.[13]\nDor's murder also helped raise awareness of the dangers of ethnic journalism. By the time that d'Or was killed, there had already been eight journalists murdered since 1982, making ethnic journalism one of the field's most hazardous jobs. Most of those murders remained unsolved.[18] While there have been more since Fritz d'Or's own murder, the media has deepened scrutiny into the matter.[19][20]\nFritz d'Or is one of eleven ethnic journalists to be killed in the United States since 1977, which includes Chauncey Bailey.[18][19][20]\nOne thousand people marched through the streets of Little Haiti to protest that no arrests had been in the murder of Olivier and d'Or and within one week the alleged lookout man was arrested.[1][12]\n",

When Mizell rode to collect taxes from Barber, he was waylaid and killed.[1] In the resultant feud, 41 men were killed.[2][3][4]\nBarber, a staunch Confederate supporter, did not want to pay taxes to the government and felt that Mizell\u2014himself a Confederate veteran\u2014was a carpetbagging traitor out to exploit his former comrades. As a result of the man's non-compliance, Mizell repeatedly took Barber's cattle as payment for taxes.

Although the dying sheriff asked his family not to avenge his death, they nevertheless went on a revenge spree which was reciprocated by the Barbers and their supporters.

        "paragraph": "The Sarasota Assassination Society, also known as the Sarasota Vigilance Committee,[1] was a late 19th-century secret organization established by Alfred Bidwell, Dr. Leonard Andrews and Jason Alford in Manatee County, Florida. The organization, which was estimated to include twenty to twenty-two members, was purported to be a political social group or a Democratic Club.[2] The true aims of the group were chronicled in the February 2, 1885 New York Times article; \"This organization is supposed to exist for the purpose of the secret murder of political opponents, and is composed of 20 members, bound together by terrible oaths to perform the bloody work of the band and to keep its secrets inviolate.\"[3]\nThe Sarasota Vigilance Committee actively recruited new members from the community and subsequently controlled their ranks through intimidation, fear, and coercion. Members were obligated to actively seek jury service in matters involving other members, assist in the escape of members who were incarcerated, and ultimately, murder those individuals opposed by the group.[4] The group was organized by Alfred Bidwell and Dr. Leonard Andrews, who referred to themselves as \"judges,\" while members Jason Alford, \"captain,\" Louis Cato and Charles Willard, \"lieutenants,\" constituted the remaining command structure of the organization.[5]\nNotoriety for the Sarasota Vigilance Committee came with the murders of Charles E. Abbe and Harrison T. Riley. Abbe, who was painting the hull of an upturned boat with friend, Charles Morehouse, was shot in the face with a double-barreled shotgun.[4] Riley was ambushed while on horseback and shot in the head and body. His murderers completed their heinous act by slitting his throat.[4] Though the murders occurred some six months apart, Riley's death was unsolved until the investigation of Charles Abbe's homicide.\nIn her article \"He Has Carried His Life in His Hands\": The Sarasota Assassination Society of 1884, Janet Snyder Matthews argues against the notion that the group had acted out of some fundamental belief that they (Sarasota Vigilance Committee) were actually defending early settlers from the excesses of land speculators. Matthews cites Karl H. Grismer's book The Story of Sarasota as the source for this theory. Contrary to Grismer's supposition, Matthews reports that the murders of Abbe and Riley were almost certainly committed to personally benefit the leadership of the Sarasota Vigilance Committee. The ultimate purpose of the organization was to plan and carry out the murders of five of Manatee County's most notable and important figures: Charles E. Abbe, Harrison T. Riley, Robert Greer, Furman Whitaker, and Stephen Goings.[6]\nIn total, nine members of the Sarasota Vigilance Committee were indicted for the murders of Charles E. Abbe and Harrison T. Riley. The indictments lead to the trials of eight men, with three being sentenced to death, four receiving life sentences, and one being acquitted. Two of those sentenced to death later escaped from prison, and the remaining one had his death sentence commuted to life in prison.[7]\nIn 1877, Charles Elliot Abbe, his wife, Charlotte, and their two teenage daughters, Carrie and Nellie, moved to Manatee County, Florida from Chicago, Illinois. Abbe had made a handsome fortune as a salesman with the Singer Sewing Machine Company in Kansas.[8] Having vacationed in Florida during the two previous years, Abbe became enthralled with the possibility of commercial success in Manatee County.[9]\nBetween 1876 and 1878, Abbe purchased several hundred undeveloped acres from the state, as well as private land owners, in what is modern-day Sarasota.[10] In addition to land acquisition, Abbe maintained a general store in the family's home and served as the area's first postmaster.[8] Seeking to promote settlement in the area, Abbe often marketed Manatee County in his travels around the North, especially at local fairs and exhibitions.[11] An active local politician and newspaper contributor, Abbe was just one of the county's 216 registered Republicans.[10] With the marriage of their daughter Nellie to neighbor, Furman Whitaker, the Abbes were solidifying their place in the community.[10]\nAs Abbe's success and fortune grew, so did the resentment and animosity felt by Alfred Bidwell and other members of the small rural community. Instances of vandalism to Abbe's properties increased in the two years before his murder.[12] The harassment eventually turned violent with gunfire being directed at the Abbe residence while Mrs. Abbe was home alone. Mrs. Abbe also reported finding a dirk knife stuck in a table outside of her residence.[12]\nOn December 27, 1884, Charles Abbe and friend, Charles Morehouse, were painting a boat on a road leading to the beach, when Charles Willard and Joseph Anderson approached them. Willard, who was wielding Anderson's double-barreled shotgun, pointed the firearm at Abbe and shot him in the face.[4] He then turned and pointed the shotgun at Morehouse, ordering him to run for his life.[13] Willard and Anderson dragged Abbe's lifeless body to a wharf near Bidwell's store, loaded it on a boat and dumped it in the Gulf of Mexico, some three miles off shore.[1]\n",

He was lynched for having given Christmas cards to all his co-workers at the Van Priest Dime Store, including Cynthia Goff, a white girl, followed by a letter to her on New Year's Day.\nThe New Year's Day letter read:\nDear Friend,\nJust a few line[s] to let you hear from me [.] I am well an[d] hope you are the same. This is what I said on that [C]hristmas card. From W. J. H. With L. [love] I hope you will understand what I mean.

McCullers and Reg H. Scott, allegedly went to Willie's house and took the youth from his mother at gunpoint. They picked up Willie's father, James Howard, at the Bond-Howell Lumber Company where he worked, then drove to the Suwannee River east of Suwannee Springs, where they bound Willie by the hands and feet, and forced the youth to choose between getting shot and jumping into the Suwannee River. After his father said he could do nothing to save him, Willie jumped into the river and drowned. Goff, McCullers, and Scott signed an affidavit which stated that they had only wanted James Howard to whip his son and, rather than be whipped by his father, Willie had committed suicide by jumping into the river. James Howard also signed the affidavit, but after selling his home and moving to Orlando, he recanted. Harry T. Moore, of the NAACP, interviewed the parents. After a county grand jury failed to indict, Moore was able to get a federal investigation started, but no convictions followed. Goff, McCullers, and Scott died without having to face murder charges.[2]\nA documentary film on the murder, Murder on the Suwannee River, was produced in 2006 by Marvin Dunn, a historian, who tried to get Charlie Crist, then attorney general and later governor of Florida, to reopen the case, but to no avail; neither was his case investigated under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act.[3] It is frequently cited as comparable to the case of Emmett Till, who was also lynched (at age 14) for allegedly making advances at a white woman at a grocery store.[4]\nTameka Hobbs wrote about the lynching and three other lynchings in her 2015 book Democracy Abroad, Lynching at Home: Racial Violence in Florida.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn December 19, 1959, Christine and Cliff Walker and their two children were murdered at their home in Osprey, Florida. The case is unsolved as of January 2023.\nAuthorities believe that 24-year-old Christine Walker arrived at the family's farm home around 4pm on Saturday, December 19, 1959, where she was raped, then murdered by gunshot.[1] Her husband Cliff, 25, then arrived with their 3-year-old son Jimmie and 1-year-old daughter Debbie. Cliff was ambushed and killed by gunshot.[2] Jimmie and Debbie were then murdered. Jimmie was shot, and Debbie was shot in addition to being drowned in the bathtub. The actual cause of death is unknown, and she could have been shot in the bathtub.[3][4] News stories noted there were gifts around the Christmas tree.[5]\nPhysical evidence left at the scene included a bloody cowboy boot, a cellophane strip from a Kool cigarette wrapper, and a fingerprint on the bathtub faucet handle.[6]\nA serial killer named Emmett Monroe Spencer confessed to the murders, but the confession was discredited by Sarasota County Sheriff Ross Boyer, who labeled Spencer a pathological liar.[7] Spencer's confession was \"determined to be cleverly constructed from real murders written up in newspapers and true-crime novels that he liked to read.\"[8]  In 1994, a bartender in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania contacted the Sarasota County Sheriff\u2019s Office, claiming that one of her customers had boasted of killing the Walker family; this tip was never verified.[9]\nPolice never identified a motive, and 587 people were suspects at one time or another.[6] The case remains open.\nIn 2012, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office began investigating possible links between the Walker family murders and Perry Smith and Richard \"Dick\" Hickock, who had been convicted and executed for the 1959 murders of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas. The Clutter murders were the topic of Truman Capote's 1965 best-selling true crime book In Cold Blood. While that book devoted several pages to the Walker case, it dismissed a possible connection to Hickock and Smith, asserting that the two men had an alibi for that day. However, records and witness accounts collected by Kansas and Florida investigators show several factual contradictions in Capote's account.[10]\nThe Sheriff's Office admitted that Hickock and Smith had been considered suspects as far back as 1960. After killing four members of the Clutter family in Kansas, 34 days before the Walker murders, Smith and Hickock fled to Florida in a stolen car, and were spotted at least a dozen times between Tallahassee and Miami.[5] The pair checked into a Miami Beach motel, about four hours from Osprey, and checked out on the morning of the Walker murders. At some point that day, Smith and Hickock bought items at a Sarasota department store, just a few miles from the Walker home. One witness said that the taller of the two men \"had a scratched-up face.\"[5] The pair was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 30, 1959, for the Clutter murders, and were executed by hanging on April 14, 1965. While a polygraph test appeared to clear them of the Walker murders, at least one expert has asserted that polygraph machines of the early 1960s were notoriously inaccurate.[5]\nAccording to Sheriff's records, the Walkers had been considering buying a 1956 Chevrolet Bel Air, the same kind of stolen car that Smith and Hickock were driving through Florida. It is therefore believed that Smith and Hickock may have gained entry to the Walker home on the pretense of selling their car.[6]\n",

Moore and his wife, Harriette Moore, also an educator, were the victims of a bombing of their home in Mims, Florida, on Christmas night 1951. As the local hospital in Titusville would not treat Blacks, he died on the way to the nearest one that would, a Black hospital in Sanford, Florida, about 30 miles to the northwest. His wife died from her wounds nine days later, on January 3, 1952, at the same hospital.[1] This followed their both having been fired from teaching because of their activism.\nThe murder case was investigated, including by the FBI in 1951\u20131952, but no one was ever prosecuted. Two more investigations were conducted in the 1970s and 1990s. A state investigation and forensic work in 2005\u20132006 resulted in naming the likely perpetrators as four Ku Klux Klan members, all long dead by that time.[2] Harry T. Moore was the first NAACP member and official to be assassinated for civil rights activism; the couple are the only husband and wife to be killed for the movement.[1] Moore has been called the first martyr of this stage of the civil rights movement that expanded in the 1960s.\nIn the early 1930s, Moore had become state secretary for the Florida chapter of the NAACP. Through his registration activities, he greatly increased the number of members, and he worked on issues of housing and education. He investigated lynchings, filed lawsuits against voter registration barriers and white primaries, and worked for equal pay for black teachers in public schools.\nMoore also led the Progressive Voters League. Following a 1944 US Supreme Court ruling against white primaries, between 1944 and 1950, he succeeded in increasing the registration of black voters in Florida to 31 percent of those eligible to vote, markedly higher than in any other Southern state.\nHarry Tyson Moore was born on November 18, 1905, in Houston, Florida,[3] a tiny farming community in Suwanee County. He was the only child of Johnny and Rosa Moore. His father tended the water tanks for the Seaboard Air Line Railroad and ran a small store in front of his house. Johnny started having health issues when Harry was nine years old and died that year in 1914. His widow, Rosa, tried to manage alone, working in the cotton fields and running the small store on weekends.[citation needed]\nIn 1915, Rosa sent Harry to live with one of her sisters in Daytona Beach. The following year, he moved to Jacksonville, where he lived for the next three years with three other aunts: Jesse, Adrianna, and Masie Tyson, who shared a household. That would prove to be the most important period in his formative years. Jacksonville had a large and vibrant African-American community, with a proud tradition of independence and intellectual achievement. Moore's aunts were educated, well-informed women (two were educators and one was a nurse), who took the spindly, intelligent boy into their house on Louisiana Street and treated him like the son they had never had. Under their nurturing guidance, Moore's natural inquisitiveness and love of learning were reinforced.\nAfter three years in Jacksonville, he returned home to Suwanee County in 1919 and enrolled in the high school program of Florida Memorial College. Over the next four years, Moore excelled in his studies, and he was nicknamed \"Doc\" by his classmates. In May 1925, at age 19, he graduated from Florida Memorial College with a \"normal degree\" (for teaching in the elementary grades) and accepted a teaching job in Cocoa, Florida, in the watery wilderness of Brevard County.\nFor the next two years, Moore taught fourth grade at Cocoa's only black elementary school. During his first year in Brevard County, he met Harriette Vyda Simms, an attractive older woman (she was 23, and he was barely 20). She had taught school herself, but was then selling insurance for the Atlanta Life Insurance Company, a major black-owned business. Within a year they were married, on Christmas Day 1926.\n",

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

Martin had accompanied his father to visit his father's fianc\u00e9e at her townhouse at The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford. On the evening of February 26, Martin was walking back to the fianc\u00e9e's house from a nearby convenience store. Zimmerman, a member of the community watch, saw Martin and reported him to the Sanford Police as suspicious. Several minutes later, an altercation happened and Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the chest.\nZimmerman was injured during the altercation with Martin. He said he shot Martin in self-defense[1] and was not charged at the time. The police said there was no evidence to refute his claim of self-defense, and Florida's stand-your-ground law prohibited them from arresting or charging him. After national media focused on the incident, Zimmerman was eventually charged and tried, but a jury acquitted him of second-degree murder and manslaughter in July 2013.[2]\nFollowing Martin's death, rallies, marches, and protests were held across the United States. In March 2012, hundreds of students at his high school held a walkout in support of him. An online petition calling for a full investigation and prosecution of Zimmerman garnered 2.2 million signatures. Also in March, the media coverage surrounding Martin's death became the first story of 2012 to be featured more than the presidential race, which was underway at the time. A national debate about racial profiling and stand-your-ground laws ensued. The governor of Florida appointed a task force to examine the state's self-defense laws. Martin's life was scrutinized by the media and bloggers. The name Trayvon was tweeted more than two million times in the 30 days following the shooting.[3][4][5][6][7][8] More than 1,000 people attended the viewing of his remains the day before his funeral, which was held on March 3 in Miami. He was buried in Dade-Memorial Park (North), in Miami. A memorial was dedicated to Martin at the Goldsboro Westside Historical Museum, a Black history museum in Sanford, in July 2013.[9][10][11][12][13][14]\nMartin was born in Miami, Florida, and attended both Norland Middle School and Highland Oaks Middle School, in north Miami-Dade County, Florida. He attended Miami Carol City High School in Miami Gardens for his freshman and sophomore years. At the time of the shooting, Martin was a junior at Dr. Michael M. Krop High School in north Miami-Dade.\nMartin was born in 1995 in Miami, Florida, to Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who divorced in 1999. At the time of the shooting, Fulton was a program coordinator for the Miami Dade Housing Authority, and Tracy Martin was a truck driver; they lived near each other in Miami Gardens. Martin's older maternal half-brother, Jahavaris Fulton, was a college student at the time (who would later testify in the Zimmerman trial).[13][15][16][17][18][19]\nAfter being divorced, Martin's father married Alicia Stanley, who had two daughters from a previous marriage. They met when Martin was about three years old and were together for about 14 years. Stanley told CNN's Anderson Cooper that before she and Tracy Martin separated, Trayvon was with her 90% of the time, and that she went to all his football games and took care of him when he was sick. She said that Trayvon was a kind and loving person, not a 'thug' as the media portrayed him.[13][20][21][Note 1]\nWhen Martin was nine years old, he pulled his father, who had been immobilized by burns to the legs, out of a fire in their apartment, saving his life.[13][22] Martin enjoyed sports video games.[23] He washed cars, babysat, and cut grass to earn his own money.[13][22][23] Martin had played football at the park since he was five years old and his team was coached in part by his father. Another of Martin's former football coaches said Martin had been one of the best players on their football team (The Wolverines) that played at Forzano Park in Miramar, Florida. Martin played for the Wolverines from ages 8 to 13, and sometimes sat out because his father benched him \"because he messed up in school\".[22]  During his years in high school, Martin volunteered at Forzano Park, working in the concession stand, sometimes staying until 8 or 9 p.m., before going home. Martin's former football coach said he was a shy child and always walked with his hoodie and headphones on listening to music.[23]\nMartin's cousin Stephen Martin, who had been in a park telling jokes with Trayvon the night before his death, said that he and Trayvon had been like brothers growing up. He recalled that Trayvon had been very skilled at assembling, repairing, and riding pocket bikes and dirt bikes. Miriam Martin, Trayvon's aunt, and Stephen's mother said her nephew had often stayed over visiting her family. She also said that Trayvon was fond of wearing a hoodie: \"it could be 100 degrees outside and he always had his hoodie on.\"[22]\n",

His fix-up novel, A Canticle for Leibowitz (1959), the only novel published in his lifetime, won the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Prior to its publication, he was a writer of short stories.\nMiller was born on January 23, 1923, in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. Educated at the University of Tennessee and the University of Texas, he worked as an engineer. During World War II, he served in the Army Air Forces as a radioman and tail gunner, flying more than fifty bombing missions over Italy. He took part in the bombing of the Benedictine Abbey at Monte Cassino, which proved a traumatic experience for him. Joe Haldeman reported that Miller \"had post-traumatic stress disorder for 30 years before it had a name\", and that Miller displayed a photograph he had taken of Ron Kovic prominently in his living room.[1]\nAfter the war, Miller converted to Catholicism. He married Anna Louise Becker in 1945 and they had four children. He lived with science-fiction writer Judith Merril in 1953.\nBetween 1951 and 1957, Miller published over three dozen science fiction short stories, winning a Hugo Award in 1955 for the story \"The Darfsteller\". He also wrote scripts for the television show Captain Video in 1953.[2]\nLate in the 1950s, Miller assembled a novel from three closely related novellas he had published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction in 1955, 1956 and 1957. The novel, entitled A Canticle for Leibowitz, was published in 1959. It is a post-apocalyptic novel revolving around the canonisation of Saint Leibowitz, and is considered a masterpiece of the genre. It won the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel.\nAfter the success of A Canticle for Leibowitz, Miller ceased publishing, although several compilations of Miller's earlier stories were issued in the 1960s and 1970s. A radio adaptation of A Canticle for Leibowitz was produced by WHA Radio and NPR in 1981 and is available on CD. A radio adaptation of the first two parts was broadcast in the UK by the BBC in 1992; further details can be found on the BBC Genome Project.[3]\nIn Miller's later years, he became a recluse, avoiding contact with nearly everyone, including family members; he never allowed his literary agent, Don Congdon, to meet him. According to science fiction writer Terry Bisson, Miller struggled with depression, but had managed to nearly complete a 600-page manuscript for the sequel to Canticle before taking his own life with a firearm on January 9, 1996, shortly after his wife's death.[1][4]\nThe sequel, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, was completed by Bisson at Miller's request and published in 1997.[5]\nThe series includes Miller's two novels, published almost 40 years apart.[5]\n",

She was born in the south of Florida, and lived in the village of Royal Palm Beach at 10000 Carmen Lane until 19 years of age.[1] Her father left her when she was seven years old. As a child, Boykin lived from time to time with her mother, grandmother, aunt and other close relatives, and complained of beatings and abuse by her lover for 15 years.[2]\nHer first killing took place on November 16, 1993, when she was 18 and worked as a nanny for some family friends, killing 9-month-old Kayla Basante. For this murder, when it was later discovered, she received life imprisonment. The second murder took place on October 27, 1994, when she murdered her 5-month-old son, Daytona Boykin, for which she later received 40 years' imprisonment. She was arrested and charged a few days after Daytona's death, and then quickly confessed to murdering Basante, which until then was considered just an unlucky death. The sentences come with eligibility for parole after 25 years.[3]\nAccording to her lawyer, Alysoun B. Powell of West Palm Beach, the whole case was the result of her unhappy life, childhood confinement and parental disregard for the child's emotional needs. Powell further explained that her unfortunate childhood \"sounds like a banal excuse, but that explains why some of these crimes happen, because parents do not recognize or ignore the emotional needs of their children, and when these needs are not met, this is another example of what can happen.\"\nClover Boykin was in an unhappy marriage with Steven Boykin, with whom she married in January while she was pregnant in the 5th month, and that he threatened to take away custody of her son. Clover had an extramarital affair in that short marriage with the silent approval of her husband.[citation needed] The Boykins lived at Counterpoint Estates at Royal Palm Beach in a four-bedroom house shared with Steven's mother and her sister. At the time of the murder, Steven was at work, and her mother-in-law and sister were sleeping.\nImmediately after the arrest, the only person who corresponded with her was her friend Joe Simpson.[4] Kayla's father, Bill Basante, threatened in 1996 that \"if she ever gets out of prison, his face would be the first she sees.\" Clover Boykin complained of being severely lonely because she was serving her sentence isolated from other inmates due to the nature of her crimes, and she was granted a cellmate with a similar fate in 1995, Pauline Zile, who was later transferred to Florida's Lowell C.I. prison.[5]\nShe told the investigators that she killed her son after waking from a nightmare, in which she dreamt of her father raping her.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "Edward Dean Kennedy (May 25, 1945 \u2013 July 21, 1992) was an American murderer and prison escapee who was executed for the murders of Florida state trooper Robert McDermon and McDermon's cousin Floyd Cone.[note 1] The killings occurred just hours after Kennedy escaped from the Union Correctional Institution, where he was serving a life sentence for murder. Kennedy was sentenced to death for the murders McDermon and Cone and was executed by the electric chair.[3][4]\nOn May 19, 1978, Kennedy, along with a man named Oliver Cochran, murdered 33-year-old Robert Brown, a motel clerk, during a robbery in Miami.[5] Both were apprehended and tried, but Kennedy was able to convince the judge not to give him a death sentence by stating he wanted to do something good for society.[6] Kennedy and Cochran were ultimately sentenced to life imprisonment. Kennedy was housed at the Union Correctional Institution.[2]\nOn April 11, 1981, Kennedy, along with two other inmates, escaped from the prison. The two other escapees were quickly recaptured, while Kennedy remained at large.[7] During this time, Kennedy broke into a home where he stole multiple weapons and changed clothes. While Kennedy was in the house, the home's owner, Floyd Cone, and Cone's cousin, Robert C. McDermon, a Florida Highway Trooper, entered the home. Kennedy then shot both men to death before fleeing, running to another house on the same block. Kennedy held the second homeowners hostage while police and other authorities surrounded the area. Kennedy exclaimed he wanted television news stations covering the events as he let the occupants free. He was arrested and taken into custody not long after.[7]\nKennedy was tried on two counts of first degree murder, and was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death.[2] In 1984, Kennedy attempted to appeal his sentence, arguing his confession should not have been admissible in court, citing that the state did not prove he had knowingly been informed of his right to remain silent. Other arguments, including the excusing of a venireman, the admissibility of photographic evidence, and the propriety of certain jury instructions and of the prosecutor's closing argument, were presented. In the end, the appeal was dismissed and Kennedy's death sentence was upheld.[7]\nKennedy was scheduled to die on February 11, 1986, at 7 a.m. along with convicted killer Paul B. Johnson, who was condemned for killing a deputy sheriff. However, a high court granted a stay of execution for Kennedy.[6]\nThe decision to execute Kennedy was argued upon, and on the day of his new scheduled execution, about a half-dozen people protested outside the prison. On July 21, 1992, after the supreme court refused a stay of execution, Kennedy was executed by the electric chair. His execution was the 29th in Florida since capital punishment was reinstated in the United States.[3][4]\nOliver Cochran, the man whom assisted Kennedy in the 1978 murder that originally sent him to prison, remained imprisoned until his death on December 19, 2021.[8]\n",

        "paragraph": "\"Julie Doe\" is the nickname given to a transgender woman believed to have been murdered in Clermont, Florida, in 1988. Neither the victim's identity, nor the identity of those involved in her death, have been established. The victim was believed to be a cisgender woman until DNA testing in 2015.[3]\nThe mummified remains of the victim, aged between 22 and 35, were located at a roadside in the \"Green Swamp\" area of Clermont, Lake County, Florida on September 25, 1988. A man looking for lumber made the initial discovery. The body was dragged to a concealed area, off the roadway of County Road 474, not far from the border between Lake and Polk Counties.[4]\nShe wore a bluish-green tank top and an acid-washed denim skirt. The pantyhose she wore had been partially removed, suggesting  that sexual assault may have taken place.[5] No shoes, jewelry, or other personal items were found at the scene, including forms of identification.[6] Investigators suspect murder because of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the placement of her body.[4][2]\nBased on the condition of the body, it was estimated that she had died about two weeks to eight months before the discovery.[7][8] The remains were not in recognizable condition.[9]\nThe morning after the remains were discovered, the remains were autopsied  at the C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory in Gainesville, Florida,[2] by William R. Maples.[9] The cause of death was not apparent.\nThe victim's hair was described as long and bleached a strawberry-blond color. She had long, manicured fingernails, which may have been artificial.[7] Healed fractures were identified on her toes, one of her cheekbones, a rib, and possibly her nose.[10] She was between 5'9\" and 5'11, weighing between 150 and 180 pounds.[7] She had also undergone cosmetic surgeries. She had 250cc silicone breast implants, which would appear proportional to the victim's body.[9][2] The procedure may have been performed in Atlanta, Georgia; Miami, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York City or California.[3] It is believed the sex reassignment surgery occurred around 1984, based on the fact that the implants were discontinued around 1983.[9] She apparently had a rhinoplasty, which may have been related to the injury she sustained to her nose. It was initially thought she had given birth at least once, based on evidence of pitting on the pelvis, attributed to hormonal changes.[9][11]\nThe victim was initially believed to be a cisgender woman until a 2015 DNA test found XY chromosomes, showing that she was male at birth and had transitioned or was in the process of transitioning, based on the cosmetic surgeries she had undergone.[3][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed][11] Additionally, she was taking hormone replacement medication, which caused changes to the pelvic bones, leading to the previous assumption she had a history of pregnancy.[9]\nShortly after the remains were discovered, fingerprints were taken in hopes to identify the victim.[4] An initial sketch was created to depict an approximation of her appearance in life.[2] After the discovery that Julie Doe was a transgender woman, the sheriff's department commissioned a new forensic sketch to be created from the skull; retired Detective and forensic artist Stephen Fusco created the image.[2] This is also the time when she received her nickname.[6] Students examining the remains selected the name \"Julie\" from the LGBT-themed film To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar.[9]\nIn July 2018, isotopic tests were performed in Tampa, Florida by the University of South Florida on samples from the decedent's skull, to pinpoint potential locations where she resided.[1][6] The results suggested the victim originated from southern Florida. A sergeant working on the case voiced the possibility that the victim underwent challenges related to being a transgender woman during the 1980s.[6][1] Others have elaborated that family estrangement or disownment may have played a role in her status as unidentified.[11] As no missing individuals from this region matched her description, her disappearance was likely unreported.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nClaude Neal (b. 1911[1] \u2013 d. October 26, 1934) was a 23-year-old African-American farmhand who was arrested in Jackson County, Florida, on October 19, 1934, for allegedly raping and killing Lola Cannady, a 19-year-old white woman missing since the preceding night. Circumstantial evidence was collected against him, but nothing directly linked him to the crime. When the news got out about his arrest, white lynch mobs began to form.[2] In order to keep Neal safe, County Sheriff Flake Chambliss moved him between multiple jails, including the county jail at Brewton, Alabama, 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away. But a lynch mob of about 100 white men from Jackson County heard where he was, and brought him back to Jackson County.[3]\nThe time and place of the lynching were provided to the news media in advance and reported on nationwide, attracting a huge crowd.[4]:\u200a126\u200a The spectacle lynching had been announced to take place at the Cannady farm, but the crowd had grown unruly, and a smaller group murdered Neal in secret. He was tortured and mutilated before being hanged by the instigators at a site along the Chattahoochee River, near Greenwood, Florida. They tied his body to the back of their truck and dragged his corpse to the Cannady farm, where a white crowd estimated at 2,000 attacked the corpse by stabbing it with sticks and knives.[2] Later that night Neal's body was hanged from a tree in the courthouse square. When the sheriff discovered it in the morning, he cut it down.[3][5]\nA large group of white people went to the courthouse in Marianna, demanding that the body be hanged again so they could see it. When the sheriff refused, they began rioting, assaulting the courthouse, attacking black people in the area, injuring 200, and looting and burning houses. The body was displayed on the courthouse steps so that anyone interested could see it.[4]\nIn the next few days, white people rioted in an attempt to drive black people from the county, injuring an estimated 200 persons, including two police, and destroying black-owned property. Eventually, Governor David Sholtz called in more than 100 troops of the National Guard to suppress the white rioting.[3]\nLola Cannady (also spelled Cannidy), a 19-year-old white woman from a farming family, was missing on the evening of Thursday, October 18, 1934, after going to a water pump to water the family's hogs.[2] Friends and neighbors helped the Cannady family in their search for Lola in the fields behind the family's land. At 6:30 A.M. the next day, they found her body poorly hidden in the woods, under the cover of two logs and a pine tree branch.[2] Cannady had been bludgeoned to death with a hammer that had been taken from the Cannady field.[2] She may have been raped.[2]\nCounty Sheriff Flake Chambliss became focused on two suspects: Claude Neal, a 23-year-old black farmworker who lived about a quarter mile away, and Calvin Cross, who was white.[2] Sheriff Chambliss had received reports that Neal had been in the field near the same water pump that Lola had gone to and that he was gone for about two hours before going home.[2] Neal and Cannady had known each other since childhood; there were some suggestions that they were lovers.[2] Neal was arrested about two hours after the discovery of Cannady's body.[3]\nBecause the evidence gathered against Neal was circumstantial at best, it was not enough to prove that he was guilty of the crime.[2] The evidence included bloody clothes that were found at the home he shared with his mother, as well as a bloody piece of fabric which Sheriff Chambliss claimed fit a tear in Neal's shirt.[2] Neal reportedly had cuts on his hands and was inconsistent in his descriptions as to where they had come from; he gave three different explanations for the cuts, with one being that he had gotten them while fixing a fence, one being that he had cut his hands in a fight, and one being that he had cut them jumping a fence.[2] In addition, Neal was missing a ring on his pocket watch. A common, standard watch ring had been found near the spot where Cannady had been murdered.[2] No tests were done on the murder weapon to determine if Neal's fingerprints were on it.[2] The sheriff moved Neal's mother Mrs. Annie Smith and aunt Sallie Smith to an undisclosed jail to prevent them from being harmed by a lynch mob. The prosecution told the coroner's jury that the women said they had washed Neal's bloody clothes.[2]\nHoward Kester, a white preacher and activist, was investigating the case on behalf of the NAACP. He learned other accounts of Cannady's murder from members of the black community.[5][2] One was that she had been murdered by a white man, who later asked Neal's mother and aunt to wash his clothes and possibly offered them payment.[2] Another was that a white man from Malone, in Jackson County, had already confessed to killing Cannady, and that he had given Neal money in exchange for trading clothes with him afterward.[2] Neither of these rumors was ever proven, nor was Kester able to discover more helpful evidence.[2] Kester said that perhaps Neal and Cannady had had a secret, consensual love affair. He suggested that maybe Neal had killed her out of anger if their relationship ended. He had no evidence for this, and such an affair was denied by the Cannady family.\nBefore the coroner's jury had charged Neal and before much evidence had been found, lynch mobs began forming and searching for Neal.[2] Newspapers contributed to agitation by running stories about him as a suspect a day after the crime was discovered.[2][6] Due to lynch mobs trying to find and capture Neal, the sheriff moved him multiple times to different jails:[2] from the Bay County Jail in Panama City, to Camp Walton, then to Pensacola on the morning of October 20.[2] In Pensacola, Sheriff Herbert E. Gandy did not want to keep him in the Escambia County, Florida jail because it was not believed to be sturdy enough to withstand an attack. A lynch mob had already recently attempted to raid the jail for Neal.[2] Neal was moved briefly to Fort Barrancas at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, before finally being moved to the Escambia County, Alabama jail in Brewton, Alabama.[2] In order to keep Neal's location a secret, he was booked on charges of vagrancy under the alias of John Smith.[2]\n",

He is best known for hitting the first two home runs in Blue Jays history, in the team's first Major League Baseball (MLB) game on April 7, 1977, a 9\u20135 Toronto win against the Chicago White Sox.\nA native of Beaumont, Texas, Ault was a varsity baseball star at Texas Tech. He was drafted three times in the MLB Draft, but refused to sign. He was finally signed by the hometown Rangers in 1973 as an amateur free agent. He advanced relatively quickly though the minor League hierarchy, making the majors in 1976 as a late season replacement. With Mike Hargrove at first base, Ault became available in the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft where he was drafted by the Blue Jays. He became the starting first baseman in their first regular season game, and his actions that day turned Ault into the Blue Jays first superstar. However, he did not meet the expectations set for him, had an otherwise average career, and was out of the majors within three years.\nHe managed in the minor Leagues for several years, leading the Syracuse Chiefs to a pennant in 1985. He retired in 1994, and went to the automobile business, but a series of personal tragedies and business failures plagued him in later life.[1] Ault committed suicide on December 22, 2004.\nDoug Ault was born in Beaumont, Texas. When he was young, Ault credited his eldest sister Brenda as his main influence in baseball, for training him every day at the local baseball park and attending all his games as an amateur.[2] He was varsity baseball star at Texas Tech. He was drafted on three occasions, by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1969, the San Diego Padres in the second round in the 1970 January secondary draft, and by the Cleveland Indians in the 1970 June secondary draft, but never signed.[3] While at Texas Tech he hit .473 his senior year and was named to the 1972 College Baseball All-America Team.[4]\nHe was signed by the Rangers in 1973 as an amateur free agent.[3] He was sent to Gastonia in the Western Carolina League where he led the league in home runs with 19 in his first season playing professionally.[2] Within the next few years, Ault became a top prospect. In 1976, Ault played in 143 games for the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League leading the league in runs with 112 and total bases (278) while finishing third in home runs (25), and hits (168).[2][5] Meanwhile, he worked the off-season in an oil-platform.[4]\nAult made his Major League Baseball debut with the Texas Rangers on September 9, 1976, and in his first at-bat, he struck out against Dave Goltz of the Minnesota Twins in the second inning. Ault later singled in the fifth inning off Goltz to record his first career hit. However, the Rangers lost to the Twins 6-0. Ault finished the season appearing in nine games with the Rangers, hitting .300 with six hits in 20 at-bats.[3]\nOn November 5, the Toronto Blue Jays selected Ault with the 32nd overall pick in the 1976 MLB expansion draft.[3] He considered that day as \"grateful\" as it gave him an opportunity to play every day in the major leagues, as he was blocked at first base by All-Star Mike Hargrove while at Texas.[2] During spring training, Ault competed with veterans Nate Colbert and Ron Fairly for the starting first base position.[2]\nOn April 7, 1977, Ault was the Blue Jays' starting first baseman versus the Chicago White Sox, in the team's first professional game.[1] In bottom of the first inning, Ault, batting third in the lineup, slugged the first home run (and first hit) in Blue Jays' history[6] off White Sox starting pitcher Ken Brett. He hit another home run off Brett in the third inning, tying a major league record for most home runs in an Opening Day game. Those were the first two home runs of Ault's career (Ault also had an RBI single and a walk in the game), and the Blue Jays defeated the White Sox 9-5.  George Bell of the Blue Jays broke the record when he hit three home runs on Opening Day in 1988, and was matched by Tuffy Rhodes of the Chicago Cubs in 1994 and Dmitri Young of the Detroit Tigers in 2005. Ault was covered with \"immediate acclaim and nationwide publicity\" as a result of the feat.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJames Anthony Frederick (born June 21, 1960) is an American criminal and serial killer who was linked via DNA to three robbery-murders committed in Lantana, Florida, from 1991 to 1992. He pleaded guilty to the crimes and was sentenced to life imprisonment, but is currently serving an unrelated sentence for armed robbery in Wisconsin.\nOn December 9, 1991, the body of 40-year-old Martin J. Gatto, a New York-born filing clerk, was found at his apartment in Lantana. He had been stabbed several times with a knife, but when questioned, neighbors claimed that they had not heard any strange noises the previous night.[1] The murder shocked his co-workers, as Gatto was known as a diligent employee who got along with everybody.[2]\nOn August 22, 1992, the bodies of 45-year-old Rita Ann Bado and her 20-year-old daughter Lisa Ann, who had originally moved to Lantana from Torrington, Connecticut, were found inside an apartment in the Runaway Bay apartment complex.[3] The discovery was made by Rita's brother and his wife, who had gone to check on them after learning that Bado had failed to show up at her job as a cashier at a Walmart in Delray Beach.[4] Both women were found bound in the master bedroom; were partially nude; showed signs of sexual assault and were apparently shot to death with a small-caliber weapon.[3]\nUpon investigating the crime scene, detectives determined that most of the valuables had been left behind and that there were no apparent signs of forced entry. The only notable thing that was missing was Lisa's black Honda CR-X, but the vehicle was located a few days later outside of a warehouse in Hypoluxo.[5] Due to this, it was suggested that the killings were committed by somebody who was acquainted with the pair, but not necessarily known to them, with one of the investigators on this case mostly dismissing the suggestion that it was the work of a serial killer or somebody who was \"passing by.\"[6] To both the investigators and to Bados' friends' dismay, however, news of the double murder was quickly overshadowed by the after-effects of Hurricane Andrew, which caused great damage across the state.[7] The investigation was hampered as a result, and even with the case being featured on an episode of A Current Affair the following year, it failed to generate any leads and quickly went cold.[8]\nOver the years, the authorities investigated numerous suspects in the Bado murders, until they eventually came across Frederick in 2001.[9] A transient criminal with a rap sheet containing convictions for arson, resisting arrest and selling narcotics, he was known to live in Palm Beach at the time of the murders and was reportedly seen at the apartment on the day of the murders. Now considered a prime suspect, officers traveled to the state of Wisconsin, where Frederick was servinge a life term for armed robbery, to question him about the murders, but he did not provide them with anything useful.[9]\nEventually, authorities decided to use the advance of DNA technology for the case, uploading a sample of the supposed perpetrator's DNA found on four cigarette butts and a hair located at the Bado crime scene to CODIS. In May 2003, it was successfully matched to Frederick, who was subsequently charged with two counts of murder, burglary, kidnapping, sexual battery and grand theft.[9] Whilst he steadfastly maintainced his innocence, Frederick was nonetheless convicted and given two life terms for the Bado murders.[10]\nIn October 2006, Frederick's DNA came as a match to the Gatto murder, with which he was also charged and extradited back to Florida.[11] Although he was a known acquaintance of Gatto, Frederick denied ever knowing him or ever visiting the apartment.[12] In the end, he was never put on trial for the murder as he was already serving for life, and of September 2022, Frederick remains behind bars.\nThe Bado case was covered on an episode of the Oxygen documentary series Florida Man Murders on the episode \"Hurricane Homicides\".[13]\n",

Shortly before the shooting, Drejka approached McGlockton's car and began to confront McGlockton's girlfriend for parking in a disabled parking space without a placard. McGlockton came out of the store and shoved Drejka to the ground. At this point, Drejka drew his handgun and McGlockton began to back away. Five seconds after Drejka hit the ground, he shot McGlockton. McGlockton later died from his injuries at a local hospital. He was unarmed at the time he was shot.[1]\nDrejka, a 47-year-old man, was not initially charged for the killing by the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, with Sheriff Bob Gualtieri citing Florida's stand-your-ground law as the reason. The investigation was then handed over to the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida State Attorney Bernie McCabe, who charged Drejka with one count of manslaughter on August 13, 2018. Drejka pleaded not guilty to the charge. His trial began on August 19, 2019. Drejka was convicted of manslaughter on August 23, 2019, and was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty years on October 10, 2019.[2] The incident was widely reported by news media as another instance of Florida's controversial stand-your-ground law, six years after the killing of Trayvon Martin generated international attention and debate.[3]\nMarkeis Deon McGlockton (March 28, 1990 \u2013 July 19, 2018)[4][5] grew up in Clearwater, Florida, and formerly lived in St. Petersburg.[6] Within Pinellas County Schools, McGlockton attended middle school in St. Petersburg; and attended Boca Ciega High School but later dropped out.[6]\nIn 2009, McGlockton met Britany Jacobs through a friend while she was a student at Dunedin High School.[7] The couple had three children together during his lifetime.[6] Jacobs publicly revealed her pregnancy with their fourth child in December 2018.[8][9][10]\nMcGlockton used to work at Burger King.[6] He later worked nights as a clerk at a 7-Eleven until his death.[6] While Jacobs worked in the daytime as a certified nursing assistant,[7] McGlockton was a stay-at-home dad for their children.[6][11]\nMichael Andrew Drejka (born August 5, 1970) originally lived in Delaware. His father was a Delaware State Trooper.[12] He had a concealed carry license.[13] Drejka worked for Asplundh Tree Expert Company as a tree-trimmer and often performed cleanup work.[14] He quit the tree-trimming business in 2007 and lived with his girlfriend Cara Lynne Brooks.[15] In 2010, Drejka moved to Pinellas County, where he got married.[12] He later worked as an Uber driver until problems with his vehicle forced him to quit.[15][16]\nOn the afternoon of July 19, 2018, McGlockton picked up Jacobs from her employer with their three children in the vehicle, reportedly a 2016 Chrysler\u00a0200.[7][17] Jacobs took over the wheel and drove the family to the Circle A Food Store so McGlockton could buy snacks for the children.[7] Jacobs illegally parked the vehicle in the store's only handicapped parking space,[clarification needed] located on the side of the building.[7][failed verification] McGlockton went into the store with their five-year-old son, Markeis\u00a0Jr.[17]\nWhile Jacobs was sitting inside the vehicle, Drejka pulled up in his Toyota 4-Runner, also parking illegally, [18] after having come from the WaWa on Missouri Ave in Largo.[17][19][failed verification] Drejka got out of his SUV and searched for a disabled parking placard on Jacobs' vehicle.[20] Video surveillance shows Drejka starting a confrontation with Jacobs over the parking space.[21] She had the other two children, aged three years and four months, seated in the car at the time.[21] McGlockton had not yet finished checking out when he overheard the store clerk being informed of the situation.[22]\nAround 3:30 pm, video surveillance shows McGlockton walked out of the store and walked up to Drejka and shoved him to the ground and kept walking towards him.[17] Three seconds later, Drejka pulled out a .40-caliber Glock, which he steadied with both hands. McGlockton immediately backed up when confronted with the firearm. As McGlockton backed up to his vehicle he began to turn towards the front of the store and away from Drejka. Drejka then fired a single shot striking McGlockton in the chest.[22][23] After being shot, McGlockton ran back into the store and collapsed in front of his son.[17][24] Paramedics arrived 19 minutes later and rushed McGlockton to Morton Plant Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 4:04 pm.[17]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn November 23, 2012, Jordan Davis, a black 17-year-old high school student, was murdered at a Gate Petroleum gas station in Jacksonville, Florida, by Michael David Dunn, a white 45-year-old software developer, following an argument over loud music played by Davis and his three friends, in what was believed to be a racially motivated shooting.\nDunn was convicted on three counts of attempted second-degree murder for firing at three other teenagers who were with Davis and one count of firing into an occupied vehicle. The jury could not reach a verdict about whether to convict Dunn for the murder of Davis at the first trial. In a second trial, Dunn was found guilty of the first-degree murder of Davis and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole plus 105 years in prison, which is two de facto consecutive life sentences.[4][5]\nIn 2021, the jury and judges on the Florida Supreme Court rejected Dunn's appeal based on the stand-your-ground law in Florida.\nDunn and his fianc\u00e9e Rhonda Rouer traveled from their home in Brevard County to attend Dunn's son's wedding in Orange Park, near Jacksonville, Florida. Dunn and Rouer left the wedding early in order to return to their hotel and take care of their six-month-old puppy. On the way back to their hotel, the two decided to stop at the Gate Petroleum gas station to purchase a bottle of wine.[6]\nTommie Stornes, Leland Brunson, Jordan Davis, and Tevin Thompson had been spending the day traveling to various malls when they decided to go to the Gate Petroleum gas station in order to buy gum and cigarettes.[7]\nThe shooting of Jordan Davis took place in Jacksonville in Duval County. Around 7:30\u00a0p.m., four teenage boys (Leland Brunson, Jordan Davis, Tommie Stornes, and Tevin Thompson) stopped at a Gate Petroleum gas station. Stornes left his red Dodge Durango SUV running while he went into the store. Brunson, Davis, and Thompson remained in the vehicle listening to music which was described as \"very loud.\" Dunn, driving a black Volkswagen Jetta sedan, and his fianc\u00e9e Rhonda Rouer pulled into the right adjacent parking spot.[8] Rouer left their car to purchase white wine and chips.[9] She testified that Dunn told her \"I hate that thug music,\" before she left the car for the store, though Dunn claims he used the phrase \"rap crap.\"[10][11]\nThe bass from the loud music playing in the teens' SUV annoyed Dunn, who asked for it to be turned down.[9][12] The front seat passenger, Tevin Thompson, initially complied and turned the volume down, but Jordan Davis requested the volume be turned back up.[13][14]\nDavis' protests continued and an independent witness overheard Dunn say \"No, you're not gonna talk to me that way.\" Dunn, who had a concealed weapons permit,[8] took a handgun out of his glove compartment and started firing at Davis' door, hitting him in the legs, lungs, and aorta. As the SUV backed up to evade his gunshots, Dunn opened his own door and continued firing at the car in shooter's stance, as the boys ducked for cover. Dunn later testified that he still feared for his safety as well as that of Rouer who was to return to the vehicle imminently.[15]\n",

[1] The murder would be adapted into the 2001 film Bully.\nBobby Kent, the son of Iranian immigrants Fred and Farah Kent (originally surnamed Khayam),[2] attended South Broward High School in the South Florida suburb of Hollywood, Florida.[3] According to Tim Donnelly, who prosecuted all the conspirators for this murder, one attorney described Kent as \"like Eddie Haskell. All the parents loved him in the neighborhood, but the kids looked at him a different way.\"[4]\nMarty Puccio is an Italian-American, and was raised Catholic.[5] Kent and Puccio had known each other since third grade, had lived on the same block in Hollywood, Florida since that time, and were good friends as teenagers. Bad blood, however, existed between the two. Puccio felt \"ill-will and hatred\" towards Kent, who would bully and pummel him.[6]\nBoth sets of parents were wary of the friendship as well. Puccio's parents, Martin Sr. and Veronica, were concerned because Marty often returned from being with Kent bleeding or covered in bruises. Fred Kent thought of Puccio as a wayward slacker who had no future (Puccio was a high school dropout) and felt the friendship with his son would destroy the future he was helping him build. Frequent gym-goers, both boys were rumored to use steroids, which, in Kent's case, according to testimonial accounts, significantly contributed to his erratic, aggressive behavior.[citation needed]\nKent and Puccio had experimented with making gay porn movies, hoping to distribute them to local shops. Neither Kent nor Puccio actually participated in these movies, but, rather, allegedly directed them and coaxed a Florida man in his 40s to perform on camera. Kent tried to peddle a movie, titled Rough Boys, to porn shops across South Florida. None took him up on the offer, due to the poor audio and video quality as well as the lack of any sexual activities in the film beyond the man dancing nude and playing with a dildo.[7]\nToward the beginning of 1993, Puccio (aged 20) began dating Lisa Connelly (aged 18). Frustrated by how much time Puccio spent with Kent (aged 20) as well as Kent's treatment of Puccio, Connelly tried to distract Kent from Puccio by setting up her friend Alice \"Ali\" Willis (aged 17) with Kent.[8] Kent and Willis dated for a few weeks, but she ultimately ended the relationship because he was abusive.[9] In June, Puccio confided to Connelly that Kent had been abusive to him quite often over the years. Connelly tried to convince him to end the friendship, but Puccio seemed hesitant. By this time, Connelly knew she was pregnant with Puccio's child, and was determined to pursue a permanent relationship with him.[10]\nAllegedly, Connelly decided that Kent needed to be eliminated permanently, and began talking to Puccio and other friends about murdering him.[11] On July 13, 1993, Connelly called Willis and told her that \"Bobby Kent was planning to come to Palm Bay, Florida, where Willis was living, to murder her and smother her baby [by a previous relationship], unless she returned to Broward County to date him again.\"[12] Willis claimed Connelly asked her to come to Connelly's house to discuss murdering Bobby Kent. Willis went to Connelly's house and brought two friends, her current boyfriend, Donald Semenec (aged 17), and Heather Swallers (aged 18).[13]\nOn the night of July 13, 1993, Puccio, Semenec, Swallers, Connelly and Willis met with Kent. Puccio, Semenec, and Swallers became uncomfortable and left. Connelly and Willis lured Kent to a new development under construction with the promise that he would be able to drive Willis' Mustang 5.0 and have sex with her.[14] Connelly had brought along her mother's pistol, intending to kill Kent while he was distracted by sexual activity with Willis, but was unable to go through with shooting him.[15]\nDespite the failed attempt, Connelly still wanted Kent dead. Seeking assistance, she contacted a self-proclaimed hitman named Derek Kaufman (aged 20), who had been recommended by a friend of Willis'. The group met Kaufman at his home in Rolling Oaks, Florida.[16] They wanted him to get a gun so they could kill Kent that night, but Kaufman told them he couldn't procure a weapon that quickly. Willis, Connelly, Semenec and Swallers then went back to Connelly's house and were joined by her cousin, Derek Dzvirko (aged 19).[17] The group continued to discuss their plans, and ultimately decided to go ahead with murdering Kent the next night, with Kaufman's assistance.[18]\n",

Convicted of all three murders and receiving deaths sentences in all three states, Justus was executed in Virginia in 1990.[1]\nJustus was born in Niagara Falls, New York on Christmas Day, 1952. He came from an abusive family, and eventually ended up in a Virginia orphanage.[2]\nOn October 3, 1978, Justus broke into the Ironto, Virginia trailer of Ida Mae Moses, 21, and proceeded to rape and murder her. Moses, a nurse, had been set to give birth in two weeks and had already planned a name for her unborn son.\nJustus moved south, picking up an 18-year-old hitchhiker, Dale Goins, along the way. They kidnapped, raped, and murdered Rosemary Jackson, a 32-year-old housewife, while she was leaving a store in Atlanta. Days later, in Florida, Justus and Goins kidnapped, raped, and murdered, Stephanie Hawkins, who had been preparing for her son's birthday party.\nJustus was arrested on October 11, 1978, in Grundy, Virginia. He and Goins were tried for each of the three murders they had committed. Justus was convicted of killing Moses, Jackson, and Hawkins, receiving a death sentence for each murder.[3][4] Goins was convicted of murdering Jackson and Hawkins, receiving life sentences in Georgia and Florida, which he is still serving.[5] In 1983, Justus said he was planning to waive his appeals, but then changed his mind.[6]\nAfter his appeals failed, Justus was executed in the electric chair at the Virginia State Penitentiary on December 13, 1990. Justus had no last words, but gave an interview earlier that day. In a morning interview with WFIR, Justus said \"I want it to be over with, not for me, but for the victims' families. I'm ready to go to a better place. I want it to be put to rest. I've asked for forgiveness to a lot of people and I was able to forgive myself.\" Justus also admonished capital punishment, calling it \"barbaric\". \"Let me be the last person,\" he said. \"There is a better way to deal with crimes than taking people's lives.\"[7] His last meal consisted of sirloin steak, french fries, tossed salad, strawberry pie and tea. Justus was the last man executed at the Virginia State Penitentiary. All subsequent executions in Virginia were carried out at Greensville Correctional Center.\n",

In 2016, Patrick and Tammy conspired to kill Tammy's children, one of whom was Patrick's daughter, then each other. However, following the murders, and after Tammy was voluntarily killed by Patrick, he found himself unable to follow through. Carlopoli instead called the police and was arrested. He later pleaded guilty and was sentenced to forty years in prison.\nCarlopoli was from Las Vegas while Tammy, who was born Tammy Jo Lewis, was from Indianapolis. Tammy married a man named Mark Modlin, and they had a daughter together in 1999, who they named Montana. The two got divorced in the early 2000s.[1]\nTammy graduated from Castle High School in 1990, and the University of Southern Indiana in 1996, with a degree in political science.[2]\nCarlopoli moved to Florida after having a falling-out with his family. He met Tammy, who was on disability checks while staying in a hotel at Orlando in 2010, and the two started dating. Carlopoli, who was attending college, started personally tutoring Montana Modlin in math.[3] The couple moved to Fort Myers after Carlopoli got a school transfer. Carlopoli got a job as a waiter at an Outback Steakhouse restaurant to help pay for tuition. He had hoped to become a mechanical engineer.[4]\nNeither Carlopoli nor Tammy had histories of violence. Carlopoli had no criminal record and Tammy only had a 2015 citation for failing to pay a toll.[4]\nIn 2012, Carlopoli and Tammy had a daughter together, who they named Jeanne Carlopoli.[5] The couple could sometimes be heard fighting, occasionally loudly and viciously. Two neighbors said they heard the Carlopoli and Modlin yelling at cursing at each other regularly. Although they sometimes saw the family on several occasions, including once at a cookout, they noted that even then, they didn't seem happy. The family had also lived in relative isolation.[6][7]\nOne neighbor told reporters that they regretted not saying anything sooner. They said they often saw Jeanne staring out the window. \"She looked like there was something wrong,\" she said. \"She was always in the same pajamas, her hair was never combed. Looked dirty.\" She went on to say that she and other neighbors talked about calling someone to check on the family, but never did. Maybe if we had, she would still be alive,\" said the neighbor.[8]\nAccording to Carlopoli, Tammy experienced paranoid delusions prior to the murders. Six days beforehand, Carlopoli was fired, and his friends reported he began acting different.[9] Two days beforehand, Tammy posted a message on Facebook saying \"I have suffered from depression my whole life. I have taken a Sam's bottle of Tylenol. Please wait for notification. I will refuse a hospital. It is my time. I love you. It is for the best. I want peace.\"[10]\nCarlopoli and Tammy conspired to kill the children, their dog, and themselves. On January 24, 2016, Carlopoli and Tammy fatally stabbed Milo, the family's Chihuahua-Jack Russell. Tammy then stabbed Jeanne, 3, and shot Montana, 16. She was then voluntarily shot and killed by Carlopoli. However, when Carlopoli was unable to muster the willpower to kill himself. He instead dropped the gun, went outside, and called the police.[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "Harmon Murray (1868 or 1869 \u2013 1891) was an African-American who briefly achieved notoriety in 1890 and 1891 as the reputed leader of a feared criminal gang in northern Florida, and for killing a number of men, including a sheriff and a deputy sheriff, before being killed himself by an acquaintance.\nHarmon Murray was born in Long Pond, a community in northern Marion County, Florida, in 1868[1] or 1869.[2] His parents, Gilbert Murray and Emily James, had been brought to Alachua County from South Carolina in the 1850s as slaves. They were married in 1860. Harmon was their fifth child. He was named after Henry S. Harmon, an African American lawyer and politician in Gainesville.[3]\nEmily James' parents were respected citizens in Gainesville, and when Murray was six years old, he went to live with his grandparents so that he could attend the Union Academy there, a school established in 1866 by the Freedmen's Bureau to educate freed slaves.[4] While there, he exhibited behavior that suggests juvenile delinquency. When he was about twelve years old, he left home and reportedly went to Georgia to stay with relatives until 1888, when he was nineteen or twenty years old. It was rumored that he had killed someone near the Satilla River in southeastern Georgia while he lived there.[5][6]\nAt the time of Murray's birth, African Americans held political power in Alachua County. They had made up the majority of the population in the county before the Civil War, and immediately after the war cotton farmers, who anticipated a large crop, had recruited African-American workers from Georgia and South Carolina to move to the county and help with the harvest. Reconstruction had initially disenfranchised whites who had supported the Confederacy, and enfranchised African Americans, and thus given them and white Republicans the opportunity to fill political offices. The political position of African Americans in Florida deteriorated after the end of Reconstruction in 1877, and by the time Murray returned to the county in 1888, conservative whites were consolidating their control of state and local politics, and beginning to enact laws intended to suppress and control the African American population.[7][8]\nShortly after returning to Florida, Murray worked on the dairy farm of Hyman Pinkoson, on the west side of Gainesville near Lake Alice. In September 1888, Murray took his employer's horse to ride to Arredondo, a community southwest of Gainesville, to visit his girlfriend. When Pinkoson found both his horse and Murray gone in the morning, he set out to find them, telling people he met that he suspected Murray had stolen his horse. As Murray was passing through Millard's Station (on the Florida Central and Peninsular Railway between Gainesville and Arredondo) on the way to Gainesville the next morning, a storekeeper named Thomas McPherson recognized him. McPherson called on Murray to stop, but Murray ran and McPherson shot and wounded him. Murray was placed in the county jail.[9][10]\nOn September 16, 1888, shortly after Murray was jailed, yellow fever struck Gainesville. A quarantine was imposed, but most of the town's 2,500 residents fled.[11] The fall session of the circuit court was not held in Gainesville that year, and Murray remained in jail until he was brought to trial in May 1889, with circuit judge Jesse J. Finley presiding. Found guilty, Murray was sentenced to two years hard labor in the state penitentiary. As was common at the time, he was hired out to work in a turpentine camp near Tampa.[12][10]\nWhile imprisoned at the turpentine camp, Murray became friendly with Michael Kelly (a white man), Tony Champion, and Alex Henderson, the last two of whom had family ties to Alachua County. Henderson was released in November 1889. Champion escaped from the prison camp in March, 1890. Murray escaped from the camp in June 1890, and soon reunited with Champion in Tampa. Murray and Champion eventually began committing burglaries in Tampa. On learning that the police were looking for them, they left for Alachua County, reaching Gainesville in October. There they found Alex Henderson, who introduced them to his brother Isaac and other members of a gang. Murray and Champion joined the gang. The gang was soon robbing businesses during the day. As the gang carried rifles during the robberies, they became known as the \"Winchester rifle brigade\". In January 1891 the gang robbed a store, attacking the owner and almost killing him. There was a public uproar, and the sheriff hired L. T. Timmons, a black private detective, to gather information on the gang.[13][14]\nMichael Kelly was released from the turpentine camp early in November 1890. By the end of the year, Kelly was in Gainesville and early the next year was connected with the Henderson gang.[15][a] Beginning around this time, there were a number of burglaries committed throughout Alachua County. Every business in Micanopy was burglarized on the night of January 17. Businesses in Gainesville, Evinston, and Arredondo were also burglarized that month. On the night of February 3, a gang was seen breaking into a store in Waldo, but an armed neighbor chased them off before they could take anything. Later in the week, a gun shop owned by W. H. Bracy in Gainesville was broken into and looted. The burglars set fire to the store, but exploding cartridges woke Bracy, who lived next door, and he was able to put the fire out. Bracy, unsure of the ability of local law enforcement to catch the burglars, also hired the private detective Timmons to find them. One night in the middle of February, a gang threw a brick through a plate glass window of a general merchandise business in Gainesville. A black policeman patrolling the city heard the noise and ran toward the store. The gang fired a couple of shots at the policeman and fled. They shot at a man who spoke to them as they ran by and fired a shotgun and a pistol at a doctor who had stepped out of his house to see what the noise was about. The citizens of the city were upset about the recent events, but little was known about the perpetrators. One witness said that the gang was all black, another witness said it was all white.[16]\nL. T. Timmons, the black private detective hired by the sheriff and by Bracy, the gun shop owner, was able to track down Alex Henderson, Murray's former prison camp-mate, on the day after the shootings in Gainesville. Henderson, unhappy about the close call of the previous night, as well as the rapid pace of the gang's burglaries, agreed to give Timmons information about the gang in exchange for ten dollars. Henderson told Timmons that the gang planned that night to attack the general store in Millard's Station belonging to Thomas McPherson, the man who had shot Murray two-and-a-half years before. Timmons then took Henderson to Bracy, who agreed to pay a reward to Henderson if he could lead the rest of the gang into a trap. The sheriff was brought into the plan. Henderson was to bring the other gang members back to a hideout, where the sheriff and a posse would be waiting in hiding. However, the gang did not return directly to the hideout, but went to McPherson's store first. When the gang tried to break into his store, McPherson woke up and armed himself. The would-be burglars retreated, and set McPherson's barn on fire. McPherson was shot while watching his barn burn, and died later in the night. In the confusion after McPherson was shot, Kelly and Champion reportedly were hit by gunfire, but escaped with Murray and returned to Gainesville.[17][18]\n",

Four men broke into the home and bludgeoned six victims to death. The four attackers,[2] apparently inspired by the film Wonderland,[3] tortured and killed four men, two women, and a dog inside the home, making it the bloodiest mass murder in Volusia County history.[4] Their primary motive for the murders was revenge on Erin Belanger, who had evicted a squatter, Troy Victorino, from her grandmother's then-vacant house, with the secondary motive of recovering an Xbox game console and some clothing that Victorino had left behind. Victorino was able to further motivate his accomplices by pointing out that the attack would likely allow them to kill another person they were mad at, but that person happened not to be at the house that night.[5]\nA jury found Troy Victorino, Robert Cannon, Jerone Hunter, and Michael Salas guilty of the massacre in August 2006. Seventh Circuit Judge William A. Parsons upheld the jury's death penalty recommendation and called the killings \"conscienceless\" and \"unnecessarily torturous.\"[6] He told each of the men during back-to-back sentencing hearings, \"You have not only forfeited your right to live among us, you have forfeited your right to live at all.\" Salas and Cannon were both sentenced to life in prison, while Hunter and Victorino received the death sentence. The death sentences of Victorino and Hunter were overturned on June 14, 2017.[7] Prosecutors intend to seek death sentences for the two men again and both Victorino and Hunter are awaiting resentencing.[8][9][10]\nVictorino and Hunter were among a group squatting on Belanger's grandparents' property while they were away.[11] The group was using the property as a party house. Belanger, who had moved to Florida to look after her grandparents' home, had deputies evict the squatters and boxed up belongings left behind.[11]\nVictorino reasoned that Belanger and her housemates had \"robbed\" him of his Xbox and other belongings. Victorino told witnesses that, in the days before the killings, Belanger showed disrespect for him by calling police when he tried to get his belongings.[12] \"He claims he is a Latin King, he is this big gang leader and they basically disrespected him and he had to deal with that because they couldn't treat a King like that,\" said the witness.[12]\nOne week before the murders, Victorino fired a gun in a car near the home on Telford Lane. That gun was supposed to be used for the murders, but the suspects couldn't find enough ammunition, so they rounded up about 15 baseball bats from neighborhood children instead.[11]\nTwo days before the massacre, a clerk at the New Smyrna Beach Wal-Mart witnessed Victorino and his co-conspirators \"laughing and giggling and being rowdy\" at the store. The clerk told Volusia sheriff's investigators that she had a feeling the men \"were up to no good\" after spotting them in the store with baseball bats in hand.[11]\nShe said Cannon told the others, \"We could take this bat and swing it and knock 'em over the head and crush their skull in.\" Salas then jumped in, the clerk told investigators, and said: \"I got a better idea. . . . We could bash 'em in the face and knock their teeth down their throat.\"[11]\nVictorino had been arrested July 29, 2004 for assaulting another man, but posted bail the next day. Richard Burrow, Victorino's probation officer, was notified of the arrest and was required to file a report to a judge detailing the arrest within 48 hours. This report could have sent Victorino back to jail on a probation violation. Paul Hayes, Burrow's supervisor, did not receive the report until August 4, and a judge did not receive it until August 6, after the massacre. In addition, Victorino met with Burrow on August 5. At this point, Burrow had the legal authority to conduct a \"warrant-less\" arrest on Victorino, and according to department officials should have done so. Instead, Victorino remained free. As a result, Hayes and Burrow were fired on August 9, along with two top administrators.[11][13]\nJonathan Gleason was on the recliner when the men stormed the house, and was fatally stabbed in the neck by Hunter. Victorino beat Francisco \"Flaco\" Ayo-Roman with an aluminum bat. Tito Gonzalez was murdered by Hunter, who fatally beat him in the head with a bat and stabbed him multiple times in the chest and stomach.[14]\n",

        "paragraph": "Francisco del Junco (born August 3, 1957) is a Cuban-American serial killer who killed and subsequently burned the corpses of four Miami prostitutes during a period of around eight months.[1] Del Junco was convicted of all 4 murders, and given a life sentence for each of them.[2]\nDel Junco, originally from Cuba, was born as the first child into a family with a history of mental illness.[2] His childhood was described as \"very tragic\", with Francisco being rejected by his peers, coupled with having to take medication for epilepsy since he was 3 years old. Although his father ignored him, Francisco's happiest memories involved going to the beach with his mother.[1]\nAt age 16, Del Junco began hearing voices and started seeing priestesses conducting black magic, gradually distancing himself from people as he feared somebody was out to kill him. In 1980, he moved to Miami to settle in with some relatives, arriving through the Mariel boatlift. During his time in the States, Del Junco worked several jobs, regularly visited his psychiatrist and was admitted to the Miami Mental Health Clinic a total of three times (in 1987, 1988 and 1992).[1]\nFrom 1987 to 1995, he was arrested on several occasions for assaulting an officer, burglary, loitering and theft. Del Junco also did not visit his psychiatrist for a final appointment, but was still given a \"guarded\" prognosis and was judged as not being a threat to society.[1]\nHowever, from August 1995 to March 1996, a total of four crack cocaine-addicted black prostitutes were beaten up, killed with metal pipes and their bodies burned with gasoline afterwards in Miami's Allapattah neighborhood.[3] They were: Vida Hicks (43), Diane Nelms (44), Cheryl Ray (37) and Janice Cox (37).[1] All of them were lured with the promise of free drugs and sex, with their upper torsos being lit on fire after they were killed.[4]\nFollowing a 10-month investigation by a special task force, Del Junco was arrested, with a container of gasoline and wooden matches in hand, after the authorities were given substantial information by a homeless woman who was beaten up by Francisco, after she had refused to go on a date with him.[3] Forensic tests were carried out, with results matching the size pattern of the accused's combat boots' prints, found on the crime scene. Del Junco himself later confessed to the crimes,[3] explaining in detail how he took his victims to Key Biscayne, away from industrial surroundings, where he would kill them. He described details only the killer could know, thus exonerating a previous suspect only known under the nickname 'Dread'.[5]\nAt his trial, the Miami-Dade County judge ruled that Francisco del Junco was ineligible for the death penalty due to his mental illness, and was instead given four concurrent life sentences.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nAdam John Walsh (November 14, 1974 \u2013 July 27, 1981) was an American child who was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall in Hollywood, Florida, on July 27, 1981. His severed head was found two weeks later in a drainage canal alongside Highway 60\u00a0/ Yeehaw Junction in rural Indian River County, Florida. His death garnered national interest and was made into the 1983 television film Adam, seen by 38 million people in its original airing.[3]\nAdam's father, John Walsh, became an advocate for victims of violent crimes and was the host of the television program America's Most Wanted and, later, In Pursuit with John Walsh.[4] Convicted serial killer Ottis Toole confessed to Adam's murder, but was never convicted of the crime because evidence was reportedly lost and Toole later recanted his confession. Toole died in prison of liver failure on September 15, 1996.[5] No new evidence has come to light since then, and police announced on December 16, 2008, that the Walsh case was closed and that they were satisfied that Toole was the killer.\nOn the afternoon of July 27, 1981, Adam accompanied his mother Rev\u00e9 on a shopping trip to the Hollywood Mall (today Hollywood Hills Plaza) in Hollywood, Florida (26\u00b000\u203246\u2033N 80\u00b010\u203230\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff26.012847\u00b0N 80.175005\u00b0W\ufeff / 26.012847; -80.175005). They went to Sears, entering through the north entrance.[6][7] Rev\u00e9 intended to inquire about a lamp that was on sale[8] and left Adam at a kiosk with Atari 2600 video games on display, where several other boys were taking turns playing them.[9] Rev\u00e9 completed her business in the lamp department around 12:15\u00a0p.m.[6][10] She said that she returned to find that Adam and the other boys had disappeared. A store manager informed her that a scuffle had broken out over whose turn it was at the kiosk, and a security guard demanded that the boys leave the store.[11] The security guard asked the older boys if their parents were present, and they said that they were not.[12] Adam's parents later conjectured that their son had been too shy to speak to the security guard, who presumed that he was in the company of the other boys and made him leave by the same door by which the boys had entered (the Sears west entrance). His parents believe that after the other boys dispersed, he was left alone outside the store at an exit unfamiliar to him.[13][12][14] Meanwhile, unable to find Adam in the toy department, Rev\u00e9 had him paged over the public-address system and continued to look for him throughout the store.[15] By coincidence, she ran into her mother-in-law Jean, who helped her search for him.[16] After more than 90 minutes of searching and paging failed to locate Adam, Rev\u00e9 called the Hollywood Police at 1:55\u00a0p.m.[6]\nOn August 10, a severed head was found in a drainage canal alongside the Florida Turnpike near Vero Beach, almost 130 miles (210 kilometers) from Hollywood, by detective Ralph E. Latimer Jr. and an unidentified deputy of the Indian River County sheriff's office.[17][18] Indian River County and St. Lucie County divers searched the canal.[17] On the morning of August 11, John and Rev\u00e9 appeared on national television saying that they still hoped that Adam was alive. A US$100,000 (equivalent to $298,060 in 2021) reward was posted for Adam's safe return.[19] Soon after, the recovered remains were identified as Adam's.[20]\nThe coroner ruled that the cause of Adam's death was asphyxiation. The state of the remains suggested that Adam had died several days before the discovery of his head. The rest of his body was never recovered.[5] The head, itself, would be kept in the morgue until the case's closure in 2008.[21]\nJohn and Rev\u00e9 knew that the Hollywood police department had botched the treatment of Adam's disappearance, first with the missing-person investigation, and then with the murder investigation.[22]\nAfter some investigation, police eventually concluded that Adam was abducted by a drifter named Ottis Toole near the front exterior of Sears after being instructed to leave by a security guard. Toole said that he had lured Adam into his white 1971 Cadillac (which had a damaged right bumper) with promises of toys and candy, then proceeded to drive north on Interstate 95 toward his home in Jacksonville. According to Toole, Adam, at first docile and compliant, began to panic as they drove on. Toole punched him in the face, but as this just made the situation worse, he then \"walloped him unconscious.\" While Adam was unconscious, Toole drove north on the Florida Turnpike to a deserted service road just north of the Radebaugh Road overpass in northwest St. Lucie County (27\u00b032\u203207\u2033N 80\u00b036\u203235\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff27.535352\u00b0N 80.609690\u00b0W\ufeff / 27.535352; -80.609690).[23] When Toole realized that Adam was still breathing, he strangled him to death with a seat belt, dragged him out of the car and decapitated him with a machete. Toole also claimed to have incinerated the body in an old refrigerator when he returned to Jacksonville. He claimed that he wanted to make Adam his adopted son, but that was not deemed feasible. The source of the blood found in Toole's car could not be identified.[5] The police ultimately lost the bloodstained carpet from the car, the machete said to have been used to decapitate Adam and, eventually, the car itself. Toole, a confidant of convicted serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, repeatedly confessed and then retracted accounts of his involvement.[citation needed]\nToole was never charged in Adam's case, although he provided seemingly accurate descriptions as to how he committed the crime. The 2019 Netflix miniseries The Confession Killer shows footage of him apparently being fed information from interrogators and he later confessed to several cases he had no involvement in.[24]  Several witnesses also placed him in the Hollywood area in the days leading up to Adam's disappearance.[5] In September 1996, he died in prison of cirrhosis at the age of 49 while serving a life sentence for other crimes.[12] Later, his niece told John Walsh that he made a deathbed confession to Adam's murder.[12][25] His confession was viewed as unreliable, as he and Lucas confessed to or implicated themselves in more than 200 homicides.[26] Most of Lucas' confessions were later revealed to have been false, having been coerced by the Texas Rangers.[27]\n",

He stabbed their 8-year-old son Ronnie Oneal IV, who survived and told detectives \"My father shot my mother\" before being escorted to a local hospital.[1]\nOneal was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of aggravated child abuse, one count of arson, and one count of resisting a law enforcement officer.  On July 23, 2021, he was given three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, plus 90 years.\nAt 11:43\u00a0p.m. EDT, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office received a 911 emergency call from an unknown woman, now believed to have been Kenyatta. An unknown male voice can be heard screaming \"Allah Akbar\" (which means \"God is the greatest\"). Then the female caller said, \"I\u2019m so sorry Ronnie,\" as she screamed loudly. A male caller could be heard in the background saying, \"She killed me,\" and, \"Don\u2019t come outside, call 911 now,\" according to the news release.

Ronnie IV escaped the home with stab wounds and burns and told a detective, \"My father shot my mother,\" before being promptly transported to a hospital for treatment.\nRonnie III resisted arrest until being tasered by police. While inside the squad car, he called his murdered victim Kenyatta \"the devil\" and said, \"the kids are the devil's kids.\" He was booked into Hillsborough County Jail the next day.[1]\nOn March 22, four days after the attack, Ronnie IV told detectives his account of the events of March 18 that left his mother and sister dead.[2]\n",

Seven people, including the shooter, were killed in the incident. The shooter was identified by police as 42-year-old Pedro Alberto Vargas, a resident of Hialeah, who, after setting his apartment ablaze, opened fire from his balcony and inside the apartment, then held two people hostage before being fatally shot by a SWAT team in the early hours of July 27.\nAt 1:37\u00a0p.m., hours before the shooting started, Vargas called 9-1-1 and reported he was being followed, asking the dispatcher to run the license plate of a vehicle parked outside his apartment. He also claimed he was being threatened by people using witchcraft on him. His mother, 83-year-old Esperanza Patterson, then took the phone and told the dispatcher about her son's strange behavior. The dispatcher informed Patterson that police units have been sent to her residence, but Patterson advised against it, and later informed the dispatcher that Vargas had left, having gone to the office of a lawyer he hired for a recent legal matter.[3]\nAccording to officials, Vargas poured combustible liquid on $10,000 in cash and set it on fire in his apartment unit at around 6:30\u00a0p.m.[4][5][6] The Todel Apartments' manager, 79-year-old Italo Pisciotti, and his 69-year-old wife Samira noticed the smoke and ran to the apartment. Vargas stepped into the hallway and opened fire with a Glock 17 9mm semiautomatic pistol, killing both.[1][7][8][9] He proceeded to go to his balcony on the fourth floor of the building and fired 10 to 20 bullets into the street, fatally hitting 33-year-old Carlos Gavilanes as he got out of his car.[7][8][9]\nVargas then kicked open the door of apartment 304, where he shot and killed the residents, 64-year-old Patricio Simono, his 51-year-old wife Merly Niebels, and their 17-year-old daughter Priscilla Perez.[8][9][10][11] Police officers responded to the scene and exchanged gunfire with Vargas throughout the complex's stairwells for about five hours.[12][13]\nVargas then entered apartment 525, where he took the residents, Zoeb and Farida Nek, hostage for about three hours. During the standoff, he continued firing shots at officers outside. After negotiations reportedly broke down, authorities decided to send in a six-officer SWAT team to rescue the hostages. The team entered the building and found the two hostages praying in the living room, while Vargas was pacing around out of their view. Officers outside distracted Vargas with a stun grenade, allowing the SWAT team to rescue the hostages and open fire on Vargas, who they gunned down after a brief shootout. Both hostages escaped unharmed. Two fully loaded magazines were found at the scene.[13][6][8][9][12][14]\nThe event was the deadliest mass shooting in Hialeah's history,[15] as well as the deadliest in the entire Miami area in three decades.[16]\nPedro Alberto Vargas (October 3, 1970[14] \u2013 July 27, 2013), a Cuban native, was identified as the shooter. He was born in Havana to teacher parents. His father died in 1991 or 1992. Vargas studied at the University of Pedagogical Sciences between 1990 and 1994, graduating with a bachelor's degree in technical education.[14]\nHe and his mother, Esperanza Patterson, immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-1990s after winning U.S. visa lotteries,[14] and Vargas was naturalized in 2004. According to records, he resided in apartment 408 with Patterson since 1999[3][13][14] and had committed no serious criminal offenses.[17][18] He took classes at Miami Dade College, graduating in 2004 with an associate degree in graphic design.[14]\n",

Terry Lee King, a resident of Cantonment, Florida, U.S., was bludgeoned to death by his two children, 13-year old Derek and 12-year old Alex King.\nOn November 26, 2001, Derek, accompanied by Alex, beat their father to death with an aluminum baseball bat. The boys then set fire to the family's home, in Cantonment, Florida (near Pensacola) in hopes of concealing their crime. Ricky Chavis, a family friend, was convicted of being an accessory to the murder after he hid the boys in his trailer home after the murder and washed the blood from their clothes. Chavis was also accused of molesting Alex King, but later acquitted.[1][2] Terry King was 40 years old at the time of his death.\nThe boys claimed that they committed the murder to end \"mental abuse\" including being \"stared down\" and spanked. They would change their testimony several times, first claiming that they had murdered their father on their own, then that Chavis had convinced them to kill Terry, and finally that Chavis had killed Terry King and convinced them to take the fall.[3]  Alex also testified that he had been having a sexual relationship with Chavis.[4] Chavis was acquitted of child molestation in a separate trial.[5]\nIn an unconventional move, the prosecution tried both Chavis and the King brothers for the same crime. Chavis was acquitted, and while a second degree murder conviction was obtained for the King brothers on September 6, 2002, the judge threw the conviction out because he believed that the boys' right to due process was violated. The prosecution and defense resolved the case in mediation, avoiding a new trial. Both brothers pleaded guilty to third degree murder in November 2002.[6][7]\nThe King case received a huge amount of media attention and inspired much controversy.  A book entitled A Perversion of Justice: A Southern Tragedy of Murder, Lies and Innocence Betrayed was published that argues that the boys were innocent.  In response to the accusations made in the book, David Rimmer, assistant state attorney for the state of Florida stated: \"There will always be people who believe Derek and Alex are innocent.  Just like there will always be people who believe that Michael Jackson is innocent.\"  Rimmer went on to argue that the case made by the book's authors, Kathryn Medico and Mollye Barrows was naive and that they \"may never understand\" the truth.[5]\nIn 2002, Derek King was sentenced to eight years in prison, while Alex received seven years.[8]  In 2005, Alex King (then age 15) was charged with attempting to escape from the juvenile prison in which he was incarcerated.[9]\nAt the age of 18, Alex King was released from custody on April 9, 2008, after serving six years for his part in his father's death.  Derek King was released at the age of 20 on March 7, 2009, after serving seven years for his role.\nAlex was arrested in 2011 for violating terms of parole after leaving the scene of an accident.[10]\n",

Byrd was killed and Smathers was paralyzed. Smathers has denied any threats being made: \"we see the security, he sees us, and there were no words even exchanged,\" Smathers said. \"The only thing I remember was opening my car door, and him telling me to put my hands up. After that, I was shot.\"[3]\nKendle was 29 years old when he was convicted of murdering Byrd and attempting to murder Smathers.[2]\nKendle decided to represent himself at trial. During the trial, Kendle's former attorney Carlos Pelayo Gonzalez said; \"we have physical evidence and testimonial evidence has been given pre-trial that there was another gun involved, but Mr. Kendle, because he's representing himself, doesn't know how to get that evidence to the trial\".[4]\nKendle told jurors: \"the reason the evidence was fabricated is because I'm white\". Despite a warning from the judge he added: \"The subjects I shot were African American. I can prove that [...] What they're not allowing me to tell you is that I was arrested because of the George Zimmerman shooting.\"[5]\nKendle was sentenced to life imprisonment with a twenty-five-year minimum mandatory term for the second-degree murder of Byrd, and thirty years with a twenty-five-year minimum mandatory term for the attempted second-degree murder of Smathers.[6]\nCNN and the Center for Investigative Reporting conducted a year long investigation into the licensing of armed security guards. They reported that there are no federal training standards for armed guards and that no national database exists to keep track of abuses. One of the cases they focused on was Kendle's. CNN reported that Kendle's prior convictions for DUI and public drunkenness had not disqualified him from getting an armed guard license in Florida. Additionally, he had not disclosed that he was discharged from the Navy after several alcohol-related offenses.[3]\nKendle's employer was Force Protection Security. An attorney speaking on behalf of the company's owner said Kendle had the necessary training and passed the required background checks for the position. A prison psychiatrist who examined Kendle after the shooting diagnosed him with \"impulse control disorder\" and \"anti-social personality disorder\". A second court-appointed psychiatrist determined that there is a \"substantial likelihood\" he is \"suffering from a mental illness.\" Additional diagnosis by court-appointed psychiatrists included \"unspecified schizophrenia spectrum\" and \"other psychotic disorder.\"[3]\n",

After graduating, Chillingworth served at the naval base in Key West, then attended the United States Naval Academy, where he received a commission to serve on the gunboat USS Annapolis. During World War I he served as an ensign aboard the USS Minneapolis.[1]\nAfter the war, Chillingworth returned to West Palm Beach to practice law with his father. In 1921, he began his career as county judge at age 24. He became the newly elected circuit judge in 1923, holding the position for thirty-two years until his death in 1955. He married Marjorie M. McKinley, a Cornell University student and daughter of old friends of the Chillingworth family.\nChillingworth remained in the U.S. Naval Reserves and was recalled to active duty in 1942. During World War II, he was stationed in London and Plymouth, England, where he participated in planning the occupation and recovery of Germany. He was released from active duty in 1945 as a full commander.\nA 4.1-acre (17,000\u00a0m2) neighborhood park in West Palm Beach is named in honor of Chillingworth.[3]\nChillingworth and his wife were last seen at a dinner in West Palm Beach on the evening of June 14, 1955. They left the dinner about 10\u00a0p.m. for their Manalapan home. They went to bed expecting a carpenter to arrive in the morning of June 15 to build a playground for their grandchildren.[4]\nThe carpenter arrived at 8\u00a0a.m. and observed that the Chillingworths' door had been left open and that their home appeared to be empty. Later that same day, Chillingworth failed to appear as scheduled at a 10\u00a0a.m. hearing at the courthouse in West Palm Beach.[5]\nAn accidental drowning during a morning swim was quickly ruled out, and $40 found to be in Marjorie's pocketbook ruled out robbery. The keys were still in the ignition of Chillingworth's Plymouth automobile. No further clues were obtained and (at that point) the case went cold. The couple were declared legally dead in 1957.[1] Several suspects were considered, including Charles Nelson, brother of Chillingworth's friend Trapper Nelson, whose trial for murder Chillingworth had presided over.[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "Henry Perrine (5 April 1797 \u2013 7 August 1840) was a physician, horticulturist, United States Consul in Campeche, Campeche, Mexico, and an enthusiast for introducing tropical plants into cultivation in the United States.\nHenry Edward Perrine was born April 5, 1797, at either New Brunswick, New Jersey[1][2] or Cranbury, New Jersey,[3] a son of Peter and Sarah Rozengrant Perrine, and a descendant of Daniel Perrin, \"The Huguenot\".[4] He taught school for two years while still a youth, studied medicine, and then at age 22 moved to Ripley, Illinois where he practiced medicine for five years, while also helping with the Underground Railroad in the area.[5][verification needed] In 1821 he was accidentally poisoned with arsenic, from which he never fully recovered. He married Ann Fuller Townsend in 1822 while living in Illinois.[3][6]\nCold weather particularly bothered Perrine after his arsenic poisoning, and in 1824 he moved to Natchez, Mississippi (leaving his family in Illinois) in the hope that the climate would aid his recovery. He began studying herbs and medicinal plants while in Natchez. Malaria was common in the Natchez area, and Perrine began studying the use of quinine to treat it. He published the results of his research in the Philadelphia Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences in 1826, and that report remained an important source on the subject for a century. In 1825 Perrine and his family moved to his wife Ann's hometown of Sodus, New York. Believing that he needed to move to a climate even warmer than that of Natchez, Perrine had applied in 1824 for a diplomatic position in a tropical country. In 1827 he sent copies of his report on the use of quinine to Washington. Shortly thereafter he was appointed United States Consul in Campeche, Mexico, where he served for ten years.[3][7]\nSoon after Perrine arrived in Campeche, the United States Treasury Department asked all U. S. Consuls to find useful plants that could be introduced to the United States. Perrine began investigating tropical crops for introduction into the United States. He sent seeds and plants to people he corresponded with in the southern United States, some of his specimens now reside at the New York Botanical Garden. Perrine was the only U.S. Consul to respond to the Treasury Department's request, and newspapers in the United States began writing about his work. Through correspondence with Captain DeBose, the keeper at the Cape Florida Light, with Charles Howe, postmaster and inspector of customs at Indian Key and with William A. Whitehead, mayor of Key West, Florida, Perrine became convinced that the southern tip of Florida was the only place in the United States suitable for the introduction of tropical plants. While still in Campeche and on his return to the United States, he campaigned for a land grant on which he could start a plant introduction station. Upon his return to the United States, Perrine was offered a site in Louisiana for his plant introduction station, but he rejected it, believing that only southern Florida offered the necessary climate conditions. Perrine, Judge James Webb of Key West and Charles Howe of Indian Key incorporated the Tropical Plant Company, which was chartered by the territory of Florida in 1838. Also in 1838, the United States Congress granted  Perrine his request for a survey township (36 sq. mi.) in southern Florida.[8][9][10]\nWhile waiting for hostilities with the Seminoles to die down so that his land grant could be surveyed and settled, Perrine had in late 1838 taken up residence with his family on Indian Key in the Florida Keys. While resident on Indian Key, Perrine started a tropical plant nursery on Lower Matecumbe Key. He also visited the settlement at Key Vaca to treat the Bahamians living there, and to try to convince them to grow some of the tropical plants he was trying to establish in Florida. In April, 1840 Perrine spent several days on and near Cape Sable planting seeds despite the presence of Seminoles in the area (his party could see the light of a campfire one night as they camped on the cape).[11][12]\nOn August 7, 1840, Indians attacked Indian Key. The Perrines were awoken by gunfire and shouts. Henry Perrine sent his family into the space under the house and then covered the trap-door with a chest. Ann Perrine and the three children moved to the enclosed turtle crawl under the wharf behind the house. They were able to take a boat that had been partly loaded with plunder by the Seminoles, and head for the United States Navy base on nearby Tea Table Key. They were chased by two Seminoles in a canoe, but were rescued by sailors in a whale boat. Dr. Perrine was killed in his house, which was burned by the Seminoles. Several other people on the island were also killed. Some bones found in the burned ruins of the Perrine house were buried on Lower Matecumbe Key.[13][14]\nPerrine had apparently selected Cape Sable as the site of his grant, but after his death his widow successfully petitioned to have the grant transferred to the shore of Biscayne Bay, and to remain with the Perrine family. Part of the Perrine Grant eventually became the community of Perrine, Florida.[3][15][16][17] Perrine introduced the Key lime to the United States and it has been subsequently used to develop many citrus hybrids.[2]\n",

Stowe was murdered by an unknown assailant.\nStowe was born Ellen Louise Stowe on March 19, 1956 in Little Rock, Arkansas and grew up in Arkansas, Louisiana and Nevada. Her father was an engineer.[2] When she was a teenager she moved to Las Vegas and then to Los Angeles,[3] where she worked as a stripper in an adult club.[4]\nStowe chose to call herself \"Star\" because of her love of the skies and had a blue star tattooed below her bikini line.[4]\nWhilst working in the Los Angeles strip club, she was spotted by a scout for Playboy, and asked to model for the magazine. Her shoot was photographed by Pompeo Posar,[1] and included some pictures with a Rickenbacker bass guitar.[2] The shoot was used as the centerfold in the February 1977 issue, and she was Playmate of the Month.  She was the first playmate with a visible tattoo.\nStowe at one time dated KISS founder and bassist Gene Simmons.[5] As well as taking part in a number of publicity shots for the band,[6] Stowe also appeared on one of the band's picture discs.[4]\nStowe later married and divorced Peter Maligo, with whom she had a son, Michael.[3]  Stowe moved to Fort Lauderdale in 1986 to find work as an exotic dancer.

Stowe eventually fell into prostitution, alcoholism and drug abuse.[5]\nIn 1991, Stowe moved in with a boyfriend and gave up drugs and prostitution.

The attacks caught attention of the Haitian community.[1] There was further interest in whether the murders were ordered by the Haitian military regime as that could possibly change the status of refugees from economic to political asylum seekers.[2] In addition to the journalists, radio host Ringo Cayard owned a building that was bombed after D'Or's murder, and Daniel Buron, a bus driver who supported democracy, was assassinated on 9 March 1994 in Little Haiti.[2][3][4][5] The FBI was brought in once it was determined that the motive was political.[6]\nThe three journalists belong to the group of eleven race and ethnic community journalists to be killed in the United States since 1977.[7][8][9]\nJean-Bertrand Aristide became Haiti's first democratically elected president on 7 February 1991 after a long history of dictatorships and a new Constitution. Even before the inauguration of Aristide, there was a failed coup in January 1991.[10] However, Aristide was in office less than a year before he was ousted in a military coup on 30 September 1991. Although President Aristide had a short-lived presidential term, he created hope among Haitians that their conditions would improve and managed to introduce some human rights reforms.[11][12] The military coup that overthrew the government of President Aristide was under the leadership of Lt. General Raoul C\u00e9dras, who had been selected by President Aristide to serve as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. The United States pushed those governing in Haiti to reinstate Aristide and honor the democratic vote. A multilateral effort led to the diplomatic agreement known as the Governors Island Agreement, which was signed to achieve the return of Aristide on 3 July 1993.[12][13][14] If successful, the process return of President Aristide by 30 October 1993. However, C\u00e9dras defaulted on the agreement. This led to a United Nations' mandate in July 1994 to use force, if necessary, to restore the democratically elected president. With an imminent US invasion planned for September 1994, C\u00e9dras left Haiti, which led to the return of President Aristide.[12][14][15]\nJean Claude Olivier, also known as Division Star, (ca. 1944 \u2013 18 February 1991) was a Haitian-born music promoter and radio host of the program \"Radyo Pep-la\" (Translated: Radio of the People), for WLQY-AM (1320) broadcasting in French Creole, and he was the first to be assassinated just 11 days after President Aristide took office.[16][17]\nWhile Olivier was involved with music entertainment, he shared D'Or's or St. Plite's interest in politics and engaged his audience with political talk. Similarly, he was supportive of Aristide, belonged to the political organization Veye Yo, and called for boycotts of businesses in the Little Haiti that were not supportive of Aristide or democracy.[2][16][17][18][19] He received a threat before his assassination as did D'Or.[3]\nOn the evening of 18 February, a band Olivier represented had finished playing at the Chateau Club and Olivier was leaving the nightclub. His assassin approached him and when he was close enough to Olivier, he shot the journalist three times, before making his getaway in a waiting car with a driver. The team that assassinated Olivier and the others were Haitian-Bahamian and were hired to kill from a list of names.[20][21]\nWhile WLQY is a station that serves the Miami-area, its signal carries to Haiti and has an audience there.[19]\nThe murder of Fritz D'Or, or Fritz Dor, (ca. 1953 \u2013 15 March 1991), was the second in a string of political attacks by supporters of the former Haitian military regime who were opposed to Aristide. D'Or was a US Haitian journalist and radio talk show host for WLQY-AM (1320). He was assassinated by Billy Alexander in Miami, Florida, for voicing his support for the new Haitian democracy and President Aristide.[16]\n",

A group of white men attacked African Americans who were engaging in sit-in protests opposing racial segregation. The attack took its name from the ax handles used by the attackers.\nBecause of its high visibility and patronage, Hemming Park and surrounding stores were the site of numerous civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s. Black sit-ins began on August 13, 1960, when students asked to be served at the segregated lunch counter at Woolworths, Morrison's Cafeteria, and other eateries. They were denied service and kicked, spit at and addressed with racial slurs.\nOn August 27, 1960, a group of 200 white men who were Ku Klux Klan members gathered in Hemming Park armed with baseball bats and ax handles.[2] They attacked the protesters conducting sit-ins. The violence spread, and the white mob started attacking all African Americans in sight. Rumors were rampant on both sides that the unrest was spreading around the county (in reality, the violence stayed in relatively the same location, and did not spill over into the mostly white, upper-class Cedar Hills neighborhood, for example). A black street gang called the \"Boomerangs\" came to protect the demonstrators.[3] Although police had not intervened when the protesters were attacked, they became involved, arresting members of the Boomerangs and other black residents who attempted to stop the beatings.[4][5][6]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Great Fire of Key West was a major fire that destroyed a significant portion of the city of Key West in 1886. It was the largest and most devastating fire in Key West history.[1]\nThe fire began in a coffee shop next to the San Carlos Institute. It burned for 12 hours over 50 acres, destroyed most of the commercial area of the city, killed seven people, injured 15 more, and cost one and a half million dollars in property damage.[1][2]\nThere were several compounding factors that caused the fire to burn for so long and destroy so much of the city.[1]\nSince 1875, the city had a serious fire department, organized first by A. H. Dorsett.[3] However, at the time of the fire, the city's only steam fire engine had been sent to New York for repair. Firefighters were only able to use less effective measures like hand pumpers.[4]\nSecondly, on the night when the fire occurred, strong winds were blowing, which caused the fire to start up again even where it appeared to have been put out.[1][5]\nThere is speculation that the fire was started on purpose by arsonists sent by the Spanish empire attempting to undermine Key West citizens' support for Cuban independence.[1] This stems from three key details of the fire. The fire was started immediately next to the San Carlos Institute, which was the heart of Cuban culture in Key West. The economic prosperity that Cuban emigrants found in Key West was the source of direct financial contributions to the Cuban revolution.[1] Secondly, the morning after the fire, there was a Spanish ram waiting to take on any unemployed Cuban cigar workers who wanted to return to Cuba. 400 workers returned at that time.[6] Thirdly, Havana newspapers reportedly ran an article describing the great fire the day before it actually took place.[1]\nNotable buildings destroyed by the great fire include the San Carlos Institute, City Hall, St. Paul's Church, Fire House No. 1, the Fogarty Mansion, the Patterson House, and the Key West Custom House. Because the blaze occurred in the heart of the island's business district, many cigar factories and sponge warehouses burned down, putting four thousand employees out of work.[5]\nWilliam Curry was chairman of the Relief Committee created to rebuild the city after the fire. On April 4, he publicly requested aid from US Citizens: \"A large portion of our city having been swept away by the flames, our industrial occupations entirely ruined, and thousands of our people left in other destitution and distress, we found ourselves compelled to appeal to the benevolence of our country...\"[7]\nThe local fire department took measures to better prepare for such a massive fire in the future. They purchased two new steam engines, rebuilt the firehouse, and built several new firehouses across town over the next several years.[4][8]\n",

        "paragraph": "Mark James Asay (March 12, 1964 \u2013 August 24, 2017)[1] was an American spree killer who was executed by the state of Florida for the 1987 racially motivated murders of two men in Jacksonville, Florida.[2] He was convicted, sentenced to death, and subsequently executed in 2017 at Florida State Prison by lethal injection. Asay's execution generated attention as it was noted by multiple news agencies that he was the first white person to be executed in Florida for killing a black person.[3][4] He was also the first person to be executed in the United States using the drug etomidate.[5]\nOn July 17, 1987, Asay, his brother Robbie, and friend Bubba, visited multiple bars in Jacksonville, Florida, where they drank beer and played pool. After leaving a bar in the early hours of July 18, the three men decided to head downtown to find some prostitutes. Once there, Robbie began speaking with another man, 34-year-old Robert Lee Booker, who was black. Asay grew angry and started shouting racial slurs at Booker. After the two got into a confrontation, Asay took out a gun from his back pocket and shot Booker once in the abdomen. Booker ran from the area but succumbed to his gunshot wound. The bullet penetrated Booker's intestines as well as an artery, which caused internal hemorrhaging. Booker's body was found later that day under the edge of a house. Robbie fled the area after the shooting while Asay and Bubba left in a truck. When Bubba asked him why he had shot Booker, Asay responded, \"Because you got to show a nigger who is boss.\" Asay did not believe he had killed Booker after shooting him.[6][7]\nAfterward, Asay and Bubba continued to look for prostitutes. Bubba then spotted a prostitute whom he only knew as \"Renee\" who he believed would give them oral sex. Both men were unaware that Renee was actually a 26-year-old mixed-race white and Hispanic man named Robert McDowell, who dressed as a woman. After speaking with McDowell, the two negotiated a deal for oral sex. Bubba drove himself and Asay to a nearby alley and McDowell followed them. Once there, Asay left the truck so Bubba and McDowell could have sex. As McDowell got into the truck, Asay suddenly returned, grabbed McDowell's arm, pulled him from the truck, and shot at him. Asay shot McDowell six times as he attempted to escape. Asay and Bubba then drove away, with Asay claiming he shot McDowell because \"the bitch had beat me out of ten dollars on a blow job.\" McDowell's body was found on the ground in the alley not long after the shooting. According to a medical examiner, McDowell had been shot three times in the chest cavity, any of which would have been fatal.[6][7]\nAsay later told two acquaintances that he shot McDowell because he had allegedly cheated him out of ten dollars in a drug deal. The acquaintances also testified that Asay had claimed to shoot McDowell four times in the chest and that he shot him again once he had fallen to the ground.[6][7]\nAs a result of tips from the two acquaintances and McDowell's murder being featured on a television crime watch segment, Asay was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder. He was ultimately found guilty of both murders and the jury recommended he receive the death penalty. As such, the trial court imposed a sentence of death for each conviction.[6][7] On November 18, 1988, Asay was sentenced to death for the murders of Booker and McDowell, receiving a separate death sentence for each murder.[1] Asay was prosecuted by Bernie de la Rionda, which at the time, was his first death penalty-eligible case.[8][9] Asay's death sentences were upheld in 1991 and 2000.[10][11][12]\nAsay later admitted to a Jacksonville television station that he killed McDowell but maintained his innocence in the murder of Booker.[13]\nAsay was first scheduled to be executed on March 17, 2016.[14][15] However, on March 2, the Supreme Court of Florida halted the execution after the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Florida's death penalty laws were unconstitutional, a ruling that was made in January 2016 following Hurst v. Florida. Asay's execution warrant had been signed by Governor Rick Scott prior to the ruling in early January.[16] On July 3, 2017, following months of Florida's death penalty laws being left in legal limbo, Scott signed Asay's execution warrant, scheduling him for execution on August 24, 2017.[17][18]\nAsay was to be executed via lethal injection. The execution method that was to be used included two drugs that had never been used before in a Florida execution. The two new drugs were: potassium acetate, which had only been used once before in the United States by accident in an Oklahoma execution, and etomidate, which had never been used anywhere for an execution.[19][20] The lethal injection combination was new, due to states struggling to acquire the drugs needed for lethal injection.[5] Asay's lawyers tried arguing that the new combination of drugs violated his constitutional right to an execution free from cruel and unusual punishment. Ultimately, the Supreme Court of Florida rejected the appeal and said he had failed to show that was likely.[5]\nOn August 24, 2017, Asay was executed at Florida State Prison via lethal injection, in which the new drug combination was used. He was pronounced dead at 6:22\u00a0p.m. and made no final statement.[21] His last meal consisted of fried pork chops, fried ham, French fries, vanilla swirl ice cream, and a can of Coke.[13] No one from his family witnessed the execution. It was the first execution in Florida in over nineteen months, since Oscar Ray Bolin was executed in January 2016.[22] A Florida Department of Corrections official later stated that the execution had occurred without any incident and that Asay did not speak or show any indication of pain during the execution procedure.[23]\n",

The Perrywinkles then got into his white van and went with him to Walmart, where they shopped for the next 2 hours. At 10:30 pm, Smith offered to get them cheeseburgers at the store's McDonald's and Cherish followed him. However, surveillance footage shows that they walked out of the store instead, which was the last time Cherish was seen alive. About half an hour later, Rayne called the police to report that her daughter had been abducted and an Amber alert was issued five hours later.[4] The next morning Cherish's body was found in a creek behind Highlands Baptist Church. It is believed that Smith had bound her in the back of his van, where she was sexually assaulted and strangled to death.[5]\nPolice immediately identified Smith as the abductor, with his van being one of the main focuses. Around 9 am the next day, officers saw his van on the interstate and cornered him before he surrendered and was promptly arrested. Smith was known to police as a local sex offender with a long criminal history including numerous offenses against minors. He had been released from jail only three weeks before Cherish's murder.[6]\nSmith's trial began in February 2018. He was found guilty of first-degree murder and sexual battery and was sentenced to death in May 2018. The jurors were in tears after witnessing crime scene photos of the murder as the defense tried to suppress the images. Julie Schlax, the defense attorney, urged the jurors to focus on the law and not their raw emotions.[7][8]\nIn April 2021, Smith unsuccessfully attempted to appeal his sentence.[9]\n",

Police arrested two men from Missouri for the crime: Curtis Wayne Wright Jr. and Jimmy Ray Rodgers. In December 2015, Teresa's husband, Mark Sievers, was arrested and accused of orchestrating the killing, with the motive being life insurance money, as well as the fact that Teresa was supposedly going to take his daughters away from him and he could not afford to fight for custody. All three men were found guilty of the murder. Wright was sentenced to twenty-five years, Rodgers was sentenced to life in prison, and Mark Sievers was sentenced to death.\nTeresa Sievers (born Teresa Ann Grace Tottenham) was born on November 19, 1968, at Griffin Hospital in Derby, Connecticut.[1] Her parents separated when she was one month old, and she was raised by her mother. Since sixth grade, she had an interest in medicine and wanted to become a doctor. She was the valedictorian of her high school class. In 1996, she graduated from the Ross University School of Medicine in Dominica.[1] She later completed a pre-med course at Fairfield University and completed her residency at the University of Florida.[2]\nIn 2000, she married a man named Kenny Cousins. Three years later the couple divorced, and Teresa met another man called Mark Sievers through his sister, with whom she was good friends. In 2003, Teresa married Mark and the couple had two daughters. In 2006, they moved to Bonita Springs, Florida and set up a holistic medical practice called Restorative Health and Healing Center. Shortly before her death, Teresa was profiled in a local women's magazine.[3]\nIn 2015, Mark went to the wedding of his childhood friend Curtis Wayne Wright Jr. in Missouri and confided in him that he was having marriage problems with Teresa. Mark feared she was going to take his two daughters away from him and said he could not afford to fight for custody. Wright told Mark that his only option was for her to die.[3] Mark said he would pay Wright to help him, so the two men then planned how to murder Teresa. Mark also wanted Teresa killed so he could claim life insurance money. Investigators would later discover there were five insurance policies on Teresa totaling $4.433 million. Unbeknownst to Mark, Wright later enlisted the help of a third man to assist in the killing, Jimmy Ray Rodgers, who Wright paid to help him.[4]\nOn the morning of June 27, 2015, Wright took a rental car from Hillsboro, Missouri and went to pick up Rodgers. The two men then drove over 1,000 miles to the home of Teresa Sievers in Bonita Springs, Florida. A GPS system log, which was later shown as evidence in court, tracked the route the men took. En route, they stopped at a gas station and were caught on surveillance tape. The men arrived at Teresa's home at approximately 6:00\u00a0a.m. on the morning of Sunday, June 28, 2015. They entered the property and disabled the security alarm before leaving and taking another drive. The men were caught on surveillance tape at a local Walmart store where they purchased trash bags, wet wipes, black towels, black shoes, and a lock-picking kit. They then returned to Teresa's home and waited for several hours until she returned.[5]\nTeresa landed at Southwest Florida International Airport that night, having cut short a family vacation in Connecticut. Mark had driven her to LaGuardia Airport in New York City earlier in the day so she could catch a flight home.[4] She had flown home alone so she could see patients at her clinic the following morning. She was last seen alive on surveillance video at the airport in Florida. Teresa returned to her home where she was ambushed by Wright and Rodgers. The two men attacked her in the kitchen and struck her repeatedly with a hammer. Teresa was hit a total of seventeen times and was bludgeoned to death.[5] Her killers then left and drove back to Missouri in the early hours of June 29.[6]\nOn June 29, 2015, Teresa was found dead at her home by a family friend. Mark had called the friend to check up on her after she failed to show up at work. She was discovered lying on the kitchen floor and investigators found a hammer next to her body. A week later, her funeral took place at Unity Church in Naples. Mark attended the funeral and walked down the church aisle with his two daughters, appearing distraught. At the funeral, he gave a speech and said, \"I was, and still am, the luckiest man in the world.\"[7]\nNo leads came in the case for nearly two months. In August 2015, police acted on a tip and arrested Rodgers and Wright in Missouri. Both men were charged with murder. Rodger's girlfriend helped police with their investigation and told them that Rodgers had admitted to killing Teresa Sievers. She claimed that Rodgers had told her that Mark Sievers had hired Wright, who then hired Rodgers to murder his wife for life insurance money.[4]\nIn December 2015, Mark Sievers was charged with murder after a connection was found between him and Wright. Suspicion had been on Mark from early on. Hours after Teresa's funeral, investigators had watched him throw computer equipment into a dumpster behind the couple's medical office. While Mark had initially been cooperative and handed over his cell phone to investigators, he later refused to cooperate.[7]\n",

The trip was planned to last for four months and began on July 2, 2021, but Petito disappeared in late August.\nAfter Petito's disappearance, Laundrie raised suspicion when he drove the van from Wyoming back to his parents' Florida home and refused to discuss her whereabouts. He was deemed a person of interest in the case and an arrest warrant was issued on charges of him making withdrawals using her debit card. He left his home on September 13 and was reported missing four days later.\nOn September 19, Petito's remains were found in Wyoming's Bridger\u2013Teton National Forest. An autopsy found that she was killed by manual strangulation. After a month of speculation around Laundrie's whereabouts, and an extended search of the area around his home, his skeletal remains were discovered in Florida's Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park on October 20. It was confirmed by an autopsy on November 23 that Laundrie had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, and the FBI later announced that he had admitted to killing Petito in his notebook, which was found near his remains.\nThe case gained widespread attention due to the couple's documenting of their travels on social media, leaked police body camera video footage, 9-1-1 emergency dispatch call recordings, eyewitness accounts, the actions of Laundrie's parents, and the extensive media coverage.\nGabrielle Venora Petito (March 19, 1999 \u2013 c. late August 2021) was born and raised in Blue Point, New York.[1] She had six younger siblings and half-siblings. In 2013, Petito and her step-brothers appeared in a music video to raise awareness about American gun violence in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[2][3] In 2017, she graduated from Bayport-Blue Point High School in Bayport, New York,[4] where she met Brian Christopher Laundrie.[5] From September 2017 to January 2019, she lived in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, working as a hostess and in the kitchen of a restaurant in nearby Wilmington. She applied to Cape Fear Community College, but did not attend.[6]\nPetito began dating Laundrie in March 2019,[7] and moved in with him and his parents in North Port, Florida. The couple worked at a Publix in North Port, where she was a pharmacy technician and he was in the grocery department. They quit their jobs at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.[5][8]\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, the couple embarked on a cross-country drive from New York to California. Along the way, they visited Las Vegas, Yosemite National Park, Pismo Beach, and other points of interest.[4] In March 2020, Petito celebrated her 21st birthday in Nokomis, Florida.[4] She and Laundrie visited Sope Creek, Georgia, in June 2020, and the two were engaged the following month.[9]\nIn December 2020, Petito purchased a 2012 Ford Transit Connect van converted into a camper, in which the couple would take their next cross-country trip.[10] To save money for the trip, she began working 50-hour weeks at Taco Bell[8] and as a nutritionist while Laundrie took a job at an organic juice bar.[11] Petito documented her life and travels on social media sites such as YouTube and Instagram, where she described her interests as \"art, yoga, and veggies\".[4][5]\n",

Conahan was convicted of one murder, but has been linked to a dozen murders, mostly of transients seeking employment and gay men in the Charlotte County, Florida area in what came to be known as the Hog Trail Murders.\nConahan was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and moved with his family to Punta Gorda, Florida, shortly after birth. When he was a teenager, he discovered he was homosexual; this displeased his parents, who sent him to several psychiatrists. He graduated Miami Norland High School in 1973 and joined the United States Navy in 1977, stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois. In 1978, he was nearly court-martialed for taking fellow Naval officers off base for sex, and was discharged a few months later after getting into a fight with a man upon whom he had attempted to force oral sex.[2]\nAfter his Navy discharge, Conahan stayed in Chicago for 13 years before moving back to Punta Gorda to live with his elderly parents in 1993. In 1995, he became a licensed practical nurse, graduating at the top of his class from Charlotte Vocational-Technical Center.[2] He was employed by Charlotte Regional Medical Center in Punta Gorda.[citation needed]\nOn February 1, 1994, the mutilated corpse of a man was discovered in Punta Gorda. The body had been outside for about a month and had rope burns on the skin and the genitalia had been removed and discarded. The man was not identified[3] until 2021, when the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office announced that new DNA testing confirmed the victim as Gerald (Jerry) Lombard, of Lowell, Massachusetts.[4][5]\nOn January 1, 1996, a North Port family's dog brought home a male human skull. Police eventually pieced together much of a skeleton and determined that the genitalia had been cut out, similar to the 1994 victim (Lombard). The North Port skeleton has not been identified.[6]\nA third man's mutilated body was discovered in North Port on March 7, 1996. He had been killed only 10 days earlier.[7] He also remained unidentified until June 1999, when he was identified as John William Melaragno.[8]\nAnother man's skull was found in Charlotte County on April 17, 1996. Police searched the surrounding woods and found the rest of the man as well as a second body. The second was a man who had been raped, murdered, and mutilated only the day before, and was identified as Richard Allen Montgomery.[9][10][11] The first body was later identified as Kenneth Lee Smith.[12][13] Speculation became rampant about a serial killer, and the media dubbed the murders \"The Hog Trail Killings\", named for the wooded areas in which the bodies of the victims were found.[13]\nFacial reconstruction of (previously) unidentified victim, known as John Doe #1; DNA tests in 2021 confirm identity as Gerald (Jerry) Lombard.\nIn May 1996, a few witnesses directed police to Daniel Conahan, including one who had escaped him when Conahan's car became stuck while driving him down a dirt road.[14] Later, police linked Conahan to a 1994 Fort Myers police report where Stanley Burden had been propositioned, tied to a tree, and nearly strangled. Burden survived and had rope scars on his body two years later.[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "Rolando Arcadio Masferrer Rojas (1918\u20131975), was born on July 12, 1918,[1] in Holguin, former Oriente Province, Cuba, better known simply as Rolando Masferrer, was a Cuban henchman, lawyer, congressman, newspaper publisher and a political activist.[2][3] He was killed in Miami, United States, on October 31, 1975.[4]\nMasferrer was a member of the Joven Cuba organization as a teenager.\nHe later formed part of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish civil war and he also was a member of Cuba's Communist Party. He was wounded in the left foot in Spain, and in Europe is said to have been an enforcer for International Brigades much feared for the thumping of his wounded gait when he approached his victim.[5][citation needed]\nHe was a rival of Fidel Castro in the bloody feuds of the trigger happy action groups and subject of at least one failed attempt by Castro to kill him. Masferrer also participated, with Castro, in the Cayo Confites expedition of 1947, which sought to overthrow Rafael Trujillo, the authoritarian leader of the Dominican Republic. Masferrer was elected to the Cuban House of Representatives in 1949.\nMasferrer was a staunch supporter of Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista. He was not only a Senator in the Batista government but more importantly the leading founder of Los Tigres de Masferrer, a paramilitary organization set up to protect Batista from guerrilla groups and to support Batista militarily.  In this period he published two papers Tiempo in Havana and Libertad in Santiago de Cuba which insulted Francisco Franco, but without positive reaction among other leftwing Spanish Civil war exiles.[6]\nDuring the final years of the last Batista regime to (the end of 1958), Masferrer and his tigers operated in Oriente province; often, it is said,  out headquarters in Victoria de las Tunas, others say in Santiago, Manzanillo and Bayamo [7] where he had an array of exotic weapons including very lethal large caliber \"air rifles.\"  At times his followers penetrated the Sierra Maestra with stealthy silence, terrifying some local Escopeteros who without time to react or appropriated weapons to face him fled before his forces; then the \"tigres\" vanished.  In this  fashion the Tigres apparently too stealthy to be opposed raided and killed throughout the foot hills of the Sierra Maestra.[8] He is known to have threatened Franciscan priests in Manzanillo, Cuba (de Paz, pp.\u00a081\u201382).  The Cuban government of Fidel Castro accused Masferrer of 2,000 killings, but also says that the Tigres were careful to remove all evidence.[7]\nMasferrer was ingenious and intelligent, he plotted to buy \"La Hacienda Sevilla\" and divide up the land so as to reward the local guajiros for informing on Fidel Castro in the first months of his operations in the Sierra Maestra.  This connection may or may not explain the attempted betrayal of Castro by Agrarian Organizer Eutimio Guerra.[8][9]\nRegardless that Masferrer had been a Communist supporter, after Fidel Castro took over Cuba's presidency on January 9, 1959, Masferrer had to abandon the island, because Castro accused him of stealing US$10 million. He left in a boat, landing in Miami.\nIn the United States, he befriended Mafia bosses such as Santo Trafficante, as well union leader Jimmy Hoffa. He established the 30th of November organization, with the purpose of killing Castro. Masferrer was also known for mistreating Cubans residing in Florida, extorting money from them for what he said was \"to help Cuba\".\n",

        "paragraph": "Sheriff of Palm Beach County\nThe 1967 Riviera Beach riot was one of 159 riots during the Long, hot summer of 1967. It would originate in Riviera Beach, Florida but later it would spill over into nearby West Palm Beach.[1]\nPrior to the riots, Riviera Beach had racial segregation seen residentially and through education. One predominantly white subdivision was surrounded by a wall which separated it from the nearby black neighborhoods. Black residents were not allowed to visit a nearby beach on Singer Island.[1]\nAt the time of the riots, Palm Beach County had one black in their judiciary, Edward Rodgers who served as an assistant prosecutor. He was also an attorney and substitute municipal judge. Riviera Beach's residents at the time were mostly black yet its police force would be mostly composed of white officers.[1] That same day, Riviera Beach officials would dedicate two segregated recreational facilities.[2] The riots would be on the day after William Heidtman, an active Republican Party member who was also an accountant and insurance salesman was appointed as the Sheriff of Palm Beach County by Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr.[1]\nAfter a fight broke out at the Blue Heron Bar located near the Port of Palm Beach on July 30, 1967. The police arrested a 27-year-old black man named James Mitchell and the reason for his arrest was unclear. At the time of the arrest, most of the patrons at the bar were black. A rumor about Mitchel being abused by the police was spread around. The patrons themselves taunted the police and followed the officers outside. After the arrest another rumor was spread that the police assaulted innocent bystanders.[1][2]\n400 blacks would pour into the streets and the riots would begin, lasting for four hours. 45 arrests would be made in total during the riots and tear gas would be used. 14 teenagers would be arrested in West Palm Beach on charges of arson and possessing materials to create fire bombs. 2 warehouses owned by the Mullins Lumber Company would catch on fire and cause $350,000 in damages. At an unspecified time during the riots, the crowd would throw bricks and bottles at firefighters demanding that Mitchell be released. The police would let go of Mitchell briefly in an attempt to cool tensions and insisted he was not hurt by the police. Governor Claude Kirk would visit Riviera Beach during the riots at an unknown time to talk with local officials and the National Guard. He would offer to impose a curfew but local officials took it down. National Guard troopers were prepared for possible usage but never requested.[2][3] All 36 officers from the Rivera Beach Police Department were deployed and it would be assisted by a 40 member \"riot squad\" from the Sheriff's Department. 156 National Guard soldiers were assigned to protect an armory for a period of four hours before being dismissed from duty.[4]\nOn July 31, the Riviera Beach city council held a meeting where residents accused the police department of their brutality and discriminatory traffic enforcement towards the local black community. Sheriff Heidtman would ask for a sizable increase in the Sheriff's Department's riot-related expenses during that day. Politicians in Florida would attempt to place the blame ranging from Fidel Castro, H. Rap Brown, and Stokely Carmichael. On the evening of July 31, Walter Cronkite announced the riot's occurrence in Riviera Beach.[2] Also during that evening, the police would disperse a crowd gathering at Rosemary Avenue and Fourth Street in West Palm Beach. The bail for those who were arrested was reduced four days after the riots and most would be released. Despite Palm Beach County Criminal Court Judge Russell H. McIntosh refusing to lower bail until they were charged and the backgrounds of them were investigated. McIntosh would appoint Rogers, as 1 of 5 members of a bail reduction committee. The committee ended up reducing the bail amount eventually four days later.[2] For several days afterwards, local residents were afraid of a flair up with liquor stores being boarded up and gun stores would remove weapons from display. The Mullins family who owned the warehouses, would end up selling them as their insurance provider ended up paying 20% of their insurance claim and a business venture they had in The Bahamas failed at roughly the same time.[1]\nThe local African\u2013American community would say that the riots were fueled by the poor housing conditions and a lack of recreation facilities within their community. When Sheriff Heidtman was writing a report to the Governor about the riots, he would blame news media rhetoric saying that riots would happen across the United States. The reasons proposed by African\u2013Americans would go ignored. Local officials and media would praise law enforcement's handling of the situation.[5]\nAt some point after the riots, a federal jobs program would be brought to the city.[1][2] In the following years after the riots, the representation of African-Americans would increase at the county and municipal level. Palm Beach County would elect the first African-American member to the School District of Palm Beach County in 1970.[6] Four years after the riots would happen, the city council would become majority black.[1][2]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nGary Ronnie Stewart (May 28, 1944 \u2013 December 16, 2003)[1] was an American musician and songwriter, known for his distinctive vibrato voice and his outlaw country sound influenced by southern rock. At the height of his popularity in the mid-1970s, Time magazine described him as the \"king of honkytonk.\"[2] He had a series of country chart hits from the mid- to late 1970s, the biggest of which was \"She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)\", which topped the U.S. country singles chart in 1975.\nOn December 16, 2003, Stewart died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, one month after the death of his wife.[3][4][5]\nStewart was born in Jenkins, Kentucky, on May 28, 1944, the son of George and Georgia Stewart. He was named after the actor Gary Cooper.  In 1959 his father, a coal miner, sustained an injury while working in the mines, and shortly afterwards the family moved to Fort Pierce, a city on Florida's Atlantic coast.[6]\nLearning guitar and piano, Stewart began touring with local bands and writing songs in his teens.  He married Mary Lou Taylor, who was more than three years his senior, at age seventeen and began working days in an airplane factory.  He still played in rock and country bands at night.  While playing in an Okeechobee, Florida, honky-tonk known as the Wagon Wheel, Stewart met country singer Mel Tillis, who advised Stewart to travel to Nashville to pitch his songs.  He recorded a few songs for the small Cory label in 1964 and began co-writing songs with local policeman Bill Eldridge.  Stewart and Eldridge wrote Stonewall Jackson's 1965 country hit, \"Poor Red Georgia Dirt\". Signed to the Kapp label in 1968, Stewart made several unsuccessful recordings but several songwriting successes followed, for artists like Billy Walker (\"She Goes Walking Through My Mind\", \"Traces of a Woman\", \"It's Time to Love Her\"), Cal Smith (\"You Can't Housebreak a Tomcat\", \"It Takes Me All Night Long\"), and Nat Stuckey (\"Sweet Thang And Cisco\"). He even played piano for a time in Charley Pride's band the Pridesmen, and can be heard on Pride's live In Person double-album. Disappointed with Music Row, however, he soon returned to Florida and resumed playing countrified rock 'n' roll in local clubs and bars.[7]  In 1970 Motown Records, hoping to get Nashville artists to record their songs, paid Stewart $30 to record countrified demos of \"Baby I Need Your Loving\", \"Yester-Me, Yester-You, Yesterday\", and \"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\".[8]\nIn case it's not clear why rock and rollers are so excited about a new country singer, it's because he really sings rockabilly, which supposedly flourished for a few years in the mid-'50s and then vanished. What I like best about this compilation of flop singles from a few years ago is the way Stewart transforms rockabilly's adolescent phobias about wimmin into unabashed burlesques involving the likes of 'Big Bertha' and 'The Snuff Queen.'\n\u2014Review of You're Not the Woman You Used to Be in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981)[9]\nStewart was dropped from Kapp and then from Decca, but a series of demo tapes, including the countrified Motown tunes, found their way into the hands of producer Roy Dea, who convinced Jerry Bradley to sign Stewart to RCA Records.  He returned to Nashville in 1973 and recorded a cover version of \"Ramblin' Man\" by the Allman Brothers, both of whom were Stewart's personal friends. It charted at only #63 on the country chart, but his follow-up, 1974's \"Drinkin' Thing\" became a top ten hit. His album Out of Hand was released in early 1975. \"Out of Hand\", the title cut, became a #4 country hit and was followed by the #1 hit \"She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles)\".[10][8]\nThe album Out of Hand, which climbed to #6 on the Billboard country album chart, has since become one of the most critically lauded country albums of the 1970s. Village Voice critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A\u2212 saying that it \"was the best regular issue country LP I've heard in about five years.\"[11] Rolling Stone gave it high praise as well, stating that, \"With practitioners like Stewart around, honky-tonk\u2014and rockabilly\u2014may not be dead yet.\"[12] Thom Jurek of AllMusic later gave the album five of five stars and stated that a \"strong case could be made for Out of Hand as one of the Top 100 country records of all time. It might be in this writer's Top Ten!\"[13] Country music critic Bill Malone called Out of Hand \"one of the greatest honky-tonk country albums ever recorded.\"[14]\n",

Five 9-1-1 calls were made that day, including one by Lee herself from her abductor's phone and one from a witness, Jane Kowalski, who gave a detailed account of events as they unfolded before her. Failures were found in the way the 9-1-1 operators handled Kowalski's call, and additional failures were identified nationwide in the 9-1-1 system. King was sentenced to death.[1]\nThe Denise Amber Lee Act was passed unanimously by the Florida Legislature on April 24, 2008.[2][3] This act provides for optional training for 9-1-1 operators. Lee's family continue to lobby for a new law to be passed nationwide that would institute mandatory training and certification for all 9-1-1 dispatchers. The Denise Amber Lee Foundation was established in June 2008 to promote such training as well as to raise public awareness of the issues involved. Lee was the daughter of a police detective, Sgt Rick Goff.\nDenise Amber Lee (n\u00e9e Goff) (August 6, 1986 \u2013 January 17, 2008) was born in Englewood, Florida. Lee was the daughter of Sgt. Rick Goff, of the sheriff's office in Charlotte County, Florida[4] and Sue Goff.[5] Not long after their first date, Lee's future husband, Nathan, bought her a $40 heart-shaped ring which she never removed. The ring later became key evidence connecting perpetrator and victim.[4][6]\nMichael Lee King (born May 4, 1971)[7] trained as a plumber[8] but had been unemployed for several months before the crime and was facing foreclosure on his home in North Port, Florida. He was married but is now divorced.[9] He has a low IQ, and family members described to the court how King had an accident while sledding as a child; an expert witness described the subsequent injury as a \"divot\" in his brain.[6]\nOn January 17, 2008,[9][10] Michael King abducted Denise Amber Lee from her home. He drove her around, tied up in his vehicle, for quite some time; several people witnessed the journey. Later, King raped and murdered Lee and buried her in a shallow grave. Her body was found on January 19, 2008. King was found guilty of kidnapping, sexual battery, and first-degree murder; he was sentenced to death and is presently detained awaiting execution.[1]\nNathan Lee was at work that Thursday (January 17, 2008); his wife, Denise Lee, was home with their two young children. She called him at 11:21\u00a0a.m., the last time the two would speak. Among the topics discussed was the nice weather: the couple decided that the windows should be open at home. She said she had already opened them. Nathan Lee arrived home around 3:30\u00a0p.m. to find the windows closed, his wife missing, and the children home alone in the same crib. This prompted him to make his 9-1-1 call, the first of the day related to this crime.\nA neighbor saw a car arrive at Lee's home around 2 p.m. The car was later identified as Michael King's dark green 1994 Chevrolet Camaro.\nLee was bound and taken to King's home in North Port, Florida, where he set up what the prosecution in the trial referred to as a \"rape room.\" Duct tape and other evidence were found in this room.\n",

He built speedboats for the Shah of Iran, Charles Keating, Robert Vesco, Malcolm Forbes, and George H. W. Bush. Retired President Lyndon B. Johnson owned several 16\u00a0ft. Donzi speedboats on his Texas ranch with which he would race his Secret Service agents.\nAronow was born in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn,[1] the youngest son of Russian-Jewish immigrants[2] Herman and Ruth Aronow.[1] He had two elder sisters, Sylvia and Lillian.[1] His father owned a gas station and then a taxi company which collapsed during the Great Depression.[1] He graduated a top athlete from James Madison High School in 1944,[1] worked as a life guard at Coney Island, and enrolled at Brooklyn College.[1] In 1945, he joined the merchant marine and worked overseas until the end of World War II.[2] In 1947, he returned to the USA and completed his studies graduating from Brooklyn College in 1948 with a physical education degree[1] earning letters in football, wrestling, and track.[1]\nAfter school, he worked as a physical education teacher for a time until he accepted a job at his father-in-law's southern New Jersey construction business which was booming thanks to demand from returning World War II veterans.[1] In 1953, he established his own construction company, the Aronow Corporation which quickly became one of the largest construction companies in the state.[1][2] In 1959, at age of 32, the now-millionaire Aronow moved to Miami with his family, where he began racing boats as a hobby.[2]\nThe hobby evolved into a business and by the end of 1962, he had formed the Formula Marine boat company, which he then sold to Merrick Lewis' Alliance Machine Corp out of Dayton, Ohio. In 1964 he started Donzi Marine; the Donzi brand became an international success and Aronow quickly sold the company to Teleflex Inc. in mid-1965. In 1966, he founded Magnum Marine and in 1967 proceeded to win his first World Championship driving two 27' Magnums, a single engine inboard and a triple engine Mercury-powered outboard.\nSince he was not supposed to be building boats in 1969, according to his non-compete clause following the sale of Magnum Marine, Aronow built the first Cigarette boat under the name Cary, with the help of Elton Cary's Miami Beach facility. \nAfter campaigning his boat \"The Cigarette\" around the world with mechanic Norris \"Knocky\" House as his cockpit companion, he won his second World Championship in three years, and third consecutive United States Championship while becoming only the 2nd American in history to win the UIM Gold Medal of Honor (Gar Wood was America's first UIM champion). \nOnce Aronow was able to formally open his new company, he started Cigarette Racing Team using his own designs in 1970. Having sold Cigarette for the last time in 1982 (after having sold it and purchasing it back in the late 1970s while merging it with his own Squadron Marine), he formed USA Racing Team and built the Blue Thunders, 39-foot catamarans used by the United States Customs Service to patrol U.S. waters and run down illegal offshore activities, especially drug smuggling. Aronow's close friend at the time, Vice President George Bush, was a former Cigarette owner and was involved in testing out the 39-foot cats prior to government approval.\nAronow's boats won over 350 offshore races and he was a two-time world champion and three-time U.S. champion. He has been elected to every powerboating Hall of Fame in existence and as stated above, he and Gar Wood were the only two Americans to have ever received the UIM Gold Medal of Honor.\nThe great speed of Cigarette boats also made them a popular choice among cocaine smugglers. On February 3, 1987, Aronow was murdered in his car at the end of 188th Street in North Miami Beach where his boat companies operated. Aronow had just left a meeting with Bob Saccenti, part owner of Apache Power Boats together with partner Ben Kramer. Witnesses said a powder blue Lincoln pulled up next to Aronow's car from the opposite direction, and when Aronow rolled down its window the driver opened fire. Another witness tried to follow the Lincoln as it fled but could not catch the killer(s). The Lincoln drove over the grass to get away.\nNearly a decade later, two men pleaded no contest to charges related to Aronow's killing.[3]  In 1995, career criminal Bobby Young admitted to shooting Aronow and pleaded no contest to second degree murder, eventually providing a full confession in 2009 shortly before his death.[3]  Ben Kramer, winner of the 1986 American Power Boat Association Offshore Championship, pleaded no contest to manslaughter in 1996.[3][4][5]  Kramer had a business dispute with Aronow after buying the latter's USA Racing Team but was forced to sell it back to Aronow after the Customs Service refused to do business with him.[3]  Kramer was already in prison on a life sentence with no possibility of parole following 1988 and 1989 convictions for drug smuggling and gun charges, as well as receiving a 1990 conviction for a failed escape attempt by helicopter from a federal prison near Miami.[4]\nThe story was also the basis for the 2009 documentary film Thunder Man: The Don Aronow Story and the 2018 movie Speed Kills with John Travolta.\n",

Black (who served 9 years with Florida Highway Patrol) and 39-year-old Ontario Provincial Police Corporal Donald Irwin (who served 18 years with Ontario Provincial Police), a visiting Canadian constable and friend of Black. The officers were killed during a traffic stop where Tafero, his wife Sunny Jacobs and their children were passengers. Tafero's execution was botched; his head burst into flames during the execution by electric chair. After Tafero's execution, the driver, Walter Rhodes, confessed to shooting the officers, but later retracted his testimony.[1]\nAt the time of the murders, Tafero was on parole for attempted rape, holding two women hostage.[2][3]\nOn the morning of February 20, 1976, Black and Irwin approached a car parked at a rest stop for a routine check. Tafero, his wife Sonia \"Sunny\" Jacobs, their two children (ages 9 years and 10 months) and Walter Rhodes were found asleep inside. Tafero had previously been in prison and was on probation. Black saw a gun lying on the floor inside the car. He woke the occupants and had first asked Rhodes then Tafero to come out of the car.\nAccording to Rhodes, Tafero then shot both Black and Irwin with the gun (which was legally registered to Jacobs who bought guns on behalf of Tafero \u2013 he couldn't legally obtain a license because of his record) and led the others into the police car to flee the scene. According to Tafero, Rhodes shot the officers and handed the gun to him so that Rhodes could drive.[4]\nThey later disposed of the police car and kidnapped a man and stole his car. All three were arrested after being caught in a roadblock. When they were arrested, the gun was found in Tafero's waistband. This account, however, was later contradicted by Rhodes; there was subsequently enough evidence to support reasonable doubt regarding Tafero's conviction.[4][5]\nGunpowder tests found residue on Rhodes consistent with \"having discharged a weapon\", residue on Tafero consistent with \"handling an unclean or recently discharged weapon, or possibly discharging a weapon\", as well as residue on Jacobs and her son consistent with \"having handled an unclean or recently discharged weapon\".[5]\nPrior to his conviction for murder, Tafero had been convicted of attempted robbery and \"crimes against nature\" when he was 20 years old.[6][7]\nRhodes entered into a plea agreement for a reduced sentence of second degree murder in exchange for his testimony against Tafero and Jacobs.[4] At their trial, he testified that Jacobs fired first from the back seat, then Tafero took the gun from her and shot the two officers.[5] Rhodes later recanted his testimony on three occasions, in 1977, 1979 and 1982, stating that he shot the policemen, but ultimately reverted to his original testimony.[8]\nTafero and Jacobs were convicted of capital murder and were sentenced to death while Rhodes was sentenced to three life terms. He was released in 1994 following parole for good behavior.  The children were placed in the care of Sunny Jacobs's parents until their deaths in a 1982 plane crash. The children were then separated and Sunny's younger child, Christina, was placed into foster care with a friend of Jacobs.\nTafero and Jacobs continued their relationship through letters while serving time in the prison. Because there was no death row for women in Florida, Jacobs was put into solitary confinement for the first five years of her imprisonment and let out only once or twice a week for exercise. She learned yoga to pass the time, and after being moved to the general prison population, began teaching yoga to other prisoners.\n",

        "paragraph": "Hank Earl Carr (January 31, 1968 \u2013 May 19, 1998)[1] was a convicted criminal who, on May 19, 1998, shot his girlfriend's four-year-old son with a rifle, was arrested, and then escaped from his handcuffs and killed two Tampa detectives and a Florida state trooper. Carr then barricaded himself in a convenience store and held a clerk hostage before committing suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\nThe murders of the law-enforcement personnel prompted national controversy on the proper way to handcuff a suspected criminal, and local media were widely criticized for inhibiting police work while Carr was trapped in the convenience store.\nOn the morning of May 19, around 10:30\u00a0a.m., Carr carried the young son of his girlfriend Bernice Bowen into a fire station. The boy had a gunshot wound to the head, but the circumstances of the injury were unclear \u2014 first Carr claimed that the boy was dragging a rifle and walking around when it accidentally discharged, but later he said that he himself had been holding it when it discharged.\nCarr, having told police he was Joseph Bennett, the father of the child, ran back to the site of the shooting while being pursued by police. Threatening an officer with a rifle, he dropped it and again ran away, and this time was caught and handcuffed. Tampa Police Department detectives Randy Bell and Ricky Childers took him back to the apartment where the boy had been shot to continue to interview him. On the trip back to the police department, with Bell and Childers in the front seats and Carr sitting behind them, handcuffed in front, Carr successfully unlocked his handcuffs with a key he carried on his person, he then disarmed Childers by snatching his Glock handgun from his shoulder holster. In the struggle that ensued, Carr shot both officers in the face, killing them at the scene.[2]\nExiting the car, he carjacked a pickup truck and fled. After briefly visiting his mother and refueling at a local service station, he got on Interstate 75 heading north. The first police officer in pursuit was Florida State Trooper James Crooks, and as he approached, Carr veered onto an exit ramp located in Pasco County, Florida, braked, and exited the truck. As Crooks also braked to a stop, Carr approached and shot him twice in the head, killing him instantly.[3]\nGetting back in the pickup truck, Carr fled as multiple police cars and a police helicopter pursued him in a high-speed chase and gunfight. With his tires blown out and running low on ammunition, Carr exited the interstate and entered a convenience store, where he took as a hostage Stephanie Kramer, a pregnant clerk. For the rest of the afternoon, he remained in the store, as nearly 200 officers surrounded him. Local radio station WFLA conducted phone interviews in the midst of the crisis, later drawing criticism from both journalism experts and police.[4] At 7:20\u00a0p.m., Carr released Kramer and shot and killed himself as the SWAT team forcibly entered the building.\nBowen's son ultimately died, raising the number killed by Carr to four. In later testimony it was revealed that he abused Bowen and her children, and he was found to be a convicted felon with a history of violent crime, including assault of police officers. He was also wanted in several states.\nIn 1999, Bowen was convicted of child neglect for allowing Carr around her children. Prosecutors contended that since Bowen knew of Carr's violent history, she should have never allowed him to be around children. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison.[5] Later in 1999, she was charged with aiding and abetting Carr's escape, as well as for being an accessory to the murders of her son and the three police officers. Even after one officer broke down and begged her to tell them Carr's real name, Bowen didn't do so. Prosecutors claimed that if she had, police would have known he was a convicted felon and used tougher measures in handling him.\nShe was sentenced to 21.5 years in prison, to run concurrently with her child neglect sentence. However, those convictions were thrown out on appeal in 2001. A state appeals court found that prosecutors focused too much on what Bowen should have done to prevent Carr's rampage, rather than what she did after the crimes were committed. The court also acquitted her of aiding and abetting the deaths of her son and Trooper Crooks.[6] She was convicted of the remaining charges in 2002, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Sentencing guidelines called for only 6\u201311 years, but in sentencing her, the judge said that Bowen's lies to police were so egregious that they endangered the public.[7] This sentence also runs concurrently with her child abuse sentence, and she was released in October 2016.[8][9]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJames Delano Winkles (December 18, 1940 \u2013 September 9, 2010) was an American murderer, kidnapper and self-confessed serial killer. Initially sentenced to life imprisonment on kidnapping charges, he admitted responsibility for two murders committed in Pinellas County, Florida during the 1980s, for which he was convicted and sentenced to death. Winkles claimed that he had killed a total of 62 people during his lifetime, but no other murders were definitively corroborated, and he died awaiting execution in 2010.\nFrom 1963 to 1982, Winkles moved around various counties across Florida, amassing arrests for multiple felonies. He made a living by stealing and doing odd jobs, only occasionally taking up work as a mechanic. Twice divorced, he eventually married for a third time to a woman named Mary Thomas, who gave birth to a child sometime in the mid-1970s. The pair would remain married until his final arrest.\nOn September 12, 1981, Winkles was arrested in Pinellas County on charges of fraud for selling forged documents, but was released from custody after posting bail.[1] A month later, the decapitated body of a woman was found on a property in Citrus County, and while the coroner was unable to establish the cause of death, he put the victim's date of death as sometime between late September or early October. Winkles became a suspect after an anonymous witness contacted the authorities and claimed that they had seen Winkles' wife on the property. While Winkles admitted that they had camped out there in early October, he claimed that he was unaware that of the body. His testimony was corroborated by his wife, and since there was insufficient evidence to charge them, the pair were released.\nOn January 6, 1982, Winkles entered a real estate agency based in Seminole County and, using the alias 'David Longstreet', asked the 28-year-old saleswoman Donna Maltby to show him some of the homes for sale. After he chose one of the properties, they arranged to meet on the next day for a detailed inspection. On the early morning, Winkles called the agency and said that his car had broken down, requesting that Maltby pick him up from the parking lot of a hotel he was staying at. After she arrived, he told her that he had managed to fix up his car and offered to drive her to the property, to which Maltby agreed. Along the way, however, Winkles sexually assaulted and then stabbed her several times with a knife. He then tied her up and threw her onto the back seat of the car where, under knifepoint, he stole her money and credit cards.\nWinkles had intended to drive Maltby to Tampa, where he had a rental apartment, but lost his way in the fog and had to stop at a gas station in Pine Hills.[2] To avoid arousing suspicion, he removed her restraints and ordered her to seat in the front seat. Despite his death threats, Maltby managed to get out of the car and call for help, whereupon the employees called the police. Winkles was arrested soon afterwards and brought to the police station, where he tried to claim that he had seen Maltby stealing $8,900 from her agency's cash register, but no such money was found. He then tried to convince the investigators that he had no intention of abducting or assaulting her, but a search of his vehicle turned up drugs, a set of handcuffs, rope, duct tape, bottles of alcoholic beverages and a briefcase containing women's underwear that did not belong to Maltby.\nAccording to the investigators, the items found during the search were likely tools used in abductions of other victims, with the women's underwear possibly being fragments of their clothing which was kept as a trophy. Winkles was eventually charged with rape and kidnapping, for which he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment on July 15, 1982.[3] He attempted to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming that his lawyer had lied to him about what the max possible sentence could be.[4] This motion was denied by a judge, and his life term was upheld.[5]\nIn August 1983, forensic analysis identified the victim found in Citrus County as 39-year-old Margo Delimon, a real estate agent who went missing on October 3, 1981.[6] Authorities then interviewed Winkles' wife again, with Thomas revealing that she had jewelry and a photograph of a woman among her husband's possessions, but did not know who they belonged to or who the woman was. After Delimon's identification, Thomas confirmed that she was the woman in the photograph.\nAs both Delimon and Maltby worked in real estate agencies, investigators suspected that Winkles kidnapped and murdered the former due to the similar modus operandi. Around this time, he was proposed as a suspect in the disappearance of 19-year-old Elizabeth Graham, an employee of a mobile grooming service that went missing on September 9, 1980.[7] Her van was found abandoned near a vacant house in Largo, with one of the tires being punctured by a knife.[8] However, as Graham's body had not been located at the time, authorities were unable to charge Winkles in her case. For the remainder of the 1980s until the late 1990s, he remained the prime suspect in the murders and disappearances of several women around Florida, but was never charged.[9]\n",

John Marek and his accomplice Raymond Dewayne Wigley stopped and convinced Adella Marie Simmons to ride with them to a service station. They instead took her to a beach about 60 miles away, where she was repeatedly sexually assaulted, and then strangled with a bandana and burned. \nMarek's accomplice Raymond Wigley was killed by fellow inmate John Richard Blackwelder while serving life imprisonment in 2000.[4][5] At trial, Blackwelder said he killed Wigley because he (Blackwelder) wanted to die. He was sentenced to death for killing Wigley and gave up all his appeals. Blackwelder was executed on May 26, 2004.[6]\nMarek was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on May 13, 2009, inside the Florida State Prison near Starke, Florida, after Governor Charlie Crist signed a death warrant.[7][8] However, at the last moment the execution did not go through. On July 16, the Florida Supreme Court lifted the stay of execution with Charlie Crist shortly afterwards setting the date of execution to August 19, 2009, at 6 p.m. inside Florida State Prison.[9][10] Marek's attorney filed a motion claiming there was a new witness attesting that Marek did not kill Simmons.

The method of execution was lethal injection. The execution itself took 13 minutes and Marek was declared dead at 6:33\u00a0p.m. Marek had declined sedatives and his final words were \"Jesus, remember us sinners\", followed by the Lord's Prayer. Marek became the 68th death row inmate to be executed in Florida since the death sentence was reinstated there in 1979.[12]\n",

Following this, the City discussed purchasing the Nightclub for $2.25 million, but the vote was postponed.[3]\nIn the end, Pulse Nightclub owner, Barbara Poma, cited personal and emotional connection to the site as the main reasons as to why she chose not to sell the property.[4] Since this time, Poma and others have been raising funds for a memorial, museum, and scholarships through her nonprofit, the onePULSE Foundation.[5]\nThe onePULSE Foundation released a request for proposals in March 2019, with proposals being due by January 31, 2020. Six finalists were selected from the total 68 submissions received, with the final design being chosen from Coldefy & Associes with RDAI.[6][7] The selection process was completed by a blue-ribbon jury made up of representatives from onePulse, the Orlando community, architect professionals, and others. The decision was made as a collective group, with consideration in mind to the over 2,300 comments that were submitted from the victims' families, survivors, and the community with recommendations for memorial concepts.[8]\nThe current design includes several pieces that come together to form a community presence and dedicated reflective, interactive, and connective spaces. The National Pulse Memorial has the focus of serving as a quiet and peaceful garden setting, and is set to include different symbolic features such as 49 trees, 49 color lines, and a reflecting pool surrounding the Pulse building, to honor the 49 victims lost in the events of the Pulse shooting. A separate museum will be located at 438 West Kaley Street, Orlando, FL 32806, and will be erected in a shape representing a growing flower. The museum will serve as an interactive center to learn, gather, and host community programming. In total, the project is set to cost $45 million to complete.[15] Entrance to the memorial will be free year-round, but the museum will have an admission charge.[16] Architectural renderings and videos have been made available to the public to view and comment on the onePULSE foundation's website.[6]\nThe plans have received some criticism from survivors and families of victims for being too large and expensive,[17] as well as due to unpermitted renovations and code violations documented at the nightclub at the time of the shooting.[18]\n",

In 1974, Knight murdered a Miami couple after forcing them to withdraw $50,000 USD from a bank. While awaiting trial, Knight and ten other inmates escaped from jail and went on a crime spree, during which he murdered a store clerk in an armed robbery. He was added to the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list[2] on December 12, 1974, and was captured on December 31, 1974.[3]\nKnight was sentenced to death in 1975 for the Miami murders. While on death row, he committed a fourth murder, in which he fatally stabbed a corrections officer. After spending thirty-nine years on death row, Knight was executed on January 7, 2014. He holds the record for spending the longest amount of time on death row in the United States before being executed. Knight was once described as a poster boy for the death penalty and his case has been referenced by supporters of capital punishment.[4]\nKnight was born on February 4, 1951, in Fort Pierce, Florida.[5] He was the second oldest of nine children and came from a family with a history of mental illness. His father was a violent alcoholic who regularly beat his children and once raped Knight's sister in front of him. When Knight was nine, he was arrested for theft multiple times. At age fifteen, he was sent to state prison on a burglary conviction. He was later committed to the Northeast Florida State Hospital in Macclenny at the age of nineteen, where he was diagnosed with drug and poison intoxication and paranoid personality disorder.[6]\nOn July 17, 1974, a then 23-year-old Knight approached his boss, Sydney Gans, in a parking lot. Armed with a rifle, Knight forced Gans into his car and ordered him to drive to his Miami Beach home and pick up his wife, Lillian Gans. Sydney obeyed Knight's demands and collected his wife. Knight then ordered the couple to drive to a bank in downtown Miami and withdraw $50,000 USD in cash. While Sydney went to collect the money, Lillian drove Knight around in the car. Inside the bank, Sydney withdrew the cash, but alerted people inside about the current situation. Staff at the bank called the FBI who then contacted the Miami Police Department. Sydney returned to the car with the money and the three of them drove off, with Miami police tailing the vehicle. The police lost sight of the vehicle momentarily but later found it at a secluded construction area with the doors left open. Police prepared to search the area but quickly spotted Knight, who was armed with the rifle. Knight fled on foot into some trees nearby and escaped. Officers then found the dead bodies of both Lillian and Sydney. Lillian was found dead in the car and Sydney was found dead about 25 feet (7.6\u00a0m) away, both had died from gunshot wounds to the neck.[7] Four and a half hours later, Knight was apprehended by the police. He was found with his rifle and the stolen $50,000 USD.[8]\nWhile awaiting trial for the murders of Sydney and Lillian Gans, Knight and ten other prisoners escaped from the Miami-Dade County Jail, on September 19, 1974. Two days later, eight of the eleven escapees were captured, with only Knight and two others remaining at large.[9] While on the run, Knight committed several armed robberies and hold ups. On October 21, 1974, Knight and an accomplice held up a liquor store in Cordele, Georgia. The clerk, William Culpepper, was then shot three times by Knight during the robbery. Culpepper died at the scene and another clerk, A.V. Norton, was shot twice but survived. The pair stole $640 USD in the robbery.[10]\nOn December 12, 1974, Knight was added to the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. On December 31, 1974, an FBI SWAT team captured Knight at a rooming house in New Smyrna Beach, Florida.[11] Despite being heavily armed and barricaded behind a door, Knight was overwhelmed by the FBI SWAT team and was arrested. At the time of his capture, Knight had an arsenal of weapons including a sawed-off shotgun, a 9mm automatic, and a .38 caliber revolver, all of which had been stolen from Titusville. Knight was the 328th fugitive to be placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted fugitives list and spent nearly three weeks on the list before being captured. Since his escape from jail, he spent just over three months as a fugitive before police apprehended him.[10]\nOn April 21, 1975, Knight was sentenced to death for the murders of Sydney and Lillian Gans.[9] On October 12, 1980, while on death row, Knight fatally stabbed state corrections officer Richard Burke with a sharpened spoon at Florida State Prison.[12] The reason Knight killed him was reportedly because the prison would not let him see his mother, who was making her first visit to see him.[13] According to court documents, Knight stabbed Burke as he was escorting him to the prison shower. The prison wanted Knight to shave his full beard off before seeing any visitors which had angered him. On January 20, 1983, Knight was sentenced to death again for the murder of Burke.[14][15]\nKnight's execution was delayed repeatedly because of multiple appeals and rulings. In 1987, a federal appeals court removed his original death sentence for the Miami murders because he had not been allowed to have any background witnesses on the stand during his penalty phase.[16] He spent so long on death row that he was nearly granted a stay to hear a claim that it may be ruled unconstitutional to execute an inmate after such a long time on death row. The Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear his final appeals however.[17]\nKnight was executed on January 7, 2014, via lethal injection at Florida State Prison in Raiford, Florida. He was the first person to be executed in the United States in 2014. He spent a total of thirty-nine years on death row until his execution was carried out. He holds the record for spending the longest amount of time on death row in the United States before being executed. His last meal consisted of sweet potato pie, coconut cake, banana nut bread, a quarter bottle of Sprite, two tablespoons of strawberries, butter-pecan ice cream, vanilla ice cream and Fritos corn chips.[18] He declined to make a final statement.[19] While on death row, Knight converted to Islam and changed his name to Askari Abdullah Muhammad.[20]\n",

Known as Marc to avoid confusion with a paternal uncle also named Richard, he graduated from Irmo High School in 1980 at age 16.[2]\nAfter high school, Evonitz worked briefly as the manager of a Jiffy Lube, before joining the United States Navy. He served as a sonar technician and received a Good Conduct Medal before being honorably discharged after eight years of service.[4]\nFollowing his stint in the Navy, Evonitz worked steadily at businesses that sold compressors and grinding equipment. He filed for bankruptcy in 1997, unable to keep up with bills following a divorce, and had a house foreclosed in 1999 following a failed business venture, but at the time of his death, Evonitz had been working at an air-compressor company since moving to South Carolina a few years earlier.[4]\nEvonitz was married twice, first to Bonnie Lou Gower from 1988 to 1996, then to Hope Marie Crowley from 1999 until his death.[2]\nIn January 1987, Evonitz exposed himself and masturbated in front of a 15-year-old girl in Orange Park, Florida. He was arrested a month later when his ship returned to port. He entered a plea of no contest and was sentenced to three years' probation.[5]\nEvonitz is suspected of a 1994 abduction and rape and a 1995 rape in Spotsylvania, Virginia.[4]\nOn September 9, 1996, Evonitz abducted 16-year-old Sofia Silva from her front yard near Loriella Park in Spotsylvania County. Her decomposed body was found a month later in a creek off State Route 3 in King George County.[6]\n",

He was the founder of Versace, an international luxury-fashion house that produces accessories, fragrances, make-up, home furnishings and clothes. He also designed costumes for theatre and films. As a friend of Eric Clapton, Princess Diana, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Madonna, Elton John, Tupac Shakur and many other celebrities, he was one of the first designers to link fashion to the music world.[4] He and his partner Antonio D'Amico were regulars on the international party scene.[5] The place where he was born and raised, Reggio di Calabria, greatly influenced his career.\nOn 15 July 1997, he was murdered outside his Miami Beach mansion, Casa Casuarina, by spree killer Andrew Cunanan.[6][7][8]\nGiovanni Maria Versace was born in the city of Reggio Calabria on 2 December 1946 and grew up with his elder brother Santo Versace and younger sister Donatella Versace, along with their father and dressmaker mother, Francesca.[9] An older sister, Tina, died at age 12 because of an improperly treated tetanus infection.[10]\nVersace was strongly influenced by ancient Greek history, which dominates the historical landscape of his birthplace. He attended Liceo Classico Tommaso Campanella, where he studied Latin and ancient Greek, without completing the course. He was also influenced by Andy Warhol.[11]\nVersace began his apprenticeship at a young age at his mother's sewing business, which employed up to a dozen seamstresses.[9] He became interested in architecture before moving to Milan at the age of 26 to work in fashion design.\nIn 1973, he became the designer of \"Byblos\", a successful Genny's youthful line, and in 1977, he designed Complice, another, more experimental, line for Genny.[12] A few years later, encouraged by his success, Versace presented his first signature collection for women at the Palazzo Della Permanente Art Museum of Milan.[13] His first fashion show followed in September of the same year. His first boutique was opened in Milan's Via della Spiga in 1978.[14]\nAfter opening his Milan boutique in 1978, Versace quickly became a sensation on the international fashion scene. His designs employed vivid colors, bold prints and sexy cuts, which were a refreshing contrast to the prevailing taste for muted colors and simplicity. His aesthetic, which \"combined luxurious classicism with overt sexuality\", attracted much criticism in addition to praise.[15] He is quoted as saying, \"I don't believe in good taste\", which was reflected in his \"brazen defiance of the rules of fashion\".[15] A saying referencing Versace's rivalry with Giorgio Armani was: \"Armani dresses the wife, Versace dresses the mistress.\"[16]\nFrom 1978, Versace built the company with the support of his family, employing his sister Donatella as vice president and his brother Santo as president of the company.[17] Donatella's purview extended to creative oversight, where she acted as a key consultant to Versace. Gianni would also come to employ Donatella's husband, Paul Beck, as menswear director.[18]\n",

Whites killed four black men, including Charles Wright, who was lynched by being burned at the stake, and they also destroyed several buildings in the black community of Perry after the murder of Ruby Hendry, a white female schoolteacher.[1] [2]\nThe body of a young white woman, Annie \"Ruby\" Hendry, was found with her throat slashed, lying in a pool of blood, at 4:40\u00a0p.m. on December 2, 1922, in Perry in Taylor County, Florida.

On December 6, Cubrit Dixon, a black man coming from Madison County into Taylor County, was stopped and told to put his hands up by armed citizens who had been deputized. Dixon was shot and killed when he did not comply, and witnesses said he had seemed to be reaching for a gun in his back pocket. Examination of his body found only a closed pocketknife in his back pocket.[5]\nOn December 7, Albert Young, another black man, was arrested in Valdosta, Georgia. Young was an escaped convict from Kindlon, Georgia, and an acquaintance of Wright\u2019s. On December 8, Charley Wright was arrested in Madison County and identified by police as having used the name \"Jim Stalworth\".

Wright was determined by the mob to be guilty and burned to death. Young was returned to sheriff's custody and taken to the jail in Taylor County. On December 12, when Young was being moved from the jail, he was abducted and shot to death by a smaller mob.[7]\nThe Madison\u2013Enterprise newspaper reported on December 15, 1922, that a black man in Perry had been \"accused of writing 'an improper note' to a white woman. As retribution for these actions, the man was shot to death in his home and his home was burned down on him.\"[4]\nWright, a 21-year-old escaped convict, and Albert (or Arthur) Young, his alleged accomplice, were arrested and jailed for Hendry's murder.[2]  A mob several thousand strong, made up of local and out-of-state whites, seized the accused from the sheriff, and extracted a \"confession\" from Wright by torturing him.[1]  Wright claimed to have acted alone. He was subsequently burned at the stake and the crowd collected souvenirs of his body parts and clothing. Following this, two more black men were shot and hanged.

McGreevy, 64, was smothered to death in her home with a pillow.[2]\nSix months later, on March 8, 1965, 38-year-old Sylvia Valdez left her workplace at about 9:00 p.m. She walked to the parking lot where her car was parked, and discovered it had a flat tire. At 10:30 p.m., a parking lot attendant changed Valdez's tire and saw her speaking with two Cuban men as he walked away. Valdez was found dead in her car the next morning. A black silk scarf was wrapped around her neck, and her skirt was pulled over her head. She was also shot behind the right ear twice with a .22 caliber pistol. Although her purse, shoes, and car keys were stolen, the perpetrator didn't take other valuable items from her, such as her diamond ring. It was also determined that Valdez had not been sexually assaulted.[2]\nIn February of 1966, 44-year-old Bernadita Gonzalez was last seen alive in a Miami beauty salon. Eight weeks later, her decomposing body was discovered floating face down in Levitz Lake by a highway patrolman. The medical examiner determined that she died from blunt-force trauma to the skull, which may have been inflicted by a hatchet. The perpetrator took her underwear, but left her jewelry on her.[3]\nSherivon Dolores Wooten, a 21-year-old black woman, was the next victim. On August 16, 1969, her dead body was found on a dirt road between two homes. Like the previous victims, she was strangled to death, and her clothes were hiked over her breasts. There were also fingernail marks on her neck. Wooten was last seen leaving her house the night before her body was found.[4]\nOn May 5, 1970, 64-year-old Mary Louise Clark Danford was found strangled to death in her home by worried friends \u2013 who came to check on Danford after she stopped answering their phone calls. Danford was found on her bed with her sweater pushed up and her underwear missing. She was last seen buying groceries a few hours before her body was discovered. The perpetrator gained entry into the home through a small window.[3]\nThe next victim was 64-year-old Ruth Boehner, whose body was discovered in her apartment on June 2, 1970. Her cause of death was blunt-force trauma to the head, neck, and jaw. Additionally, Boehner had been strangled, which caused her hyoid bone to break. Her nightgown was also pulled up, and her clothes were disheveled. There was no evidence of forced entry into the apartment.[4]\nOn August 5, 1970, 84-year-old Mattie Ophelia Harris was strangled to death with a necktie in her kitchen. Her nightgown had also been pulled up, and her house was ransacked.[3]\nOn October 10, 1970, Regina Bonnanno, a 48-year-old deaf-mute woman, was found dead in her apartment. She was bound to her bed, and her bra and a scarf were tied around her neck. Panties had also been stuffed in her mouth, and her head was shoved inside of a pillowcase.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "Frederick George Barker (December 12, 1901 \u2013 January 16, 1935) was an American criminal who, along with Alvin Karpis, co-founded the Barker-Karpis gang, which committed numerous robberies, murders and kidnappings during the 1930s. Barker was the youngest son of Ma Barker, all of whose children were criminals. He was killed in a lengthy gunfight with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1935.\nFred Barker was born to George Elias and Arizona Donnie Clark \"Ma\" Barker in Aurora, Missouri on December 12, 1901. The family moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1912. Barker's older brothers Herman, Lloyd and Arthur were committing crimes throughout his childhood, belonging to a gang of local delinquent youths called the Central Park Gang. The gang met in the park to plan crimes and stash their stolen goods. There, Barker met future members of the Barker-Karpis gang, including Volney Davis. He was first arrested and imprisoned in 1927 for burglary. While in prison he met Alvin Karpis. According to Karpis, Barker was a dominant figure in jail who was able to obtain marijuana and other perks. Karpis also said he was a \"natural born killer\" who \"never hesitated\".[1] Unlike Karpis (nicknamed \"Creepy Karpis\"), Barker was known for his personal charm. He was released in 1930.\nAfter their release, Barker and Karpis joined up to commit a string of burglaries in Kansas, often collaborating with other local criminals. Several notable gangsters joined the Barkers in various crimes, including Harvey Bailey, Frank Nash, Fred Goetz, and Dr. Joseph Moran. They were accompanied by Ma Barker and her boyfriend, Arthur Dunlop (sometimes called Dunlap). \nThings became difficult for the gang when they were confronted by Sheriff C. Roy Kelly in December 1931. Karpis and Barker shot and killed Kelly, an act that forced them to flee the area. The two had also probably killed an Arkansas police chief, Manley Jackson, a month earlier, but had avoided suspicion at the time.[2] The gang relocated to Minnesota, where, in 1932, Barker, his brother Arthur, Karpis, and Lawrence DeVol robbed Third Northwestern National Bank in Minneapolis. DeVol killed policemen Ira Leon Evans and Leo Gorski during the escape, while Barker murdered Oscar Erickson, a passing motorist.[3] Barker and Karpis were also suspected of killing Dunlop, an alcoholic whom they considered to be untrustworthy after someone tipped police to the gang's hideout. According to other gang members, Dunlop was also abusive to Ma. \nAround this time Barker started a relationship with Paula Harmon, widow of bank robber Charles Harmon. Karpis did not approve of Paula, considering her to be a \"drunk\" and a \"rotten choice, though you couldn't tell that to Freddie\".[4]\nThe gang became nationally notorious in 1933-4, when they organized the kidnappings of local businessmen William Hamm and Edward Bremer. The crimes were orchestrated by racketeers Jack Peifer and Harry Sawyer with inside information about police activity being provided by corrupt officer Tom Brown, who ran the \"Kidnap Squad\". Arthur carried out the kidnappings with a different accomplice each time. During the Bremer kidnapping, Barker nearly shot dead the victim when the ransom was not paid promptly. They netted $100,000 for the first victim and twice that for the second.\nWith the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in pursuit, Barker and Karpis attempted to get plastic surgery to alter their appearance and remove their fingerprints. The procedure was carried out by Moran, an underworld doctor. The operations were so painful that Fred asked one of his friends to shoot him to stop the pain, but his friend refused. Moran disappeared shortly thereafter. A badly decomposed body was discovered a year later washed up from Lake Erie on Crystal Beach, Ontario, Canada. Police identified it as Moran. In 1971, Karpis wrote in his autobiography that the identification was mistaken; he claimed that Moran had been murdered by the Barkers and then buried in a lime pit in Michigan.[5] The most accepted version of the tale is that Karpis and Fred Barker took Moran on a boat ride on Lake Erie, during which they both murdered him. He was killed either for his botched surgery or for shooting his mouth off about the gang in a brothel.[6][7] The last time Moran was seen alive was at a brothel in which he drunkenly bragged, \"I have you guys in the palm of my hand\". He left the bar with Karpis and Barker and was never seen again.\nAfter this the gang attempted to launder the ransom money, though this proved to be difficult because the serial numbers had been recorded by the FBI, a fact that soon became known to the gang. While Harry Sawyer traveled to Cuba to launder the money, his wife Gladys and Fred's girlfriend Paula were arrested for drunk and disorderly behavior at a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio. Paula had a mental breakdown while being questioned and was returned to her family in Texas.[8] Barker moved to Cuba with his brother, his mother, and Karpis. However, they soon relocated to Florida after Karpis became concerned that the money had not been adequately laundered. They rented a lakeside property in Ocklawaha under the pseudonym \"Blackburn\", claiming to be a mother and sons wanting to vacation in a country retreat.\nArthur soon left Florida for Chicago. Karpis also moved on, leaving Fred and Ma in the house. FBI agents caught up with them after Arthur was spotted and arrested in Chicago on January 8, 1935. A map found in his possession indicated that other gang members were in Ocklawaha, but did not identify the address. The FBI soon located the house at which they were staying after identifying references to a local alligator named \"Old Joe\" and questioning locals about newcomers.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn February 14, 2018, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Miami suburban town of Parkland, Florida, murdering 17 people[note 2] and injuring 17 others.[2][3][4] Cruz, a former student at the school, fled the scene on foot by blending in with other students, and was arrested without incident approximately one hour later in nearby Coral Springs.[5] Police and prosecutors investigated \"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\".[6]\nThe killing spree is the deadliest high school shooting in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre that killed 15, including the perpetrators, in Colorado in April 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

        "paragraph": "Race riots in Miami include a series of violent events that occurred in Miami mainly through the 1980s. After desegregation, much of the racial violence in Miami had calmed only to be reignited by the 1980s.[1] The decade of riots were the result of policing controversies and ethnic tensions fueled by the perceived threat of recent immigrants to African Americans on the Miami job market.[2]\nIn the United States through the 1960s, desegregation was empowering once disadvantaged African American communities to reach new political and economic gains. In Miami the Cuban exile seemed to undercut new African American gains as Cubans began to compete for jobs, residence, and political power. The later perceived successes of many Cubans gave a feeling of powerlessness to local African Americans. Many Cuban refugees lacked English language skills and ended up living in lower income neighborhoods and taking up blue collar jobs that many African Americans also held. In 1963, Ebony magazine characterized the Cuban exile as an \"invasion\" bringing in \"grave social and economic problems.\"[3]\nBy 1968, Miami witnessed a riot in its Liberty City neighborhood during the 1968 Republican National Convention, caused by the frustration African Americans faced in the country.[4] By the 1970s, the Hispanic population of Miami outnumbered the African American population and more Hispanic owned businesses had been opened than African American owned businesses.[3]\nBetween the 1968 Miami riot and the 1980 Miami riots, up to thirteen \"mini-riots\" would occur in Miami, all stemming from police confrontations with African-Americans.[5]\nThe 1980 riots were race riots that occurred in Miami, starting in earnest on May 18, 1980, following the acquittal of police officers who had beaten black motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie.[6]\nAfter the accidental police shooting of a man in an Overtown video arcade, a riot broke out in the neighborhood. Cars were burned, businesses were looted, and police were shot at. Ivey Kearson, director of the Overtown Jobs Program, said of the riot's cause \"unemployment in the area is 50 percent or higher.\" \"Most of the people here, they don't see anything happening for them and their neighbors and the guy down the street.\" \"It's not just going to be in Miami and it's not going to just be blacks. People feel they have to react violently.\"[7] The policemen in the original arcade shooting were Latin American. \"Leave these Latins get out of here, right now,\" shouted the Rev. Jonathan Rolle, in a television interview about the incident. Later, in a phone interview, he would say, \"The Latin police, they just ride around in their cars, and they never get out\". \". . . . The Latins are the ones who are killing the blacks.\"[8]\nThe 1989 Miami riot came after police officer William Lozano shot Clement Lloyd, who was fleeing another officer on a motorcycle. He crashed and his passenger, Allan Blanchard, was also killed. Four days of rioting later took place in Overtown.[9] On January 21 after the shooting, violence erupted in Overtown and the next day in Liberty City.[10] Schools were closed and police cordoned off a 130-block area and teargassed rioting crowds.[11]\nAfter the arrest of Haitian demonstrators picketing a Cuban owned business, believed to have harassed Haitian customers, and the condemnation of Nelson Mandela's visit to Miami by many Cuban city officials, many black business organizations boycotted Miami entirely throughout the summer of 1990. This boycott was dubbed at the time as a \"quiet riot\". The boycott was noteworthy for its peaceful and successful tactics as compared to the recent riots.[12] In the end $50,000,000 dollars was lost due to cancelled conventions in the city and ended with various business deals in the city to help expand black owned businesses and attract black professionals.[13]\nAfter police shot a shooting suspect in Overtown, rioting broke out in majority black neighborhoods of Liberty City, Overtown, and to a lighter degree in Coconut Grove. Twenty people were arrested after rocks were thrown at a police station, a city bus, and a dumpster was set on fire.[14]\n",

De Mohrenschildt later alleged that their friendship continued until Oswald's death two days after the assassination of U.S. president John F. Kennedy. In actuality, De Mohrenschildt never saw Oswald, or wrote to him, after April 13, 1963\u2014three days after Oswald's alleged attempt on the life of General Edwin Walker.\nDe Mohrenschildt's testimony before the Warren Commission investigating the assassination was one of the longest of any witness.[2][3]\nDe Mohrenschildt was born as Jerzy Sergius von Mohrenschildt in Mozyr, in the Russian Empire, now in Belarus, on April 4 in the old-style Russian Julian calendar.[4] He had an older brother, Dimitri. His aristocratic father, Sergey Alexandrovich von Mohrenschildt, was of Baltic German, Swedish, and Russian descent. De Mohrenschildt's mother, Alexandra, was of aristocratic Polish, Russian, and Hungarian descent.[4]\nSergey von Mohrenschildt was described by his son as the Marshal of Nobility of the Minsk Governorate[5][6] from 1913-1917, and a civil rank of Actual Civil Councilor corresponding to Major General. In 1920, during the Russian Civil War, Sergey von Mohrenschildt was arrested by the Bolsheviks for anti-Soviet agitation.[7] He was sentenced to exile for life in Veliky Ustyug, a town in the north of Russia. De Mohrenschildt later testified to the Warren Commission that, while awaiting transport to Veliky Ustyug, his father became ill. Two Belarusian Jewish doctors who treated him in jail advised him to stop eating so he would appear more sickly. The doctors then told the Soviet government that Sergey was too ill to survive the trip to Veliky Ustyug and he should be allowed to recover at home. The Soviet Government agreed, under the condition that Sergey check in weekly until he was well enough to be sent to Veliky Ustyug. After his release, Sergey, his wife and the young de Mohrenschildt then fled to the Second Polish Republic in a hay wagon (de Mohrenschildt's older brother Dimitri, who was awaiting execution, was later repatriated to Poland as part of a prisoner exchange).[8][9] During their journey, de Mohrenschildt, his father and mother Alexandra contracted typhoid fever. Alexandra died of the disease shortly after the family crossed into Poland.[4]\nAfter the death of his mother, de Mohrenschildt and his father made their way to Wilno, where the family owned a six-acre estate. De Mohrenschildt graduated from the Wilno gymnasium in 1929 and later graduated from the Polish Cavalry Academy in 1931.[10] He went on to earn a master's degree at the Institute of Higher Commercial Studies.[11] Having completed a dissertation on the economic influence of the U.S. on Latin America, he received a doctor of science degree in international commerce from the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium in 1938.[12]\nGeorge von Mohrenschildt emigrated to the United States in May 1938, after which he legally changed the nobiliary particle in his name from the Germanic \"von\" to the French \"de\".[13][14][15] According to de Mohrenschildt, he gathered information about people involved in pro-Nazi activities, such as those bidding for US oil leases on behalf of Nazi Germany before the US became involved in World War II.[16] De Mohrenschildt testified that a further purpose of his data collection was to help the French outbid the Germans.[17]\nDe Mohrenschildt spent the summer of 1938 with his older brother Dimitri von Mohrenschildt on Long Island, New York. Like George, Dimitri was a staunch anti-communist,[18] but was also an agent of General William J. Donovan's OSS and, during the Cold War, one of the founders of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.[19]\nWhile in New York, de Mohrenschildt became acquainted with the Bouvier family, including the young Jacqueline Bouvier, the future First Lady of the United States. Jacqueline grew up calling de Mohrenschildt \"Uncle George\" and would sit on his knee.[20] He became a close friend of Jacqueline's aunt Edith Bouvier Beale.[21]\nDe Mohrenschildt dabbled in the insurance business from 1939 to 1941, but failed his broker's examination.[22] In 1941, he became associated with Film Facts in New York, a production company owned by his cousin, Berend Maydell, also known as Baron Maydell (or Count Maydell) who allegedly had pro-Nazi sympathies.[citation needed] (De Mohrenschildt denied any Nazi sympathies of his own and claimed to have helped raise money in America for the Polish resistance.)[citation needed] For this reason, De Mohrenschildt made a documentary film about resistance fighters in Poland.[23] According to a memo by former CIA director Richard Helms, de Mohrenschildt \"was alleged to be a Nazi espionage agent.\"[24]\n",

While serving a life sentence for murder, Beamon murdered two inmates, both of whom served time for sex crimes against children. He would profess his hatred for sex offenders, saying that killing them gave him \"the best feeling I\u2019ve had in a long time\", and that he would continue to kill them unless he was executed. Beamon was sentenced to death but committed suicide on death row in 2020.[1]\nOn February 6, 2005, Rocky Beamon and his girlfriend, Karen Wilkins, murdered Debbie Lacey. Beamon hit Lacey, tied her hands behind her back, and held her in water until she drowned. They then took her car and traded it with two men for crack cocaine. The two were arrested after police found the two men driving Lacey's car.\nTo avoid a possible death sentence, Beamon pleaded guilty to first degree murder and was sentenced to life without parole. During his sentencing hearing, Lacey's family spoke.\n\"I don't know what to say to somebody who doesn't have a soul,\" said Barry Grant, Lacey's nephew.\nGrant read a letter written by Lacey's daughter, 16-year-old Sara Cash. Cash wrote that she has dreams of her future, but her mother will not be there. \"She won't be there when my kids are born,\" she wrote. \"You took that away from me.\" Lacey's niece, Jill Morris, threw the harshest words at Beamon. \"God says we should forgive,\" Morris said. \"I'm not there yet I hate you with every ounce of my soul.\"\nThe mother of Beamon's two children, a 7-year-old and a 17-month-old, told Lacey's family she was sorry for what he did but she reminded them that her family also will suffer every day. Beamon's mother likewise expressed her sorrow. Then, she told her son she loved him. As she spoke, Beamon's hands began to shake. His knees buckled slightly, then he took a couple of steps backward. After using a paper towel to wipe his face, he stood straight, folding his hands in front of him. Judge Ronald Ficarrotta sentenced Beamon to life in prison. Turning to Lacey's family, Ficarrotta said he wanted to do more. \"I wish there were some wise words I could say to help you with your Outside the courthouse, Shirley Grant, Lacey's sister, said she felt justice was served. She said the family will return to court when it's time for Wilkins to face her charges. \"We are here to stand by Debbie,\" Grant said, \"no matter how many times we have to come to court.\"[2]\nWilkins pleaded guilty to second degree murder and was sentenced to 30 years in prison and 10 years of probation. \"When you go to bed at night, I hope you think about the suffering and struggling she went through,\" said Shirley Grant, while holding a picture of her. \"I hope when you wake up it's still on your mind.\"\nSara Cash told Wilkins that her mother never will get a chance to see her get married and have children of her own. \"I have to live with that every day,\" she said. After the hearing, family members said the two hearings have begun to take a toll on Cash. She has suffered nightmares as the reality of her mother's death sinks in. Barry Grant, Lacey's nephew, said Beamon did the dirty work but Wilkins is just as guilty for going along with it. Mike Wilkins, Karen Wilkins' veil ex-husband, said he considered speaking with Lacey's family after the hearing, but saw how upset they were and didn't want to make matters worse. \"My heart goes out to them,\" he said.[3]\nWilkins is serving her sentence at Lowell Correctional Institution.\n",

Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes tied to a concrete block around their necks. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted billboards bearing enlarged images of the suspect's handwriting recovered from a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting.\nPrior to his arrest, Chandler worked as an unlicensed aluminum-siding contractor. Against the advice of his attorneys, he testified in his own defense, saying he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions. Chandler said he never saw them again, except in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution. During his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he did not have a single visitor.\nChandler was executed on November 15, 2011. He wrote a last statement to prison officials: \"You are killing a [sic] innocent man today\". The statement was read at a post-execution news conference. In February 2014, DNA evidence identified Chandler as the murderer of Ivelisse Berrios-Beguerisse, who was found dead in Coral Springs, Florida, on November 27, 1990.\nChandler was the fourth of five children born to Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson, and was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio.[1] When he was ten\u00a0years old in June 1957, his father hanged himself in the basement of the family's apartment.[1] At the funeral, Chandler jumped into his father's open grave as the gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt.[1][2] Between May and September 1991\u200d\u2014\u200cconcurrent with the police investigation of the Rogers family triple murder\u200d\u2014\u200cChandler was an informant for the U.S. Customs Bureau's Tampa office.[2][3]\nWhen Chandler was fourteen, he began stealing cars and was arrested twenty times as a juvenile.[1] As an adult, he was charged with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery.[4] He was also accused of masturbating while peeping through a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple's home, held them at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear, tied her up, and rubbed the barrel of his revolver across her stomach.[2]\nOn May 26, 1989, Joan \"Jo\" Rogers, 36, and her daughters\u200d\u2014\u200cMichelle, 17, and Christe, 14\u200d\u2014\u200cleft their family dairy farm in Willshire, Ohio, for a vacation in Florida.[5][6] It was the first time they had left their home state. Authorities believe Joan became lost on June 1 during the return drive from Orlando to Willshire, and had decided to take an extra vacation day in Tampa.[7] While looking for their hotel they encountered Chandler, who gave them directions and offered to meet them again later to take them on a sunset cruise of Tampa Bay.[1] Joan and her teenage daughters had left Orlando around 9:00\u00a0a.m.[8] and checked into the Days Inn on Route 60 at 12:30\u00a0p.m.[9]\nPhotographs retrieved from a roll of film found in a camera in the Rogers' hotel room showed Michelle sitting on the floor. The last photograph was taken from the hotel balcony and showed the sun beginning to set over Tampa Bay, confirming that all three family members were alive and had not left their hotel room as the sunset began.[10] They were last seen alive at the hotel's restaurant at around 7:30\u00a0p.m. It is believed they boarded Chandler's boat by the dock on the Courtney Campbell Causeway\u2014part of Route 60\u2014between 8:30\u00a0p.m. and 9:00\u00a0p.m., and that they were dead by 3\u00a0a.m. the next day.[11] Chandler may have used the fact that he was born in Ohio to lure them into feeling a connection to him.[12] Chandler knew Joan and her daughters were not from Florida because he saw the Ohio license plates on their car.[13][14]\nThe victims' bodies were found floating in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989.[15] The first body was found when several people on board a sailboat crossing under the Sunshine Skyway saw an object in the water.[16] The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles (3\u00a0km) north of the first. While the Coast Guard were recovering the second body, a call about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards (200\u00a0m) to the east, was received. All three female bodies were found floating face down, bound with a rope around the neck, and naked below the waist.[17]\n",

Thirty-year-old Tommy Zeigler was charged for the quadruple murder of his wife, her parents, and another man at his family-owned furniture store. He was tried and convicted on July 2, 1976. Zeigler was sentenced to death on July 16, 1976, for two of the murders, in addition to life imprisonment.[1][2]\nOn July 2, 1976, thirty-year-old William Thomas \"Tommy\" Zeigler Jr. (born July 25, 1945)[3] was convicted of the quadruple murder of his wife, Eunice Zeigler, and her parents, Perry and Virginia Edwards, as well as a customer named Charlie Mays. \nOn December 24, 1975, at Zeigler\u2019s furniture store in Winter Garden, Florida, somebody fired approximately 30 bullets. Eunice Zeigler and Virginia Edwards were shot and killed. Perry Edwards and Charlie Mays were beaten to death with a metal crank. Police later found the crank and five guns at the murder scene.[4]\nTommy Zeigler was also shot and wounded in the abdomen. Prosecutors later theorized he shot himself in an attempt to make it look like Mays and two other men (Edward Williams and Felton Thomas) committed the murders while robbing the furniture store.[1] Williams and Thomas eventually testified against Zeigler.\nA few days after the shootings, while he was in the hospital, Zeigler was arrested and charged with the murders. According to the prosecution, Zeigler's motive for the murders was to collect the money from two life insurance policies which were taken out on his wife months before the murders. These policies were worth a total of $500,000. \nZeigler has always said that he was a victim of a bad robbery attempt. He has also maintained that Charlie Mays was involved in this robbery.[5] As recently as 2015, Zeigler has also said that his brother-in-law, Perry Edwards, Jr., was the person who planned the murders.[6]\nDue to publicity, Zeigler\u2019s trial was moved to Jacksonville, Florida.[7] A jury found him guilty. He was given the death penalty for the murders of his wife and Mays. He was also sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders of his wife's parents.\nThe case against Zeigler, and his trial, has been the subject of criticism by many, including civil rights activist Bianca Jagger, and a juror who voted to convict Zeigler.[8][5] Among the criticized points was the judge who oversaw the trial, Maurice M. Paul; months before the murders, both Zeigler and Judge Paul testified in an unrelated case on opposing sides.[7] Although the jury at Zeigler's trial recommended life imprisonment, Judge Paul instead sentenced Zeigler to death.[5]\nAt Zeigler's trial, one of the key eyewitnesses for the prosecution, Felton Thomas, testified that on the night of the murders, he, Zeigler, and Charlie Mays drove to an orange grove to fire some guns. The prosecution believed that this was a plan from Zeigler to get their fingerprints on the guns. In 2013, however, Felton Thomas recanted parts of his testimony.[9]\n",

        "paragraph": "Matthew Bryan Deitsch (born October 4, 1997) is an American writer, gun violence prevention advocate and political advisor. Before entering politics, he worked in broadcast media and was a freelance photographer, film director and music producer. After the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in which his siblings witnessed, Deitsch became chief strategist for the March For Our Lives protests and began advocating for gun violence prevention. He is the older brother of activist Ryan Deitsch.\nMatthew Bryan Deitsch[1] was born on October 4, 1997,[2][3] and grew up in Parkland, Florida. He is the older brother of activists Sam and Ryan Deitsch[4] and is a practicing Jew.[5] He attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School from 2012 until he graduated in 2016.[6] During his high school career, Deitsch was into television production and filmmaking.[7] After graduating from high school, he moved to the Los Angeles metropolitan area and attended Santa Monica College,[8][9] graduating with honors in 2017 with an associate of arts degree.[1] During his career at Santa Monica College, Deitsch entered his early political career and organized for environmental causes, including beach cleanup, with his biology class.[7] In a podcast interview hosted by CommonAlly, Deitsch credited taking a black feminism class with helping him become more educated about current affairs and politics in turn helping him participate in community organizing.[7] After attending community college, he transferred to California State University, Northridge.[10] Deitsch dropped out of Cal State Northridge after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[11] He graduated from The New School in 2020 with a bachelor's degree.[12]\nAccording to his LinkedIn profile, Deitsch started his early career as a freelance music producer as early as 2011, producing instrumental music for R&B and hip-hop artists with Audacity.[13] During his high school career, he worked in filmmaking and was an assistant director for a 2016 film titled B.F.F. produced by RinkyDink Productions in the West Palm Beach, Florida area.[14] Deitsch also co-created promotional videos for the city government of Parkland, Florida, throughout high school[15] and was an intern for television channel HBO in New York City after graduating. After moving to the Los Angeles metropolitan area to attend college, he became a photographer for VICE Media and was a brand ambassador for Toms Shoes.[13]\nWhile visiting his family on a college break in Parkland, Deitsch's sister Sam Deitsch and brother Ryan were attending Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, his alma mater; a freshman and senior, respectively. His siblings were at the school during the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018 while his brother filmed from inside the school.[16] Deitsch was buying cake for his sister because it was her birthday that day when he received a call from his mother saying there was an incident at the school.[17] After the shooting, Deitsch, along with his siblings, X Gonzalez and David Hogg, brainstormed to come with a grassroots platform which eventually became March For Our Lives and Never Again MSD, the former in which he became director of strategy and ran day-to-day operations with Jaclyn Corin.[18]\nSince then, Deitsch has dedicated his time to work on gun control advocacy in his own right and on behalf of Never Again MSD. In November 2018, he travelled to Cape Town, South Africa, to accept the International Children's Peace Prize on behalf of March For Our Lives,[19] along with his brother, Gonzalez, Hogg and Corin.[20] He appeared on Good Morning America and The Daily Show with Trevor Noah to talk about gun violence[21][22] and also co-authored a book with March For Our Lives titled Glimmer of Hope: How Tragedy Sparked a Movement in October 2018.[23] Deitsch appeared in the 2020 documentary film Parkland Rising about the shooting and subsequent student activism.[24]\nIn 2020, Deitsch joined Bernie Sanders's campaign for president of the United States as a gun violence prevention advisor and helped develop a gun violence prevention platform for the campaign.[25] In an announcement, he commented: \"America's gun violence epidemic is a public health crisis that requires dedicated organizing. The Military Industrial Complex has tainted our health across America and abroad, I am proud of Senator Sanders' growth and commitment to ending gun violence, and we won't win this fight for all of our safety unless we organize at a historic level. And that's what we are setting out to do with this effort.\"[25]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nDaniel Harold Rolling (May 26, 1954 \u2013 October 25, 2006), known as the Gainesville Ripper, was an American serial killer. He murdered five students in Gainesville, Florida, over four days in August 1990. Rolling later confessed to raping several of his victims, also committing a triple homicide in his home city of Shreveport, Louisiana, and attempting to murder his father in May 1990. In total, Rolling confessed to killing eight people.[1] He was sentenced to death for the five Gainesville murders in 1994. He was executed by lethal injection in 2006.\nDanny Rolling was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. His father was a Shreveport police officer named James Rolling, who told Danny that he was unwanted from birth. James also abused and beat Danny, Danny's mother Claudia, and his brother Kevin for frivolous things, such as breathing in a way that displeased him. In one incident, Danny's mother went to the hospital after claiming her husband tried to make her cut herself with a razor blade. She made repeated attempts to leave her husband, but always returned shortly. In one example of the senior Rolling's sense of discipline, he pinned Danny to the ground and handcuffed him, then had police take his son away because he was embarrassed by him.[2] In another story, Danny had a dog, but James beat the dog so often that it died in Danny's arms.[3]\nAs a teenager and young adult, Rolling was arrested several times for robberies in Georgia, and was caught spying on a woman getting dressed. As an adult, he had trouble trying to assimilate into society and hold down a steady job. At one point, Rolling worked as a waiter at Pancho's restaurant in Shreveport.\nIn August 1990, Rolling murdered five students (one student from Santa Fe College, and four from the University of Florida) during a burglary and robbery spree in Gainesville, Florida. He mutilated his victims' bodies, decapitating one. He then posed them, sometimes using mirrors.\nIn the early morning hours of Friday, August 24, Rolling broke into the apartment shared by 17-year-old university freshmen Sonja Larson and Christina Powell. Finding Powell asleep on the downstairs couch, he stood over her briefly but did not wake her up, choosing instead to explore the upstairs bedroom where Larson was also asleep. Rolling murdered Larson, first taping her mouth shut to stifle her screams, and then stabbing her to death with a Ka-Bar knife. She died trying to fend him off.[4]\nRolling then went back downstairs, taped Powell's mouth shut, bound her wrists together behind her back and threatened her with the knife as he cut her clothes off. He then raped her and forced her face-down onto the floor, where he stabbed her five times in the back. Rolling posed the bodies in sexually provocative positions. He took a shower before leaving the apartment.[4]\nA day later, on Saturday, August 25, Rolling broke into the apartment of 18-year-old Christa Hoyt, prying open a sliding glass door with a screwdriver. Finding she was not home, he waited in the living room for her to return. At 11 a.m., Hoyt entered the apartment and Rolling surprised her from behind, placing her in a chokehold. After she had been subdued, he used duct tape to gag her mouth and bind her wrists together behind her back and led her into the bedroom, where he cut the clothes from her body and raped her. As in the Powell murder, he forced her to lie face-down onto the bed and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her aorta. He then flipped her body over and sliced her abdomen open from her pubic bone to her breastbone. After arriving back at his campsite, Rolling could not find his wallet. Thinking he may have lost it at the murder scene, he returned there, at which time he decapitated Hoyt, posed her body in a sitting position at the edge of her bed and placed her head on a shelf facing the corpse. He later claimed his intent was to add to the shock of whoever discovered her.[4]\nBy this point, the murders had attracted widespread media attention. Many students had begun taking extra precautions, such as changing their daily routines and sleeping together in groups. Because the spree was happening so early in the fall semester, some students withdrew their enrollment or transferred to other schools. Tracy Paules, who was 23 years old, was living with her roommate Manny Taboada, also 23. On Monday, August 27, Rolling broke into their apartment by prying open their sliding glass door with the same tools he had used previously. Rolling found Taboada asleep in one of the bedrooms, and killed him after a struggle.[4]\n",

Wuornos claimed that her clients had either raped or attempted to rape her, and that all of the homicides were committed in self-defense. Wuornos was sentenced to death for six of the murders and on October 9, 2002, after 12 years on Florida's death row,[5] was executed by lethal injection.\nIn the biographical film Monster (2003), Wuornos' story is described from her first murder until her execution. For her portrayal of Wuornos, Charlize Theron won the Academy Award for Best Actress.[6]\nWuornos was born Aileen Carol Pittman in Rochester, Michigan,[7] on February 29, 1956. Her mother, Diane Wuornos (born 1939), was 14 years old when she married Aileen's father, 18-year-old Leo Dale Pittman (1936\u20131969), on June 3, 1954.[8] On March 14, 1955, Diane gave birth to Aileen's older brother Keith.[9] After less than two years of marriage, and two months before Aileen was born, Diane filed for divorce.[10][8] She gave birth to Aileen at the age of 16.[11]\nWuornos never met her father, as he was incarcerated at the time of her birth.[12] Leo Dale Pittman was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was later sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and raping a 7-year-old girl;[13][14] he committed suicide by hanging in prison on January 30, 1969.[1][2] In January 1960, when Wuornos was almost four years old, Diane abandoned her children, leaving them with their maternal grandparents, Lauri and Britta Wuornos, both alcoholics,[15] who legally adopted Keith and Aileen on March 18, 1960.[2][16] \nBy the age of 11, Wuornos began engaging in sexual activities in school in exchange for cigarettes, drugs, and food.[17] She had also engaged in sexual activities with her brother.[18] Wuornos said that her alcoholic grandfather had sexually assaulted and beaten her when she was a child. Before beating her, he would force her to strip out of her clothes.[19] In 1970, at age 14, she became pregnant,[12] having been raped by a friend of her grandfather.[19]\nWuornos gave birth to a boy at a home for unwed mothers on March 23, 1971, and the child was placed for adoption.[2] A few months after her son was born, she dropped out of school[19] at about the same time that her grandmother died of liver failure. When Wuornos was 15, her grandfather threw her out of the house, and she began supporting herself through prostitution and living in the woods near her old home.[2]\nOn May 27, 1974, at age 18, Wuornos was arrested in Jefferson County, Colorado, for driving under the influence (DUI), disorderly conduct, and firing a .22-caliber pistol from a moving vehicle. She was later charged with failure to appear.[20]\nIn 1976, Wuornos hitchhiked to Florida, where she met 69-year-old yacht club president Lewis Gratz Fell. They married quickly and the announcement of their nuptials was printed in the local newspaper's society pages. Wuornos continually involved herself in confrontations at their local bar and went to jail briefly for assault. She also hit Fell with his own cane, leading him to gain a restraining order against her within weeks of the marriage. She returned to Michigan[21][22] where, on July 14, 1976, she was arrested at Bernie's Club,[23] in Mancelona, in Antrim County and charged with assault and disturbing the peace for throwing a cue ball at a bartender's head.[24]\nOn July 17, her brother Keith died of esophageal cancer and Wuornos received $10,000 from his life insurance. Wuornos and Fell annulled their marriage on July 21 after only nine weeks.[25] In August 1976, Wuornos was given a $105 fine for drunk driving. She used the money inherited from her brother to pay the fine and spent the rest within two months buying luxuries including a new car, which she wrecked shortly afterwards.[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe \"Baby Lollipops\" murder was the murder in 1990 of three-year-old Lazaro Figueroa by his mother Ana Maria Cardona, in Florida. The body of Lazaro was found abandoned, and identified through house-to-house inquiries. The case was widely covered in US media, who called the initially unidentified boy \"Baby Lollipops\", after the design on the T-shirt he was wearing when found.\nCardona was arrested for the murder and sentenced to death; her girlfriend, Olivia Gonzalez, was sentenced to forty years. On a second appeal Cardona was sentenced to life in prison. Gonzalez was released after 14 years.\nLazaro Figueroa was born on September 18, 1987, to Ana Maria Cardona and Fidel Figueroa. Cardona also had two older children.[1] Fidel Figueroa was a well-known drug dealer and died under mysterious circumstances on September 20, 1987. This crime remains unsolved.[2]\nIn November 1990, Lazaro Figueroa's body was discovered in front of a beach property in Miami Beach. He had been severely battered, which made it initially very difficult for authorities to identify him. Because Lazaro's remains were unidentified for weeks after his discovery, local news outlets nicknamed him \"Baby Lollipops\" in reference to the shirt he was found wearing.[3]  The cause of death was later determined to be a blow to the head from a baseball bat.[4] Trial evidence showed that shortly after leaving Lazaro's body in the bushes, Cardona and her lover, Olivia Gonzalez, fled to Central Florida, even making a stop at Disney World.[5]\nDespite claims by neighbors and other individuals that Cardona was abusive towards Lazaro, she consistently denied it. Her main defense was that it was Olivia Gonzalez who had beaten Lazaro and delivered the fatal blow with a baseball bat. Cardona attested that she wanted to escape the pain of her son's horrible beatings at her girlfriend's hands and so sank into cocaine use to cope. To support claims on the influence of her past in the case, her defense presented the court with evidence pertaining to her unsettled Cuban upbringing and the psychological devastation caused by the death of Lazaro's father.[6] According to prosecutor Reid Rubin, however, Cardona was \"angry and spiteful\" from the death of her wealthy husband as she had lost a luxurious lifestyle.[5]\nGonzalez, however, was able to state her case against Cardona in exchange for a lighter 40-year sentence on the count of second-degree murder. She served 14 years.[5] While admitting she played a role in her girlfriend's abuse of Lazaro, she was able to lay the majority of the blame on Cardona for Lazaro's eventual death.\nEmployees for the Florida Power & Light Company discovered Lazaro Figueroa's dead body on the morning of November 2, 1990, at Miami Beach, hidden beneath some bushes. The boy was so emaciated that he appeared skeletal, with a bruised right eye. He wore blue gym shorts over a soiled diaper wrapped multiple times with brown packaging tape. At the time of his murder, Lazaro's weight was 18 pounds (8.16\u00a0kg), half the weight of a healthy child his age. The t-shirt he was wearing caused the Miami Beach Police Department to name him \"Baby Lollipops,\" and he remained unidentified for weeks after his discovery.[7]\nThe Miami Beach Police Department hosted a media conference with multiple detectives handling the murder case. They also conducted door-to-door interviews in both English and Spanish to obtain more information about the boy. They received numerous leads and were eventually[when?] able to identify the boy as Lazaro Figueroa, son of Ana Maria Cardona and the late Fidel Figueroa .\n",

He was also a suspected leader of the Boricua Popular Army, also known as the Los Macheteros.[3]\nNieves married in high school and dropped out in his third year. When he was 17, he was arrested for possessing heroin. When Nieves was 24, he shot and wounded a police officer during an armed robbery. He was sentenced to 5 to 8 years in prison.[4]\nIn July 1978, Nieves killed the director of a drug rehabilitation center, stabbing him 19 times while he was sleeping.[5] He was found guilty of second degree murder and sentenced to 10 to 15 years in prison. In 1979, Nieves escaped from the R\u00edo Piedras State Penitentiary, nearly beating a guard to death in the process. He then fled to Florida.[6]\nOn 29 December 1979, Nieves and two friends, Angel Toro and another man who was never caught, robbed the Velvet Swing Lounge, a strip club in Florida. During the robbery, Joseph Nagy, the manager, was shot to death. There were no eyewitnesses because most of the employees and patrons were locked in a public restroom.[1]\nPolice also suspect Nieves and Toro of committing another murder in Miami.[1]\nIn February 1981, Nieves was arrested on unrelated assault and firearms charges. He gave them a fake name, Emilio Baez, and posted bail. Before police discovered his identity, Nieves jumped bail and fled north to Connecticut. He was later arrested on federal firearm charges in Middletown, Connecticut. While awaiting trial, Nieves was sent to Hartford Correctional Center.[4] In August 1981, he and three other inmates escaped by holding one guard at knifepoint and beating another guard.[6] He was convicted in federal court of illegally possessing a firearm and second degree kidnapping in state court. Nieves was also convicted of a state firearm charge, after officials found a loaded 38-caliber Derringer revolver in his cell.[7] His federal conviction was later overturned under a now closed loophole due to Puerto Rico not being a state.[8]\nNieves and Toro, the latter now serving life without parole for murdering a woman in Massachusetts, were charged with killing Nagy in 1983, after Nieves' girlfriend at the time told police that Nieves was involved.[9] Police found Nieves' fingerprint on a matchbook left at the scene. In 1986, Diaz was found guilty of first degree murder. During his trial, he threatened witnesses, fired his lawyer, and chose to represent himself. Diaz claimed that Toro had committed the murder. The jury sentenced him to death by an 8\u20134 vote.[1][10]\n",

Calyx had told investigators that Schenecker had \"hit her with an open hand on her face for approximately 30 seconds\", according to the report.[6]\nOn January 28, 2011, police visited the property after receiving a call from Schenecker's mother, who expressed concern at not being able to reach her daughter.[5] Officers found Beau Schenecker in a sport utility vehicle in the garage and Calyx Schenecker in her bedroom; both had been shot with a .38 revolver and covered with blankets.[7] Julie Schenecker was found unconscious on the rear porch covered in blood.[8]\nPolice stated that Schenecker admitted to killing her children because they \"talked back and were mouthy\".[8] A police statement said, \"She described the crimes in detail.\"[8] A note was allegedly found in the house describing a plan to murder her children and commit suicide.[4] According to the arrest affidavit, Beau was shot twice in the head on January 27 while being driven by his mother from soccer practice.[9] Schenecker then drove home and killed Calyx in her room as she was doing her homework on her computer.[5][10] The revolver had been purchased five days before the killings.[8] Calyx was found on her bed covered by a blanket.[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nPublix Super Markets, Inc., commonly known as Publix, is an employee-owned American supermarket chain headquartered in Lakeland, Florida.[1] Founded in 1930 by George W. Jenkins, Publix is a private corporation that is wholly owned by present and past employees and members of the Jenkins family.[5] Publix operates throughout the Southeastern United States, with locations in Florida\u00a0(836), Georgia\u00a0(197), Alabama\u00a0(83), South Carolina\u00a0(66), Tennessee\u00a0(53), North Carolina\u00a0(51), and Virginia (19).[1]\nPublix maintains 1,307 store locations across the Southeast. As of December 2022, Florida has the largest number of stores, with 836, representing about 65.8% of total locations.[1] As of September 2022, Publix employs about 230,000 people[6] at its 1,305 retail locations, cooking schools, corporate offices, nine grocery distribution centers, and eleven manufacturing facilities. The manufacturing facilities produce its dairy, deli, bakery, and other food products.[1]  Publix is the largest employee-owned company in the United States.[7][8]\nGeorge Jenkins previously worked as a stock clerk and a manager at Piggly Wiggly from 1926 to 1930.[10] When Jenkins decided to open his own grocery store, he adopted the name \"Publix\" from a struggling New York-based movie theater company (with 19 opulently decorated movie houses in Florida) called Publix Theatres Corporation. Jenkins stated \u201cMost of the theaters were closing up, and I liked the sound of the name, so I just took it for my store.\u201d[11] Jenkins opened the first Publix Food Store in Winter Haven, Florida, on September 6, 1930, a 3,000 square foot building located at 58 Northwest 4th Street.[12][13] In 1934, that store made $120,000 in sales. In 1935, he opened a second market, the Economy Food Store, also in Winter Haven. Despite the Great Depression, his stores were financially successful.\nIn 1940, Jenkins, called \"Mr. George\" by his employees, mortgaged an orange grove to build Florida's first supermarket. On November 8, 1940,[12] his \"food palace\" opened at 199 West Central Avenue,[14] having piped-in music, air conditioning, cold cases for frozen and refrigerated items, in-store doughnut and flower shops, and electric-eye automatic doors. During World War II, material shortages prevented him from building additional stores. In 1945, Jenkins purchased the 19-store All American chain of food stores and converted them into Publix Super Markets.[15]\nIn 1951, Publix moved its headquarters from Winter Haven to Lakeland, Florida, and built its first distribution warehouse there. At the same time, they began to close the All American stores, replacing them with Publix markets. In 1956, Publix achieved $50 million in sales, and $1 million in profit. In 1957, the donut shop in each store was expanded into a full-service bakery.[16]\nBy 1959, Publix was the dominant supermarket chain in Central Florida, and began expansion to South Florida, opening a store in Miami and acquiring six stores from Grand Union.[17] In 1963, the company built a distribution center in Miami, and began providing deli services. In 1970, sales surpassed $500 million; they reached $1 billion in 1974, when the chain expanded to include Jacksonville, Florida.[18]\nIn 1982, the company launched the Presto! ATM network; it soon installed ATMs in every Publix. Sales exceeded $5 billion in 1989.[19]\nIn 1983, Carol Jenkins Barnett joined the Publix Board of Directors and served in that role until 2016. During her time at Publix, the company grew into the largest supermarket chain in Florida, and expanded into five other states.[20]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nTheodore Robert Bundy (born Cowell; November 24, 1946\u00a0\u2013 January 24, 1989) was an American serial killer who kidnapped, raped and murdered numerous young women and girls during the 1970s and possibly earlier. After more than a decade of denials, he confessed to 30 murders committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. His true victim total is unknown and likely significantly higher.[6]\nBundy was often regarded as charismatic and handsome, traits he exploited to win the trust of both his victims and society as a whole. He would typically approach his victims in public places, either feigning a physical impairment such as an injury, or impersonating an authority figure, before bludgeoning them into unconsciousness and taking them to secondary locations to be raped and strangled. Bundy often revisited his victims, grooming and performing sexual acts with the corpses until decomposition and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. At least twelve of his victims were decapitated and their severed heads kept as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, he broke into homes at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.\nIn 1975, Bundy was arrested and jailed in Utah for aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault. He then became a suspect in a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in several states. Facing murder charges in Colorado, Bundy engineered two dramatic escapes and committed further assaults in Florida, including three murders, before his ultimate recapture in 1978. For the Florida homicides, he received three death sentences in two trials. Bundy was executed at Florida State Prison in Raiford on January 24, 1989.\nBiographer Ann Rule characterized him as \"a sadistic sociopath who took pleasure from another human's pain and the control he had over his victims, to the point of death and even after.\"[7] Bundy once described himself as \"the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you'll ever meet,\"[8][9] a statement with which attorney Polly Nelson, a member of his last defense team, agreed. \"Ted,\" she wrote, \"was the very definition of heartless evil.\"[10]\nTed Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell on November 24, 1946, to Eleanor Louise Cowell (1924\u20132012, known by her middle name) at the Elizabeth Lund Home for Unwed Mothers[11] in Burlington, Vermont. His biological father's identity has never been confirmed; his original birth certificate apparently assigns paternity to a salesman and United States Air Force veteran named Lloyd Marshall,[12] though a copy of it listed his father as unknown.[13] Louise claimed she met a war veteran named Jack Worthington,[14] who abandoned her soon after she became pregnant.[15] Census records reveal that several men by the name of \"John Worthington\" and \"Lloyd Marshall\" lived near Louise when Bundy was conceived.[16] Some family members expressed suspicions that Bundy might have been fathered by Louise's own father, Samuel Cowell.[17] In the 2020 documentary film Crazy, Not Insane, psychiatrist Dorothy Otnow Lewis claimed she received a sample of Bundy's blood\u2014though she did not specify from where\u2014and had arranged a DNA test which confirmed that Bundy was not the product of incest.[18]\nFor the first three years of his life, Bundy lived in the Philadelphia home of his maternal grandparents, Samuel (1898\u20131983) and Eleanor Cowell (1895\u20131971), who raised him as their son to avoid the social stigma that accompanied birth outside of wedlock at that time. Family, friends, and even young Ted were told that his grandparents were his parents and that his mother was his older sister. Bundy eventually discovered the truth, although his recollections of the circumstances varied; he told a girlfriend that a cousin showed him a copy of his birth certificate after calling him a \"bastard,\"[19] but he told biographers Stephen Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth that he had found the certificate himself.[13] Biographer and true crime writer Ann Rule, who knew Bundy personally, wrote that he did not find out until 1969, when he located his original birth record in Vermont.[20] Bundy expressed a lifelong resentment toward his mother for never talking to him about his real father, and for leaving him to discover his true parentage for himself.[21]\nBundy occasionally exhibited disturbing behavior at an early age. Louise's younger sister Julia recalled awakening from a nap to find herself surrounded by knives from the kitchen, and three-year-old Ted standing by the bed, smiling.[22] Bundy's childhood neighbor Sandi Holt described him as a bully, saying, \"He liked to terrify people... He liked to be in charge. He liked to inflict pain and suffering and fear.\"[23]\nIn some interviews, Bundy spoke warmly of his grandparents[24] and told Rule that he \"identified with,\" \"respected,\" and \"clung to\" his grandfather.[25] In 1987, however, he and other family members told attorneys that Samuel was a tyrannical bully who beat his wife and dog, exhibited bigotry (including religious intolerance, racism, and xenophobia), and swung neighborhood cats by their tails. In one instance, Samuel threw Julia down a flight of stairs for oversleeping.[26] He sometimes spoke aloud to unseen presences,[27] and at least once flew into a violent rage when the question of Bundy's paternity was raised.[26] Bundy described his grandmother as a timid and obedient woman who periodically underwent electroconvulsive therapy for depression[27] and feared to leave their house toward the end of her life.[28] These descriptions of Bundy's grandparents have been questioned in more recent investigations. Some locals remembered Samuel Cowell as a \"fine man\", if a bit eccentric. A cousin of Bundy claimed that the negative characterizations of Samuel Cowell likely arose to explain why his grandson became a serial killer. In addition, Louise's sister Audrey stated that their mother couldn't leave her home because she suffered a stroke due to being overweight and was not mentally ill.[29]\n",

Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes tied to a concrete block around their necks. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted billboards bearing enlarged images of the suspect's handwriting recovered from a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting.\nPrior to his arrest, Chandler worked as an unlicensed aluminum-siding contractor. Against the advice of his attorneys, he testified in his own defense, saying he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions. Chandler said he never saw them again, except in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution. During his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he did not have a single visitor.\nChandler was executed on November 15, 2011. He wrote a last statement to prison officials: \"You are killing a [sic] innocent man today\". The statement was read at a post-execution news conference. In February 2014, DNA evidence identified Chandler as the murderer of Ivelisse Berrios-Beguerisse, who was found dead in Coral Springs, Florida, on November 27, 1990.\nChandler was the fourth of five children born to Oba Chandler Sr. and Margaret Johnson, and was raised in Cincinnati, Ohio.[1] When he was ten\u00a0years old in June 1957, his father hanged himself in the basement of the family's apartment.[1] At the funeral, Chandler jumped into his father's open grave as the gravediggers were covering the coffin with dirt.[1][2] Between May and September 1991\u200d\u2014\u200cconcurrent with the police investigation of the Rogers family triple murder\u200d\u2014\u200cChandler was an informant for the U.S. Customs Bureau's Tampa office.[2][3]\nWhen Chandler was fourteen, he began stealing cars and was arrested twenty times as a juvenile.[1] As an adult, he was charged with a variety of crimes, including possession of counterfeit money, loitering, burglary, kidnapping, and armed robbery.[4] He was also accused of masturbating while peeping through a woman's window. In one incident, Chandler and an accomplice broke into a Florida couple's home, held them at gunpoint, and robbed them. Chandler told his accomplice to tie up the man with speaker wire and took the woman into the bedroom, where he made her strip to her underwear, tied her up, and rubbed the barrel of his revolver across her stomach.[2]\nOn May 26, 1989, Joan \"Jo\" Rogers, 36, and her daughters\u200d\u2014\u200cMichelle, 17, and Christe, 14\u200d\u2014\u200cleft their family dairy farm in Willshire, Ohio, for a vacation in Florida.[5][6] It was the first time they had left their home state. Authorities believe Joan became lost on June 1 during the return drive from Orlando to Willshire, and had decided to take an extra vacation day in Tampa.[7] While looking for their hotel they encountered Chandler, who gave them directions and offered to meet them again later to take them on a sunset cruise of Tampa Bay.[1] Joan and her teenage daughters had left Orlando around 9:00\u00a0a.m.[8] and checked into the Days Inn on Route 60 at 12:30\u00a0p.m.[9]\nPhotographs retrieved from a roll of film found in a camera in the Rogers' hotel room showed Michelle sitting on the floor. The last photograph was taken from the hotel balcony and showed the sun beginning to set over Tampa Bay, confirming that all three family members were alive and had not left their hotel room as the sunset began.[10] They were last seen alive at the hotel's restaurant at around 7:30\u00a0p.m. It is believed they boarded Chandler's boat by the dock on the Courtney Campbell Causeway\u2014part of Route 60\u2014between 8:30\u00a0p.m. and 9:00\u00a0p.m., and that they were dead by 3\u00a0a.m. the next day.[11] Chandler may have used the fact that he was born in Ohio to lure them into feeling a connection to him.[12] Chandler knew Joan and her daughters were not from Florida because he saw the Ohio license plates on their car.[13][14]\nThe victims' bodies were found floating in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989.[15] The first body was found when several people on board a sailboat crossing under the Sunshine Skyway saw an object in the water.[16] The second body was seen floating off the pier in St. Petersburg, two miles (3\u00a0km) north of the first. While the Coast Guard were recovering the second body, a call about a third, which was seen floating 200 yards (200\u00a0m) to the east, was received.

        "paragraph": "\nThe 2016 United States House of Representatives sit-in began on June 22, 2016, when members of the House Democratic Caucus, led by Georgia Representative John Lewis, Massachusetts Representative Katherine Clark, and Illinois Representative Robin Kelly, declared their intention to remain on the floor of the United States House of Representatives until its Republican Speaker, Paul Ryan, allowed votes on gun control legislation in the aftermath of the June 12, 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. The sit-in was staged by about 60 legislators.[a] Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and Hillary Clinton showed their support via Twitter.[4][5][6]\nThe sit-in, which was quickly organized and caught House Republicans off-guard, resulted in the Speaker pro tempore, Dan Webster, ordering the House into recess, with the cameras which provide video coverage of the chamber's daily proceedings to news networks including C-SPAN consequently shut off. Democrats refused to leave the floor during this recess and instead gave speeches, streamed online to over a million individuals via Periscope and Facebook, demanding Congressional action to combat gun violence.[7]\nThe House was reconvened by Ryan later on June 22 at 10:00\u00a0p.m. to consider a presidential veto message, and again at 2:30\u00a0a.m. on June 23 to vote on a bill to fund the Department of Veterans Affairs, military construction, and the country's response to the outbreak of the Zika virus, both times to chaotic scenes in the chamber. The House was then adjourned until July 5, without having taken action on any of the measures demanded by Democrats.[8] Despite this, many Democrats insisted they would remain on the floor regardless, with California congresswoman Maxine Waters saying she would remain in place \"until hell freezes over\".[9]\nA group of Democrats ultimately occupied the floor through the night, only leaving on the afternoon of June 23, with Lewis as the last speaker before the sit-in's conclusion. None of the measures demanded by the occupying members were given a vote, but Democrats insisted that they would continue to pursue gun control legislation.[10]\nHouse Democrats had long sought to bring gun control legislation to the floor of the House, and this desire was reinvigorated in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub shooting, which had left 49 dead. The use of a discharge petition to force a vote was being considered by the chamber's Democratic leadership, but was not pursued due to the lengthy process involved, and a doubt that it would be able to obtain the requisite majority of 218 signatures from members of the House.[11]\nOn June 19, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi asked outgoing congressman Steve Israel to provide her with an alternative list of ways in which Democrats could force the issue in the House.[11] Incidentally, the next day, on June 20, four gun control measures failed to pass in the United States Senate.[12]\nThis resulted in a June 21 attempt by Assistant Democratic Leader Jim Clyburn to force action through a motion to recommit, and the adoption of a \"No Bill, No Break\" mantra, which was soon shouted by Democratic members on the floor of the House, and became a popular hashtag on Twitter. Concurrent to the leadership's efforts, a group of \"12 to 15\" Democratic backbenchers, led by Massachusetts congresswoman Katherine Clark, and with significant assistance from Connecticut's John Larson, convened in Clark's office on the night of June 21, with the goal of ensuring the House \"couldn't proceed\" until a vote was held. The plot was soon uncovered by party leadership, which endorsed their plan in principle, but advised the plotters to \"go big\" and to select a significant figure as the face of their activity.[11]\nClark and Larson then asked Georgia congressman John Lewis, the Democrats' longtime Senior Chief Deputy Whip and a veteran of many sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement, to act as their leader. Lewis accepted, and hosted a final meeting with the plotters in his office late on June 21.[11]\n",

The two had originally met at an Ybor City, Florida nightclub in November 2001 where Humphrey worked as a doorman and Sandee was a bartender.[2] Humphrey had a long previous criminal record of convictions for motor vehicle theft, kidnapping and aggravated assault.[1] The following February, Humphrey was arrested for felony battery after allegedly beating and sexually assaulting Sandee. He was due to go to trial on that charge on August 4, 2003, one month after Sandee's murder.[2]\nAshley Christine Humphrey (n\u00e9e Laney; born October 13, 1982)[3] was working at Planet Smoothie in Brandon, Florida when she met Tracey Humphrey at a local gym in 2002.[4] Ashley and Tracey married on July 4, 2003, one day before Sandee's murder.[4]\nOn July 5, 2003, Sandee Rozzo was shot to death in the garage of her Pinellas Park, Florida townhouse after returning home from her shift at the Green Iguana, a local bar.[2] Sandee's coworker Tracey Humphrey became the prime suspect.[5] Humphrey had an alibi however, claiming that he had ordered a pizza to his Brandon, Florida apartment at the time of the crime.[6] This was verified by an acquaintance, Tobe White. Further investigation however, revealed that his wife of one day, Ashley Humphrey, was not at home during the crime, as cell phone records indicated that Ashley was actually in Pinellas Park, Florida when Sandee was killed.[7] Ashley Humphrey was arrested for the first-degree murder of Sandra Rozzo and her husband Tracey Humphrey was charged with a federal firearms possession.[2] While she was in custody, Ashley Humphrey decided to cooperate with authorities. She had admitted that she shot Sandra Rozzo to death, but claimed it was at the behest of her husband. In her statement, she told vivid details about the plot to murder Sandee. In addition, she also gave up details regarding another failed murder attempt against Sandee. In a plea bargain, Ashley was allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against her husband. This gave prosecutors enough evidence to charge Tracey Humphrey with first-degree murder.[6]\nTracey Humphrey's murder trial began in February 2006. As part of her plea deal, Ashley testified against her husband. Under oath, she testified how she waited hours for Sandee to get off work at the Green Iguana, and then followed her back to her Pinellas Park home, where she fired eight shots into her.[7]  Tracey Humphrey testified in his own defense, stating that the killing was Ashley's idea.[8] The jury did not find him convincing. He was convicted of first-degree murder on February 25, 2006.[5] Even though he faced the death penalty, jurors opted for life without parole, believing that it would be a harsher punishment than death in this case.[9]\nTracey Humphrey is serving his sentence at South Bay Correctional Facility in South Bay, Florida, Inmate Number: 930490. Post-conviction, he was sentenced to an additional 15 years for a pre-trial escape attempt in April 2004.[1]\nOn March 10, 2006, Ashley Humphrey was sentenced to 25 years for murder.[9] She is currently incarcerated at the Gadsden Correctional Facility in Quincy, Florida, Inmate Number: 154362.  She is scheduled to be released from prison on December 13, 2028; she will be 46 years old.[3]\nThis case has been profiled from various perspectives on Dateline NBC, 48 Hours, Vengeance: Killer Lovers, Snapped, and On the Case with Paula Zahn; Ashley was interviewed by FBI profiler Candice DeLong for an episode of DeLong's Investigation Discovery series, Facing Evil. On 13 July 2017, Killer Woman was shown on ITV with Piers Morgan interviewing Ashley.[citation needed] Homicide: Hours to Kill, season two, episode nine, also covered the case.\n",

Britton's death was the second assassination of a Pensacola abortion provider in under a year and a half; he had replaced David Gunn after the latter's 1993 murder by another anti-abortionist.\nBorn in Boston, Britton graduated in 1949 from the University of Virginia School of Medicine, then served in the US Army stationed in Korea and also taught at the Medical College of Georgia. He then became a family physician in Fernandina Beach, Florida, spending much of his time delivering babies.[3]\nAfter Gunn's murder, Britton began flying across the state to Pensacola weekly in order to perform abortions at the Pensacola Ladies' Center. Because he had received harassment and death threats, he wore a homemade bulletproof vest, carried a .357 Magnum,[4] and enlisted volunteer bodyguards.[1]\nBritton was notably ambivalent about abortion: he viewed abortion as a last resort option, and would sometimes turn away women seeking it, telling them to think about the decision and come back in a week if they still wanted an abortion. However, he described anti-abortion protesters as \"fanatics.\"[3]\nAs Britton arrived at the clinic on July 29, 1994, Hill approached and fired at him with a twelve-gauge shotgun, hitting him in the head and killing him. Hill later stated that he aimed for Britton's head because he suspected the doctor was wearing a bulletproof vest.[1] Hill also killed Britton's bodyguard, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, James Herman Barrett Jr (August 9, 1919 \u2013 July 29, 1994),[5] and wounded Barrett's wife, June, a retired nurse. The murders resulted in several members of Congress calling for the FBI to infiltrate anti-abortion groups, as it had with the Ku Klux Klan.[4]\nHill was sentenced to death on December 6, 1994, and executed by lethal injection on September 3, 2003. He was the first person in the United States to be executed for murdering a doctor who performed abortions.\nIn a piece several months earlier in GQ, Tom Junod had profiled a number of parties involved in the murders: not only Britton, but also Hill and the Barretts.[6] Britton and Hill are also interviewed in Tony Kaye's documentary Lake of Fire, which was released in 2006.[7]\n",

Police body camera showing McDade pointing a firearm at one of the police officers before being shot was also released.[12]\nMcDade is a suspect in Jackson's fatal stabbing and police stated that McDade pointed a gun at police and that a bloody knife was found at the scene.[13] Some witnesses have contradicted statements by the Police Department[14] that McDade was armed with a gun.[8][15][6][5] The officer also allegedly called McDade the N-word before shooting and killing him.[13]\nIn 2020, McDade entered into a relationship with Jennifer Jackson, a neighbor of his who was the mother of Malik Jackson. According to her family members, McDade entered Jackson's home on May 25 and pistol-whipped her. On May 26, McDade returned to Jackson's home and allegedly became verbally abusive. This led to a physical altercation with Malik Jackson and other members of Jackson's family.[20]\nEarly on May 27, McDade went live on Facebook to recount being jumped by a group of men, which had been a one-on-one fight before an insult caused four others to join, and vowed revenge. McDade stated he had weapons and planned to fight one of the men;[21]\n\"It took five of you to kick and punch and have me on the ground in a fetal position. And I came out looking the same way I was before I went in that fetal position...But y'all know what, y'all aint gone look the same when them bullets touch your dome. And I'm posting this live...Warning comes before destruction. And I'm telling you five motherfuckers that you're going to die.\"He detailed his wounds from the altercation which included a bloody elbow and two lumps on his head. He potentially alludes to an attempted suicide by cop or gun fight with the man;[21]\n\"Just know before I kill myself through a shootout, because that's what's going to happen, because I'm [going to] pull it out and you know these officers nowadays they see a gun they just [going to] shoot....So that's what I'm pushing for, because I don't want to be here on earth dealing with the government.\"According to the Tallahassee Police Department they approached McDade on May 27, as a suspect in the fatal stabbing of Malik Jackson earlier in the day. The Department Police Chief Lawrence Revelle told reporters that; \"the suspect was in possession of a handgun, and a bloody knife was found at the scene\" and that McDade had pointed a gun at the responding officer.[13] The officer reported this information over the department's radio frequency.[22]\nWitnesses have disputed this, claiming that officers said \"Stop moving, nigger!\" and then shot McDade after he stopped moving. The witnesses also claim that officers never identified themselves or told McDade initially to stop his actions.[13]\n",

Partin was sentenced to death by a 9\u20133 vote in favor of the sentence by a jury on December 1, 2008, for the July 31, 2002 murder of 16-year-old hitchhiker Joshan Ashbrook.[4][5]\nEvidence at Partin's trial showed that he picked up Ashbrook as she hitchhiked along U.S. Highway 19 in Florida on July 31, 2002. He and Ashbrook spent the day fishing and swimming with Partin's daughter, then 6, before returning to the New Port Richey house where he and his daughter were living. Prosecutors think Ashbrook was killed between 9 p.m. and midnight. The next morning, workers found her body in woods off Shady Hills Road. She had been strangled, her throat gashed and her neck broken. Nine days after the discovery, Partin dropped his daughter off at the home of a foster mother, Jean Prestridge, later known as Jean Edenfield, in Wauchula and left the state. His daughter Patrisha's two sisters lived with this foster mother in her Wauchula home. Jean kept Patrisha for five days but then gave her up to foster care.[6] He was a fugitive for more than a year before investigators tracked him to Fayetteville, North Carolina. He was arrested there on October 28, 2003.\nPartin was a prostitute with male clients. Partin was convicted of second-degree murder in Florida after he killed one of his clients, Gary Thorne, a math teacher from Key Biscayne.[7] Thorne was strangled with a telephone cord in his home. He was convicted of second-degree murder, armed robbery and armed burglary in 1989 and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Partin was released from prison on August 1, 1995. He then worked in construction and had a daughter, Patrisha Windham (born c. 1996), with Martha Windham.[8][9] He had sole custody of his daughter prior to Ashbrook's death.[10]\n\nThis crime-related article is a stub.

One of the most infamous bank robbers in South Africa's history, Stander was notorious for the audacious manner with which he carried out his crimes; he sometimes carried out the crime on his lunch break, often returning to the scene as an investigating officer.[1]\nStander was portrayed by American actor Thomas Jane in the 2003 film Stander.\nThe son of a prominent figure in the South African Prison Service, Major General Francois Jacobus Stander (1916\u20132001), Andr\u00e9 was under pressure from an early age to pursue a career in law enforcement. He enrolled at the South African Police training college near Pretoria in 1963, graduating at the top of his class. Shortly afterwards he joined the Kempton Park criminal investigation department.[2]\nIn 1977, Stander flew to Durban and robbed his first bank. Between 1977 and 1980, he is believed to have stolen nearly a hundred thousand rand.[2]\nAfter robbing nearly 30 banks, Stander was arrested and sentenced to 75 years in prison on 6 May 1980.[1] However, since many of the charges in the sentence ran concurrently, he faced an actual sentence of 17 years.[3] Stander met Allan Heyl and Lee McCall at the Zonderwater maximum security prison.[1]\nAfter his first trial, Stander claimed that his disillusionment with police service stemmed from a prior incident when he and his fellow officers shot and killed 176 unarmed schoolchildren during the 1976 Soweto uprising. However, Stander was not present with the police contingent at Thembisa when the shooting of unarmed schoolchildren took place.[2]\nOther accounts have suggested that Stander, who completed his national service in Angola during the South African Border War, may have also been bored with civilian life and craved the excitement afforded by a life of crime.[4]\nOn 11 August 1983, Stander and McCall, along with five other inmates, were taken from the prison's premises for a physiotherapy appointment. Once the prisoners were left alone with the physiotherapist, Stander and McCall overpowered her and escaped. The other prisoners refused to participate and stayed behind.[5]\n",

Lunsford was abducted from her home in the early morning of February 24, 2005, by John Couey, a 46-year-old convicted sex offender who lived nearby. Couey held her captive over the weekend, during which she was raped and later murdered by being buried alive. The media extensively covered the investigation and trial of Couey.\nJessica Lunsford's murder influenced the introduction of legislation in Florida known as Jessica's Law, designed to protect potential victims and reduce a sexual offender's ability to re-offend, which has since influenced similar legislation in 42 other states.\nOn August 24, 2007, a judge in Inverness convicted Couey for the kidnapping, sexual battery, and first degree murder of Lunsford, and sentenced him to death. However, Couey died of natural causes in 2009, before his sentence could be carried out.\nNine-year-old Jessica Lunsford disappeared in the night on February 24, 2005, from her home in Homosassa, Florida. After approximately three weeks of intense searching for her around the area of her home, John Evander Couey was arrested in Savannah, Georgia, for an outstanding warrant of cannabis possession, but was released after questioning because it was only a local warrant.[1] Couey was a 46-year-old long-time resident of Homosassa with an extensive criminal record, listing dozens of arrests for burglary and was a convicted child sex offender. Due to the laws at the time, Couey received only short sentences and was not monitored after release, despite his record of being an experienced trespasser and his repeated sexual offenses against children.\nOn March 12, Couey was arrested in Augusta, Georgia, at the request of the Citrus County Sheriff's Office, for questioning about Jessica Lunsford's disappearance due to his residence on West Snowbird Court in Homosassa, only 65 yards from the Lunsford's home, and his criminal record. Couey stated he did not have anything to do with the nine-year-old's disappearance and had moved to Georgia to find a job, only knowing about it from the television news.[2] He was released from police custody after being interviewed.\nOn March 14, Couey's half-sister Dorothy Dixon gave permission to police to search her trailer at West Snowbird Court in Homosassa. Couey had lived at the West Snowbird Court residence with Dixon, her boyfriend Matt Dittrich, her daughter and son\u2013in-law, Madie and Gene Secord, and her two-year-old grandson, Joshua. During the search a blood-stained mattress and pillows were found in Couey's closet in his room, and forensic analysis discovered both Couey's and Lunsford's DNA on the mattress.[3]\nOn March 17, Couey was arrested and charged with the murder of Jessica Lunsford, and transported to the Citrus County jail in Florida.\nOn March 18, 2005, Couey made an audio-recorded and videotaped confession to having kidnapped, raped and murdered Lunsford.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "Lionel Alexander Tate (born January 30, 1987)[1] is the youngest American citizen ever sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, though this sentence was eventually overturned.[2] In January 2001, when Tate was 13, he was convicted of first-degree murder for the 1999 battering death of six-year-old Tiffany Eunick in Broward County, Florida.[3]\nOn July 28, 1999, Tate was left alone with Eunick, who was being babysat by Tate's mother, Kathleen Grossett-Tate. While the children were downstairs playing, Tate's mother called to them to be quiet. Tate came up 45 minutes later to say that Eunick was not breathing. He said that while they were wrestling, he had her in a headlock and the child's head hit a table. Only Eunick and Grossett-Tate were present when this occurred. \nTate was convicted of killing Eunick by stomping on her so forcefully that her liver was lacerated. Her legs, feet, and neck all had serious bruises; an example of the amount of force used on her was similar to bruises from that of a speeding car.[4] Her other injuries included a fractured skull, fractured rib, and swollen brain. These injuries were characterized by the prosecution as \"similar to those she would have sustained by falling from a three-story building.\"[5] In sentencing Tate to life imprisonment, Judge Joel T. Lazarus of Broward County Circuit Court said that \"The acts of Lionel Tate were not the playful acts of a child [...] The acts of Lionel Tate were cold, callous and indescribably cruel.\"[6]\nFlorida Statutes required the jury to convict Tate of first-degree murder even if the jury did not believe that he intended to kill or injure anyone\u2014all that was required was that Tate knowingly abused another child who died as a result, as any intentional act that could reasonably be expected to result in physical injury to a child is child abuse per Florida statutes.[7][8][9] The rule for such convictions is known as the felony murder rule. The sufficient conditions of the felony murder rule were listed by the judge Joel T. Lazarus during sentencing.[10] Therefore, Tate was sentenced to life in prison without the prosecution having to prove that he intended to kill or injure, or realized that his acts are likely to kill or injure, or even that a typical child of his age would or should realize this.\nCritics, such as the various groups listed in the amicus brief attached to Tate's appeal, assert that convicting preteen children of first-degree murder without having to prove these children intended any harm, not to mention serious injury or death, is unacceptable.[11][12]\nThe sentence was controversial because Tate was 12 years old at the time of the murder, and his victim was 6. He was the youngest person in modern US history to be sentenced to life imprisonment,[2] bringing broad criticism on the treatment of juvenile offenders in the justice system of the state of Florida.\nAfter the conviction, the prosecution openly joined Tate's plea for leniency in sentencing and even offered to help in his appeal. The trial judge criticized the prosecution for compromising the integrity of the adversarial system, and said that if the prosecution felt that life imprisonment was not warranted, they should not have charged him with murder in the first place.[13]\nIn January 2004, a state appeals court overturned his conviction on the basis that his mental competency had not been evaluated before trial. This opened the way for Tate to accept the same plea deal he originally turned down, and he was released on one year's house arrest and 10 years' probation.[14]\nOn May 23, 2005, Tate was charged with armed burglary with battery, armed robbery, and violation of probation, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said.[15]\n",

Kasky is a survivor of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.[4] Kasky was included in Time magazine's \"100 Most Influential People of 2018\".[5]\nKasky was a student, a \"theatre kid\", and former member of the drama club at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and was a junior at the time of the school shooting in February 2018.[6][7][8] He has a younger brother with autism who is also a survivor of the MSD shooting.[9]\nKasky had just left drama class when the shooting began at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on February 14, 2018.[10] After he met his younger brother at a different classroom and exiting the school, the fire alarm sounded. With other students, they were instructed to go back inside. They waited an hour in a classroom until they were rescued.[7]\nAfter the shooting, Kasky brought several school friends to his house and with them founded Never Again MSD (#NeverAgain), a student-led gun control advocacy group.[11] Kasky came up with the name \"Never Again\" while the group stayed up through the night to make plans, and he posted \"Stay alert. #NeverAgain\" to Facebook.[6][12][13] The group works to create a national movement against gun violence, including an effort to publicize legislators receiving money from the NRA and persuading people not to vote for them. It promoted and led a massive rally called March for Our Lives in Washington, DC, on March 24, 2018.[14]\nAccording to a report in The New Yorker, it was Kasky's idea to found the activist group along with fellow students David Hogg, X Gonz\u00e1lez, Sarah Chadwick and others\u00a0\u2013 a group described by reporter Michael Schulman as having \"moral clarity and vision\" in the gun control debate.[11] Kasky wrote an op-ed on the CNN website describing the events of the massacre and his reaction to it.[7] In an interview, Kasky told the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper that \"my generation won't stand for this.\"[7] Although known as a \"theatre kid\" with a reputation for being the class clown,[6] Kasky's experience after the shooting was primarily one of anger:[15]\nCan't sleep. Thinking about so many things. So angry that I'm not scared or nervous anymore\u00a0... I'm just angry. I just want people to understand what happened and understand that doing nothing will lead to nothing. Who'd have thought that concept was so difficult to grasp?[6]At a televised \"Stand Up\" town hall session sponsored by CNN with Senator Marco Rubio, Kasky asked the senator whether he would continue receiving money from the National Rifle Association (NRA): \"Can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?\"[16][17] Rubio responded by saying, \"I will always accept the help of anyone who agrees with my agenda.\"[16] Kasky repeatedly questioned Rubio about whether he would continue receiving NRA money. The senator did not offer a definitive response but appeared to soften his positions regarding some gun restrictions.[18]\nKasky temporarily stopped utilizing Facebook as a result of death threats.[16] When later Kasky was accused of being a crisis actor, he replied to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that \"if you had seen me in our school's production of 'Fiddler on the Roof,' you would know that nobody would pay me to act for anything.\"[19]\n",

Britton's death was the second assassination of a Pensacola abortion provider in under a year and a half; he had replaced David Gunn after the latter's 1993 murder by another anti-abortionist.\nBorn in Boston, Britton graduated in 1949 from the University of Virginia School of Medicine, then served in the US Army stationed in Korea and also taught at the Medical College of Georgia. He then became a family physician in Fernandina Beach, Florida, spending much of his time delivering babies.[3]\nAfter Gunn's murder, Britton began flying across the state to Pensacola weekly in order to perform abortions at the Pensacola Ladies' Center. Because he had received harassment and death threats, he wore a homemade bulletproof vest, carried a .357 Magnum,[4] and enlisted volunteer bodyguards.[1]\nBritton was notably ambivalent about abortion: he viewed abortion as a last resort option, and would sometimes turn away women seeking it, telling them to think about the decision and come back in a week if they still wanted an abortion. However, he described anti-abortion protesters as \"fanatics.\"[3]\nAs Britton arrived at the clinic on July 29, 1994, Hill approached and fired at him with a twelve-gauge shotgun, hitting him in the head and killing him. Hill later stated that he aimed for Britton's head because he suspected the doctor was wearing a bulletproof vest.[1] Hill also killed Britton's bodyguard, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, James Herman Barrett Jr (August 9, 1919 \u2013 July 29, 1994),[5] and wounded Barrett's wife, June, a retired nurse. The murders resulted in several members of Congress calling for the FBI to infiltrate anti-abortion groups, as it had with the Ku Klux Klan.[4]\nHill was sentenced to death on December 6, 1994, and executed by lethal injection on September 3, 2003. He was the first person in the United States to be executed for murdering a doctor who performed abortions.\nIn a piece several months earlier in GQ, Tom Junod had profiled a number of parties involved in the murders: not only Britton, but also Hill and the Barretts.[6] Britton and Hill are also interviewed in Tony Kaye's documentary Lake of Fire, which was released in 2006.[7]\n",

        "paragraph": "Jeffrey Lynn Feltner (November 21, 1962 \u2013 March 17, 1993) was an American serial killer and former nurse's aide who smothered seven patients to death from 1988 to 1989 at the hospitals he worked at. After initially confessing but later recanting his statements, he pleaded guilty to two of the murders in exchange for a 25-to-life sentence and no further charges in the other murders. A few years after his conviction, he died behind bars from AIDS complications.\nJeffrey Lynn Feltner was born on November 21, 1962, in Miami, Florida. His parents split up three months before his birth, with his father Kasper moving to Michigan while Feltner remained with his mother, Shirley.[1] The pair moved to Melrose in 1979, where Feltner attended and later graduated from the Interlachen High School. Considered a loner by most of his peers, he started spending a majority of his time visiting gay bars and similar establishments around the area. During one sexual encounter, he contracted HIV, which progressively worsened over time.[1]\nIn 1986, Feltner's mother helped him get a job at the New Life Acres nursing home in Melrose, where she worked as a nursing assistant. After only a few months on the job, he was promoted to supervising other nurses' aides and was greatly respected by both patients and staff. In 1987, Feltner temporarily quit his job for two months so he could locate his birth father, and after succeeding in doing so, he returned to Melrose and was rehired.[1]\nFrom February to April 1988, five patients died at the New Life Acres nursing home under what were assumed to be natural circumstances. In July of that same year, Feltner anonymously contacted a crisis hotline and confessed to the five killings, claiming that he had an uncontrollable impulse to end their suffering and would probably kill again.[2] These victims were the following:\nDespite these confessions and Feltner being questioned by police, no charges were brought due to a lack of evidence. In the midst of the investigation, Feltner called anonymously again and claimed he had attempted to kill another patient, but his claims were found to be contradictory and he was dismissed as a crank.[4] In order to prevent him from repeating this, he was charged and found guilty of making harassing phone calls, trespassing and filing a false report, receiving a four-month sentence at a local prison.[5]\nAfter his release on November 19, Feltner moved to Daytona Beach, where he lived in an apartment above a bar on Main Street. He soon found work at the Clyatt Memorial Center, where he was again hired as a supervisor for the nurse's aides. On July 11, 1989, 83-year-old Doris Moriarty, a longtime resident of the center, died suddenly. Her death was not considered suspicious at the time, as she had been in ill health for the past few years. A few days later, Feltner was fired for failing to show up at work, but soon found employment at the Bowman's Nursing Home in Ormond Beach.[5] On July 27, a patient living in the nursing home, 81-year-old Ruby P. Swisher, died in what was originally considered a natural death.\nOn August 9, Feltner suffered a mental breakdown and sought help from a mental health centre before calling the offices of the local WESH TV station and confessing to his crimes.[4] A day later, the administrator of the Clyatt Memorial Center, William Powell, called the police and informed them that a former employee of his had supposedly confessed to killing several patients at the places he worked at, which included Moriarty. The authorities soon arrested and charged Feltner with her murder.[5] During subsequent interrogations, he openly admitted to the crimes, exclaiming that he had done them to put his victims out of their misery. In the aftermath of this, the bodies of Abrams, Thornton and James were exhumed for testing, as the other victims' bodies had been cremated.[6]\nSoon after his arrest, he was charged with the killings and put on trial for them in January 1990. To the investigators' surprise, Feltner recanted his testimony and claimed that he falsely confessed to the killings in order to bring attention to the appalling conditions and abuse that occurred at the nursing homes.[7] This statement was supported by his parents, who voiced their belief that their son would never commit such a horrendous crime.[1]\nWhile he continued to deny the murder charges, Feltner nonetheless pleaded guilty to two of the murders in order to avoid a potential death sentence.[7] As part of the plea bargain, he would not be charged with the remaining murders and would serve a 25-years-to-life sentence at the Florida State Prison in Raiford.[2] His mother later claimed that the sole reason he confessed was that his life could end quickly, as Feltner's AIDS had been getting progressively worse despite treatment with Aztreonam.[1] As a result of this, he died on March 17, 1993.\n",

        "paragraph": "Carl Eric \"Charlie\" Brandt (February 23, 1957 \u2013 September 13, 2004) was an American serial killer who murdered at least four female victims; one in Indiana and three others in Florida. Growing up in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Brandt shot his parents in their family home on the night of January 3, 1971, when he was 13, killing his pregnant mother and wounding his father. He spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released and was never criminally charged. 33 years later, on September 13, 2004, Brandt stabbed his wife and niece to death and then hanged himself in his niece's garage. This incident, Brandt's efficiency in killing his wife and niece, and his hidden obsession with human anatomy led investigators to look into the possibility that he had committed other murders since moving to Florida in 1973. The 1989 murder of a homeless woman near Brandt's home was solved as a result of the investigation, as Brandt was found to have been the perpetrator. The police suspect him in three other Florida murders, but his true number of victims could potentially be more than 30.\nCharlie Brandt was the second child of Herbert and Ilsa Brandt, two German immigrants who originally settled in Texas before moving to Connecticut. Brandt's father worked as a laborer for a division of International Harvester, eventually working his way up to draftsman and project engineer. The family moved frequently and as a result Brandt and his older sister Angela attended several different schools.[2]\nBrandt was regarded as a good student, but was shy and had difficulty adjusting to new surroundings. In September 1968, Herbert was transferred to International Harvester's plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana. The family frequently vacationed in Florida, where Brandt hunted small game with his father.[2]\nOn the evening of January 3, 1971, after their children had turned in for the night in their Fort Wayne home, Herbert Brandt was shaving in the bathroom while Ilsa, eight months pregnant, was taking a bath. Charlie Brandt, then aged 13, abruptly walked into the bathroom and shot both parents at point blank range with his father's handgun, which he had taken from a dresser. His father survived, but his mother and the fetus were killed instantly. Brandt then entered his sister Angela's room and attempted to shoot her, but his gun would not fire.[3]\nAfter a physical struggle, Angela managed to calm her brother down by promising him that she would help him figure out what to do. Angela eventually convinced Brandt to go upstairs to retrieve blankets for their infant sisters, who were unharmed, before fleeing the house and seeking help from neighbors. After pursuing his terrified sister outside, Brandt knocked on a neighbor's door, telling her, \"I just shot my mom and dad.\" Herbert later identified his son as his attacker.[3]\nAfter the shooting, Brandt had told Angela that he could not remember what he had done. Angela described her brother as being in a trance-like state, which had broken during their struggle. Upon being interviewed by police, Brandt attributed the shooting to \"a combination of things\" related to school, stating that, \"Everything sort of just snapped in my mind. I felt like I never felt before.\" Brandt also alluded to an incident that took place a few days before the shooting, near the end of his family's annual Christmas vacation in Florida, in which Herbert shot and killed their dog while the two were hunting. \nThree separate psychiatric evaluations failed to determine what triggered the shooting. Because he was too young to be tried for murder under Indiana state law, Brandt spent one year at a psychiatric hospital before being released back into the custody of his family in June 1972.[4] The family never spoke of the incident again. Until 2004, Brandt's two younger sisters had lived under the impression that their mother had been killed in a car accident.\nShortly after Brandt's release, his family relocated to Ormond Beach, Florida. One year later, Brandt's father (who had remarried) and two younger sisters moved back to Indiana, while Brandt and Angela stayed behind in the care of their grandparents. In 1984, Brandt received a degree in electronics and became a radar specialist for Ford Aerospace in Astor. \nIn 1986, Brandt married his girlfriend Theresa \"Teri\" Helfrich. No relatives were invited to their wedding. His sister Angela and her husband Jim had advised Brandt to tell Teri about the murder of their mother, but it is unclear whether or not he ever did. The couple settled in a beach house on Big Pine Key in 1989.\n",

Nu\u00f1ez had been interviewed by Ocurri\u00f3 As\u00ed television reporter Ingrid Cruz, who accompanied him when he visited his daughter's grave.[1] While the crew was filming Nu\u00f1ez at the cemetery, Martin arrived for her own visit, at which time Cruz confronted Martin, who was sitting silently in her vehicle, insisting that Martin answer his questions.[2] Martin and Nu\u00f1ez' 15-year-old daughter, Yoandra, had killed herself in November 1992 following their discovery of her being 13 weeks pregnant, and Nu\u00f1ez had blamed the incident on Martin. Nu\u00f1ez believed that their daughter had been abused by her stepfather and murdered or driven to suicide by her mother.[3] Both theories were rejected by investigators. Yoandra had been raised by Martin; Nu\u00f1ez was prevented from contact with her.[4]\nAs Cruz continued banging on Martin's car window, trying to get her to answer questions, Nu\u00f1ez left the grave site and returned to his vehicle. Martin then left her own car, made a note of Nu\u00f1ez' license plate number, then turned towards the grave, all while ignoring Cruz' constant barrage of questions.[2] As Martin started silently walking towards the grave, with Cruz still peppering her with questions, Nu\u00f1ez suddenly returned with a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol, shot Martin in the back of the head, then shot her now prone body several more times. The cameraman managed to film the shots while Cruz started screaming and ran towards the station vehicle.[2] The footage was later used in the film Bowling for Columbine.[5] It was also shown in the 1993 shockumentary film Traces of Death.[6]\nAt the time of her death, Martin left behind an eighteen-month-old son.[7] She was buried next to her daughter.[8]\nIn 2000, Emilio Nu\u00f1ez was found guilty by a jury in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[9] He was sentenced to life imprisonment, with the possibility for parole after serving 25 years.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe 1982 Overtown riot was a period of civil unrest in Miami, Florida, United States, from December 28 to 30, 1982. The riot was caused by the shooting death of an African American man in the city's Overtown neighborhood by a Latino police officer on December 28, leading to three days of disorder that resulted in one additional death, numerous injuries and arrests, and widespread property damage.\nIn the early 1980s, many black neighborhoods in Miami were experiencing issues such as high unemployment rates, poor living conditions, and widespread illicit drug usage. Additionally, tensions were high between the black community and the Miami Police Department (MPD) over several incidents of police brutality, culminating in the highly destructive 1980 Miami riots following the death of an African American man by several police officers. Also during this time, Miami was undergoing a change in demographics due to increased immigration from Latin America, with some black civic leaders viewing the changes as hurting the established African American community. By 1982, Hispanic American officers outnumbered African Americans in the MPD, and a majority of the Miami City Commission, which included Miami Mayor Maurice Ferr\u00e9. \nOn December 28, 1982, Cuban-born MPD officer Luis Alvarez entered an amusement arcade with his partner in Overtown. Inside, the officer confronted Nevell Johnson Jr., an African American man, over a gun Johnson had on him. According to police reports, after Johnson made a sudden move, Alvarez shot him in the face at point-blank range, putting him in critical condition. He later died at the hospital the following day. Following the shooting, a large crowd gathered around the arcade and began throwing projectiles at police vehicles and setting trash fires. Police cordoned off several blocks surrounding the arcade and confronted the crowd, leading to several injuries and an additional death after police shot and killed a man who was attempting to break into a building. Rioting continued the following day, prompting city officials to declare a restricted area covering several hundred blocks around the arcade. Police were involved in numerous shootouts as they patrolled the area, and police helicopters dropped tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowds. Sporadic rioting continued into the next night, but began to subside, with the restricted area opened on December 31. Over three nights of rioting, 1 person died, 26 were injured, and 43 were arrested. Alvarez, who was suspended with pay following the shooting, was charged by the state of Florida with manslaughter, though he was acquitted by an all-white jury in 1984. A later report issued by the MPD in 1985 stated that his use of deadly force had been justified, but that he may have violated other police procedures during the shooting. \nThe riot was one in a wave to hit not only Miami, but many large metropolitan areas in the United States during the 1980s. Following this one, Miami experienced another period of civil unrest after Alvarez's acquittal in 1984 and a riot in 1989 over another shooting death of an African American man by a Hispanic police officer. Discussing the causes of these riots, some historians have noted the rapid demographic changes occurring in many urban areas during the time period and fears of increased economic competition from other ethnic groups as factors. Additionally, some have pointed to cuts in financing for government social programs that were designed to help underprivileged areas such as Overtown. The riots hurt Miami's reputation, as many shows and movies depicting the city during the 1980s showed it as a crime- and drug-ridden locale. By the early 2000s, the neighborhood still had widespread drug usage and an unemployment rate of about 50 percent. \nOvertown is a historically black neighborhood in Miami,[2][3][4] located north of downtown.[5][6] In 1982, the 4-square-mile (10\u00a0km2) neighborhood was home to about 18,000 people, almost all African American,[7] an ethnic group that constituted about 17 percent of the Miami metropolitan area's 1.6 million residents.[5] Living conditions in the neighborhood around this time were generally considered poor compared to other parts of the city,[5] with the United Press International calling the neighborhood \"4 square miles of slum\".[7] In the 1960s, the construction of Interstates 95 and 395 through the central part of Overtown severely hurt the community, which experienced a severe economic decline through the second half of the 20th century,[1] and by 1982, the neighborhood had an unemployment rate of about 50 percent.[8] In 1980, the Urban League of Miami reported that the median income in Overtown and two other black neighborhoods (Coconut Grove and Liberty City) was $5,500 per year, which was equal to the poverty threshold established by the federal government.[9] Overtown was also subject to a high crime rate and widespread use of illicit drugs,[7][5] due in part to Miami's growth during this time as a center for the illegal drug trade of cocaine and marijuana.[6] Concerning the African American community in Miami in the early 1980s, British journalist Andrew Neil of The Economist wrote, \"Miami is not a good city in which to be black. Blacks, of course, have not fared well in any major American city. But their plight is particularly acute in Miami\".[6]\nThe second half of the 20th century saw a change in Miami's demographics due to a surge in immigration of Latin Americans, with many coming from the Caribbean.[10][11] By the early 1980s, city politics were primarily dominated by non-Hispanic whites and white Latinos.[2][5] In 1982, the five-member Miami City Commission was composed of three Hispanic Americans, including Mayor Maurice Ferr\u00e9, and only one African American.[5] Additionally, of the 1,039 police officers of the Miami Police Department (MPD), only about 170 were black, while about 400 were Hispanic Americans.[5] These changes in demographics led to increased tensions between the African American and Latino communities in the city,[11] with some black civic leaders expressing concerns over losing economic resources to the Hispanic community and charged Hispanic police officers with being more likely to commit acts of police brutality against African Americans.[5]\nOn December 17, 1979, Arthur McDuffie, a 33-year-old African American attorney, was involved in a high-speed chase with Miami police after running a red light and displaying an obscene gesture while on his motorcycle.[2] McDuffie died during the encounter, with the police stating that his death was the result of a motorcycle crash.[2] However, a later investigation revealed that McDuffie had been beaten to death by the police.[2] In March of the following year, four white police officers were charged with McDuffie's death and with attempting to falsify police reports, but on May 17, 1980, an all-white jury in Tampa, Florida, found them not guilty.[2] Following the verdict, rioting broke out in Liberty City,[2] just 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) south of Overtown.[7][8] Due to the size of the civil disturbance, 3,600 members of the Florida Army National Guard were called in, and from May 17 to May 19, three white people were beaten to death, while law enforcement officers killed 11 African Americans.[12] In total, the riots resulted in 18 deaths, 1,100 arrests, and $804 million in property damage.[2] According to historian Sharon Wright Austin, the riots were \"one of the most destructive\" in Miami's history and the first of several to occur during the 1980s as a result of \"some form of police abuse against an African American man\".[2] The death of McDuffie and the accompanying riots were one of a handful of violent incidents involving police and black Miamians in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[9]\nOn December 28, 1982, at a little after 6:00 p.m. EST, two Latino police officers, Luis Alvarez and Louis Cruz,[15] entered an amusement arcade[note 1] in Overtown as part of what Police Chief Kenneth I. Harms stated was a routine inspection for narcotics violations.[13] Alvarez, a Cuban immigrant, was 23 years old and had been an officer with the MPD for about 18 months.[19][18] The two officers had initially been on a patrol in a nearby Latino part of the city, but had decided to go into Overtown,[15] with a later report stating that Alvarez wanted to show Cruz, a trainee, how to conduct a routine check.[18] The arcade, located less than a mile from Miami's central business district,[13] was well-known among police as a place where drug trafficking occurred.[15] Inside the arcade, the officers saw Nevell Johnson Jr.,[12] an African American courier in his early 20s[note 2] who was playing an arcade video game.[2][20] According to the officers, they saw a bulge in Johnson's clothes that they believed was a gun.[13] The officers stated that, after Johnson confirmed it was a gun, Alvarez put his left hand on it while he drew his own .38 caliber police revolver with his right hand.[15] According to the officer, after Johnson made a sudden move, Alvarez shot him, believing that he was trying to reach for his gun.[13][5][15] However, several eyewitnesses to the event stated that the shooting by Alvarez was unprovoked.[18] The bullet struck Johnson at point-blank range,[15] hitting him just above his left eye.[5] Johnson, in critical condition, was quickly rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital,[13] where he laid in a coma for about 24 hours.[15] He died the next day, December 29, at 6:45 p.m.[14]\n",

Raja, while waiting for a tow truck by his disabled car, in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.[1][2][3]\nRaja, who was in plainclothes and in an unmarked white van, approached Jones, who was waiting by his disabled vehicle on a highway exit ramp.[4] Within seconds, Raja fired six shots at Jones, striking him three times.[5] After the shooting, Raja falsely claimed to investigators that he had identified himself as a police officer and shot Jones in self-defense; both assertions were disproved by an audio recording of the fatal shooting.[4]\nOn June 1, 2016, Raja was charged with manslaughter by culpable negligence and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm. He was convicted of the charges on March 7, 2019,[6] following an eight-day jury trial.[4] Raja was sentenced to 25 years in prison on April 25, 2019.[5]\nJones was born to father Clinton Jones Sr., who renovated houses, and mother, Anita Banks, a guidance counselor, who died from cancer in 2006.[7] Jones' older brother, C. J. Jones, was a football player at University of Iowa and from 2003 to 2009 played as a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL).  Jones' sisters are Melissa Jones-Elliott and Chanda and Cevon Jones; his stepmother is Katie Jones.[citation needed] Jones was black, and had a very large extended family; among his cousins are NFL defensive tackle Vince Wilfork and NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin.[8] He lived in Lake Worth, Florida.[1]\nJones attended Christa McAuliffe Middle School in Boynton Beach, Florida, where he played the French horn. His entire family was musical, and played instruments at home and at church.[9] Jones graduated from Santaluces Community High School in Lantana, where he played football.[10] Jones then graduated from the University of Akron with degrees in business administration and music. He worked as a youth mentor at My Brother's Keeper, a nonprofit organization that helps African-American youths.[8]\nJones worked at the Delray Beach Housing Authority for eight years. He was an inspector/assistant property manager, a job that involved inspecting housing units to make sure they were livable. The position also required assisting tenants and landlords with communication.[11][12]\nJones also worked part-time as a drummer.[13] He played in a band at his church, the Bible Church of God in Boynton Beach, where his grandfather, Sylvester Banks Sr., is a bishop. He also played with a band called Future Prezidents with bandmates that included Boris Simeonov and Mathew Huntsberger.[8]\nNouman Raja is a Muslim of Pakistani ancestry.[14][15] He was naturalized as an American citizen in 2001.  His grandfather was a police chief in Pakistan.[15]  He worked for a small Florida police department for several years prior to joining the Palm Beach Gardens police. Raja is married with two children.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "Edward F. Gossett[1] (January 15, 1930 \u2013 January 21, 1985),[1] better known as Eddie Graham, was an American professional wrestler. He was also the promoter and booker for Championship Wrestling from Florida and President of the NWA in the 1970s.\nEdward Gossett[1] was born on January 15, 1930, in Dayton, Tennessee, blind in one eye. He lived in a troubled household and sold newspapers and eggs to make a living while in Chattanooga at the age of 12.[2] The newspaper provided YMCA gym memberships to newsboys, allowing him to receive physical training.[2]\nGossett started wrestling in 1947 in Texas at the age of 17 after being trained by Clarence \"Cowboy\" Luttrall.[3][4] He was occasionally billed as the brother of \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers under the name of Rip Rogers.[4] He lost a loser-leaves-town match to Pepper Gomez in May 1958 in Texas.[4]\nIn June 1958, he changed his ring name, adopting the persona of Eddie Graham, who was billed as the \"brother\" of Dr. Jerry Graham and \"Crazy\" Luke Graham (Superstar Billy Graham would later join the group of brothers).[5] Jerry and Eddie were a very successful villainous tag team on the east coast of the United States.[3] They had popular feuds with teams such as the Fabulous Kangaroos, the Bastien Brothers, Mark Lewin and Don Curtis, and Antonino Rocca and Miguel P\u00e9rez.[3] They held the NWA United States Tag Team Championship (Northeast version) together in Capitol Wrestling (the forerunner of World Wrestling Entertainment) four times, winning the belts three times in victories over Lewin and Curtis, and once against Red and Lou Bastien.[6]\nIn the spring of 1960, Eddie left the team and went to the National Wrestling Alliance's territory in Florida to wrestle. While there, in 1966, he had a feud with Professor Boris Malenko.[3] Eddie took over booking and promoting for Championship Wrestling from Florida in 1971. He wrestled in tag team matches with his son, Mike Graham, until 1977, when he retired from the ring due to health problems. Graham returned to the ring a year later. In 1979, he defeated Killer Khan by pinfall after the referee was knocked out and subsequent interference by Mr. Hito and Kazuo Sakurada on Khan's behalf was fought off by his son Mike and Ray Stevens. Graham's last recorded match was against Terry Funk on March 3, 1982, which was ruled a draw.[7]\nHe was the President of the NWA from 1976 to 1978, thanks in part to Gordon Solie and Dusty Rhodes. Graham was absent as NWA President in 1977 and 1978 due to serious health problems he suffered from, and was forced to step down as a result.[8]\nIn 1968, Graham was lacing his boots in the locker room when a 75-lb steel window fell on his head, detaching both of his retinas and causing him an injury that required three hundred stitches.[3] The Florida Legislature awarded him $23,000 for the incident. According to Jim Wilson in his book Chokehold, Graham's eyesight was poor because of blade jobs, and because he needed surgery to correct the problem and could not afford the money, he had some wrestlers tamper with the window in order to pass it off as though it was the responsibility of the building. This allegation is disputed by eyewitnesses. Also, \"blading\" does not cause eye damage according to noted optometrist Dr. Robert W. McCullough and other eye doctors. Due to the injury, Graham was unable to wrestle for fifteen months.[3]\nGraham made contributions to a number of charitable causes, as chief of the Florida Boys and Girls Ranch Villa.[9] In 1957, Graham, C.P. \u201cCowboy\u201d Luttrall, and Hillsborough Sheriff Ed Blackburn began efforts to establish the organization. Graham donated funds from every Championship Wrestling from Florida show to the Villa, bringing in a reported $100,000, also donating to high school and college level amateur wrestling events.[5]\nGraham remained as the promoter in Florida until January 21, 1985, when he committed suicide by gunshot after a lifelong battle with alcoholism and depression.[3] It is believed that Graham\u2019s participation in a land deal gone wrong led to him needing to raise over $500,000, including financial and marriage problems contributed to his death.[5] His son Mike and grandson Stephen committed suicide in similar manners on October 19, 2012, and December 14, 2010, respectively.[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJerry Michael \"Mike\" Williams (October 16, 1969[2] \u2013 December 16, 2000) was an American murder victim. Initially, it was said he left his home in Tallahassee, Florida, United States, to go duck hunting. After subsequent investigations, he was presumed to have drowned in Lake Seminole, a large reservoir located in the southwest corner of Georgia along its border with Florida; investigators later came to suspect he had been the victim of foul play, possibly at another location.[3] His body was found in October 2017 near Tallahassee,[4] and Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) officials confirmed Williams was a victim of homicide.[5]\nAfter Williams's boat was found abandoned on the lake, the initial theory was that he had fallen out of it after a collision. However, a lengthy and exhaustive search of the lake bed in the area failed to find his body: at that time, it was the only known occasion when no remains or body had been discovered after a drowning death in the lake.[6] It was eventually concluded that his body had been eaten by alligators. After waders and a jacket containing Williams's hunting license were found in the lake six months later, he was declared legally dead, following a court petition by his widow, Denise. She went on to marry Brian Winchester, a mutual friend who had helped her take out a large life insurance policy on Williams shortly before his disappearance.\nSome investigators felt aspects of the case were not consistent with the alligator theory. After years of pressure from Williams's mother, Cheryl, the case was reopened in 2004 by the FDLE. By then, officers had learned that alligators do not, in fact, eat during the winter months, as the water is too cold, and as such, it was suspected that foul play might have occurred. But it did not produce any new evidence, as the potential crime scene had not been secured during the search for Williams.\nCheryl Williams wrote letters daily to the governor, asking him to have the state reopen the investigation even though two later investigations were likewise unable to uncover any significant new information, alienating many of the law enforcement officials she had previously persuaded to reopen it.[7][8] The Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared devoted an episode to the case in 2012.[9] In 2016, Winchester was arrested on charges stemming from an incident where he allegedly kidnapped Denise, the missing man's widow, who was now divorcing him;[10] he was sentenced to 20 years in prison on the day before the FDLE announced that Williams's body had been found. In May 2018, Denise Williams was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and accessory.[11] She was found guilty that December, after Winchester testified to shooting Michael at Denise's behest when their original plan to stage a boating accident failed, and was sentenced to life in prison in January of 2019.[12] In 2020, a Florida appellate court overturned her murder conviction but upheld her murder conspiracy conviction, for which she will serve 30 years.\nJerry Michael Williams was known as Michael or Mike. He grew up in Bradfordville[6] (north of Tallahassee), the son of a Greyhound bus driver[3] and a day care provider who raised him and his older brother Nick in a double-wide trailer. Instead of building a house, the parents saved their money so both boys, who helped by working nights at supermarkets, could attend North Florida Christian High School. There Mike excelled, serving as student council president, playing football and being active in the Key Club. At the age of 15, he began duck hunting as a hobby, and also came to know fellow student Denise Merrell.[13]\nAfter North Florida Christian, he attended Florida State University, where he majored in political science and urban planning.[14] Before graduation, he was hired by Ketcham Appraisal Group as a property appraiser. He distinguished himself as \"the hardest-working man I ever saw\", according to the company's owner. After he married Merrell in 1994, he would often go home for dinner and return to work after she (and later, his daughter as well) went to bed, and he sometimes went into work after going duck hunting in the morning.[13] According to his mother, Mike was making US$200,000 annually by the time of his disappearance.[15] He and Denise had bought a home in a small upscale subdivision on the east side of the city.[2]\nIn 1999, Williams's only child, a daughter, was born. His coworkers said he was as devoted to her as he was to his work. The following year his father died. Midway through the year, the couple bought a $1 million life insurance policy on him through Brian Winchester,[6] a childhood acquaintance of Merrell who had also become best friends with her husband. Later that year, Williams told his mother, whom he had been consoling, that he would have liked to have $50,000 to take the next year off.[3]\nTwo days before his disappearance, Mike and Denise told his mother, as well as his brother Nick, that they were planning to have another child soon. In 2001, she said, they were planning to go on a cruise in Hawaii that spring; later in the year he expected to travel to Jamaica for work as well.[13]\n",

Brazill (born September 22, 1986) is an American man who, at age 13, fatally shot one of his schoolteachers, Barry Grunow, at Lake Worth Middle School in Lake Worth, Florida.

After being sent home from school earlier that day for throwing a water balloon, Brazill had returned home, retrieved a .25-caliber handgun, and shot Grunow.[2][3] Brazill was tried as an adult and convicted of second-degree murder for the killing of Grunow and aggravated assault for pointing the gun at another teacher.[4][3] The jury decided not to convict Brazill of first-degree murder, which requires premeditation and carries a mandatory life sentence in Florida, however, juveniles convicted of first-degree murder in Florida are given a review by a judge after 25 years.[3] Brazill was sentenced to 28 years in state prison followed by 7 years of probation.[2]\nPam Grunow, the widow of the murdered teacher, sued the Brazill family friend that owned the handgun used, the Palm Beach County School Board, and the pawn shop that sold the handgun. These cases were settled for over $1 million. Grunow also filed an action against the gun manufacturer that resulted in a $1.2 million jury verdict, but the trial judge set aside the verdict, and in 2005 the Florida District Court of Appeals upheld this ruling.[5][6]\nBrazill is incarcerated at the Jackson Correctional Institution with a release date set for May 18, 2028.[7] While imprisoned, Brazill earned his GED and certification as a paralegal.[8]\nAs a child, Brazill was surrounded by domestic abuse and alcoholism at home, and local police frequently responded to calls from the Brazill residence.[9] Prior to the Grunow murder, however, Brazill received at least 2 D's as well as an F by Grunow himself, described by teachers as being mild mannered and likeable, and Grunow was his favorite teacher.[10]\n",

He is popularly known as the Ninja killer because he dressed in a full black ninja outfit to avoid identification.[3]\nOn the night of December 20, 1989, Gaskin walked up to the home of 56-year-old Robert and 55-year-old Georgette Sturmfels with a .22 Caliber rifle and wearing a complete black ninja outfit to avoid identification. Gaskin circled the home to the back window, where Robert was sitting in a recliner, and Georgette sat on the sofa. Gaskin fired his gun, shooting Robert five times, killing him, and shooting Georgette once.[3] Georgette was still alive on the first shot, so Gaskin reloaded his gun and shot Georgette in the head, killing her. \nA few hours later, Gaskin drove up to the home of Joseph and Mary Rector. As the Rector's watched the television, Gaskin unloaded his rifle into the home, hitting Joseph. Joseph was able to run out of the room. Mary and Joseph took coverage in a closet until they heard Gaskin smash the back window, so they ran out to the car, where Gaskin started firing at them from inside the house. All of the bullets missed, and the Rectors were able to get in their car and drive away to a nearby hospital. The police were called, and after a search of the home, it was clear the perpetrator had ransacked it. \nWhen the murders became public, Gaskin became a suspect almost immediately after his girlfriend's cousin implicated Gaskin in the killings, saying that Gaskin came home soon after the killings and said he was wrapping some \"presents.\"[3]\nGaskin was arrested on December 30 and soon confessed to the murders. He also confessed to killing a coworker back in 1986, though this is unconfirmed. After a search of Gaskin's home, the \"presents\" were determined to be initially from the Sturmfels property. After a two-month trial in July 1990, Gaskin was found guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder, and he was given two death sentences. He is currently incarcerated at the Union Correctional Institution in Raiford, Florida.[1]\nThis United States biographical article related to crime is a stub.

He poured gasoline out of a large jar, lit a match, ignited the gasoline, and ran out of the cafeteria. Three people were killed and 139 were injured, including many people who were severely burned. \nThe Concord Cafeteria was located at 1921 Collins Avenue in Miami Beach. It was founded in 1947 by Morris Himelstein, who also owned and operated six Concord Cafeterias in New York City. It had 250 seats and served inexpensive, home style food to about 3000 diners a day, many of them retirees. It functioned as an informal social center as well as a restaurant.[1]\nOn the night of February 2, 1973, a man walked into the cafeteria which was crowded with diners, poured gasoline out a jar, ignited it with a match, and ran out of the restaurant. Intense flames spread very rapidly.  People attempted to escape but were obstructed by the turnstiles used to control access to the restaurant.[2] A witness who was a worker at an adjoining restaurant said that he had \"rushed out into the street and scores of old people were lying on the sidewalks and in the road moaning and screaming in lots of pain.\"[2] Another witness said that he saw the interior of the restaurant in flames and \"all the glass was broken and the front was gone.\"[2] Victims were taken to four different  hospitals suffering from burns and smoke inhalation, and fourteen people were in critical condition two days later.[3] Three people died.[1]\nTwenty-two minutes after the fire began, 49 year old Charles Reardon of Bal Harbour, Florida walked into a police station, and said, \"I've done something terrible. I've made a lot of people scream.\" After being questioned for 12 hours, Reardon was charged with arson and use of a destructive device.[3] He was never prosecuted because he was found incompetent to be tried due to mental illness.[1]\nAfter several months of renovations, the Concord Cafeteria reopened. It was the last cafeteria in Miami Beach when it closed ten years later, in June, 1983.[1]\nMany lawsuits against the cafeteria were filed by victims,  which were consolidated into a case called Concord Florida, Inc. v. Lewin. The trial court found the restaurant liable in 1975 and a district appeals court agreed in 1977, ruling that by \"failing to adequately protect its patrons from fire by providing proper safety measures such as emergency exits and signs indicating the location of said exits, appellant-Concord assumed the foreseeable risk that fire might someday trap its patrons leaving them without an escape route.\"[4]\n",

After he was sentenced to death in three separate trials, Henry was executed for the latter murders at the Florida State Prison in 2014.[1]\nIn August 1975, Henry, his 28-year-old common law wife Patricia Roddy, and her two daughters, two and three at the time, were driving around in Dade City. During an argument, Henry stopped the car in a parking lot and stabbed Roddy to death.[2] After the killing, he fled towards a wooded area in Zephyrhills, where he was tracked down and arrested by a sheriff's deputy named Fay Wilber. Medical examiner Joan Wood testified that Roddy had been stabbed around 30 times, mostly in the neck and upper body.[2] Henry pleaded no contest to second degree murder and received a 15-year prison sentence with a chance of parole.[2][3]\nIn January 1983, Henry was paroled after serving 7-and-a-half years of his murder conviction. After his release, he married 28-year-old convenience store clerk Suzanne Overstreet, a divorced Zephyrhills woman with a 4-year-old son named Eugene \"Buggy\" Christian. The couple's marriage proved unstable, as both of them were arrested on multiple occasions for possessing and selling drugs. Henry had numerous convictions for firearms offenses.[4] By August 1984, Suzanne had gone to a women's shelter, citing her fear that her husband would harm both her and her son, and reportedly sought to have a restraining order issued against him.[5] On December 22, 1985, Henry went to her apartment to ask whether he could buy any Christmas gifts for Christian. Suzanne allowed him inside, but then the pair began to argue.[6] Henry later said that the two fought over a knife before he stabbed Suzanne 13 times.[7] While she lay dying on the ground, Henry supposedly sat down and watched while smoking a cigarette.[8] After wrapping her body in a rug, Henry stole a car and took Christian to a pasture near Thonotosassa, where he stabbed him to death behind a chicken farm.[4]\nOn the following day, Suzanne Henry's body was discovered by her sisters after she had not gone to work in the morning.[4] The authorities questioned neighbors who indicated that they had seen her husband John leave the apartment, accompanied by her son Christian. Authorities learned that he had registered at the local Twilight Motel with another woman.[7] Detective Fay Wilber, the same deputy who had caught Henry a decade prior, immediately recognized him, and after reading his Miranda rights, Wilber took him to the sheriff's office. Under questioning, Henry admitted that he had killed the boy, and later led the authorities to the pasture where he had stabbed him to death.[7] He was then questioned over his wife's death, to which he readily admitted guilt as well.[9]\nAs the two killings took place in separate counties, it was decided that Henry would have two trials: one in Hillsborough County for Christian's murder, and another in Pasco County for his wife's.[10]\nIn preliminary hearings, his attorneys attempted to block a motion to introduce the confession from Henry, in which he implicated himself in both murders. Det. Wilber was brought in to testify, recalling that Henry had voluntarily admitted to both killings, albeit refusing to write them down or have them recorded.[11] At both trials, Henry's attorneys argued that their client should not be considered eligible for the death penalty, claiming that his dependency on alcohol and drugs, as well as low-grade schizophrenia present since his birth, classified him as intellectually impaired.[12] However, several psychiatrists who examined Henry determined that his schizophrenia did not impact his judgment and he could distinguish right from wrong.[2] In the end, Henry was convicted on all counts in both trials and sentenced to death twice.\nFour years later, however, the Supreme Court of Florida ruled that the extensive testimony concerning Christian's murder prejudiced the jury in the Suzanne Henry trial.[13] In particular, it was noted that the jurors were shown autopsy photos of Christian's corpse, and so, it was ordered that Henry should be retried in both murders.[14]\nIn the retrial, Wilber was brought in to testify again, repeating his testimony from years prior and emphasizing the apparent fact that Henry had attacked his wife, as nothing else in the apartment seemed out of place to indicate a fight.[15] In the end, Henry was found guilty on all counts in the retrials, and was again resentenced to death.\nFor the remainder of his life, Henry's attorneys attempted to appeal his sentence on the grounds that he was supposedly intellectually disabled on account of his abusive childhood, schizophrenia, and 70 IQ.[16] All of his appeals were denied, and Governor Rick Scott signed his death warrant in 2014.[16]\n",

The shooting from start to finish lasted 70\u201380 seconds. Santiago was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and pleaded guilty to avoid possible execution. On August 17, 2018, Santiago was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences plus 120 years in prison.\nOn January 6, 2017, at 12:53\u00a0p.m. EST, the shooter, who had flown in from Alaska, opened fire with a Walther PPS 9mm semi-automatic pistol in the Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport. He opened fire in the baggage claim area of Terminal 2, which is the host terminal for Delta Air Lines and Air Canada.[1][2][3][4][5][6] He killed five people and injured six others.[7] The shooting lasted 70 to 80 seconds.[8] The shooter had purchased the gun legally, and legally checked it in his luggage.[7] After he stopped shooting, the suspect lay down on the floor.[9]\nA nearby Broward County Sheriff's Office (BSO) deputy immediately responded by running to the sound of gunfire, and apprehended the suspect within 85 seconds.[10] The deputy had been trained to react immediately to an active shooter, and said: \"I was basically going - reacting ... - what I was trained to do. So I went towards the shooting.\"[10] The following year, the BSO deputy was named Deputy of the Year by the Florida Sheriffs Association.[10] Other responding BSO officers also reacted in a manner that Special Master J. Dudley Goodlette, who later reviewed the incident, said was \"textbook.\"[10] Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said that law enforcement officers did not fire shots, and arrested the gunman without further incident.[6] The Special Master found that the shooting \"was not preventable by Sheriff Israel or anyone else\".[10]\nVideo showed travelers rushing out of the airport, and hundreds of people waiting on a ramp, as numerous law enforcement officers rushed to the scene.[6]  A brief panic occurred following \"unfounded reports of additional gunshots\". The false alarm touched off a brief panic in other terminals.[1] Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted from the airport, \"Shots have been fired. Everyone is running.\"[1]\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop notice, closing the airport to all but emergency flights.[11] Port Everglades, staffed by the American Red Cross, assisted about 10,000 passengers who were bussed there for food, shelter, and to connect to transportation.[1] The airport remained closed for the remainder of the day, but reopened to commercial flights early the following day.[1] Following the shooting, more than 20,000 pieces of baggage were left at the airport amid the chaos.[8]\nPresident Obama was briefed about the shooting by Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he was monitoring the situation and that he had spoken with Florida Governor Rick Scott regarding the shooting.[12] President Obama later consoled the victims and said that he had asked his staff to reach out to Mayor Jack Seiler in order to make sure efforts were coordinated between state and local officials.[13] Scott ordered flags of the United States and of Florida to be flown at half-mast throughout the state on January 7 and 8 to honor the victims.[14]\nAfter the shooting, Sheriff Israel called for a ban on assault rifles to be reinstated, and said that he didn\u2019t believe that people with mental illness should have access to firearms.[15] He said: \u201cAll I\u2019m going to do is speak my mind. If I\u2019m on an island, I\u2019m on an island. I\u2019m not going to worry about who is with me or who is not.\u201d[15]\nFive people died in the attack, all of whom were passing through Fort Lauderdale to begin cruises with their spouses.[16] The number of people injured due to the shooting was six, with three admitted to intensive care units.[17] The sheriff said that in addition to the people injured by gunshots, about 30 to 40 others were \"injured in the panic\" during the event.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "Willie Jasper Darden, Jr. (June 1, 1933 \u2013 March 15, 1988) was an African American man who was executed in Florida for murder during the course of a robbery. Darden's case was notable because of the 14 years that he spent on death row between his death sentence and his execution, which, at the time, was longer than the time any other inmate in the United States had spent on death row prior to their execution. He was also notable for the number of protests and amount of controversy and attention that his case attracted worldwide, as well as the unusually large number of death warrants that he lived through prior to his execution.\nWillie Darden was born in Greene County, North Carolina on June 1, 1933. His family lived in poverty as Darden grew up. His father was an auto-mechanic, and his great-grandfather had been a slave who was also born in Greene County. Darden's mother was 15 years old at the time of his birth, and two years after he was born, she died while giving birth to another child. Because of his family's poverty, Darden could not attend school regularly and instead worked in the farms, eventually dropping out of school after completing the eighth grade.[1]\nWhen Darden was a teenager, he started breaking the law, starting after he was caught stealing from a mailbox. Upon his first violation of the law at the age of 16, Darden was sent to a juvenile detention facility. After being discharged, Darden had trouble finding work and was eventually rearrested for cashing a bad check. He received a 4-year sentence in prison for the bad check. Until the murder in 1973, Darden was repeatedly in and out of prison for a variety of crimes, including assault, forgery, theft, and attempted rape. At the time of the murder, Darden was on furlough from prison while serving 20 years in a Florida prison for attempting to rape a 70-year-old woman in 1968.[1][2]\nOn September\u00a08, 1973, at a time police estimated to be between 6:00 and 6:30\u00a0p.m., there was a robbery of a Carl's Furniture Store, located in Lakeland, Florida. During the robbery, James Carl Turman and his 16-year-old neighbor Phillip Arnold were shot. Arnold survived the shooting, but Turman died.[3] The robber also attempted to rape Turman's wife prior to shooting and murdering Turman.[2]\nDarden was arrested later that day for a traffic violation. While he was in jail for the traffic violation, investigators tied Darden to the murder of Turman as well as a string of similar robberies and assaults in the area. Subsequently, Darden was charged with murder and robbery.[3]\nDarden, who was black, had an all-white jury at his trial, which took place in January 1974.[4] The state had intentionally excluded black people from serving on the jury, a practice that was later declared unconstitutional in 1986, and a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Harry Blackmun, would later declare that the jury selection in Darden's case was improper and violated his constitutional rights. Additionally, according to trial records, the prosecutor in Darden's trial, C. Ray McDaniel, made racially charged remarks, including repeatedly calling Darden an \"animal\" that needed to be \"chained up\" and expressing a desire to see Darden \"sitting here with no face, blown away by a shotgun.\"[1][3]\nThree witnesses to Turman's murder\u2009\u2014\u2009Turman's wife, Phillip Arnold, and another neighbor\u2009\u2014\u2009all identified Darden as the murderer. None of them were ever asked to identify Darden in a police lineup, but they identified him in court, although Turman's wife had difficulty identifying Darden and Phillip Arnold described the killer as being larger than Darden was. Darden's lawyers did not challenge the eyewitnesses at the trial. A woman named Christine Bass claimed that Darden had been at her house during the time that the murder was committed, from 4:00 to 5:30\u00a0p.m., saying that Darden had needed to use her phone to call for help. Darden's defense attorneys never called her to testify. Additionally, years after the trial, the victim's minister gave an affidavit claiming that he was called to the crime scene and arrived at 5:55\u00a0p.m., which meant that the crime would have happened prior to the time that the police said it had. Both the victim's minister and Bass gave affidavits that would have helped Darden with constructing his alibi.[3]\nNevertheless, on January\u00a023, 1974, Willie Darden was convicted of the murder and robbery of James Carl Turman. The jury recommended the death penalty, and he was sentenced to death. He was received on death row at the Florida State Prison on January\u00a029, 1974.[4]\nDuring Darden's time on death row, hundreds of people worldwide protested his death sentence, including Pope John Paul II, Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, the human rights organization Amnesty International (who started a petition that gathered 10,000 signatures from people in the Netherlands who were opposed to Darden's execution), and the Reverend Jesse Jackson, who called Darden's death sentence \"another example that injustice is still alive and well and that equal opportunity is still denied black Americans even in death.\"[2] Two months before his execution, Darden appeared on an episode of 20/20 on ABC and an episode of West 57th on CBS.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nWilliam Madison Wood (June 18, 1858 \u2013 February 2, 1926) was an American textile mill owner of Lawrence, Massachusetts who was considered to be an expert in efficiency.[citation needed] He made a good deal of his fortune through being hired by mill owners to turn around failing mills and was despised by organized labor.\nWilliam Wood was born in 1858 in a cottage on Pease Point Way, in Edgartown, Massachusetts, on the island of Martha's Vineyard.[1] His parents, Grace (Emma) Wood and William Wood Sr., were Portuguese immigrants from the Azores. His father, William Sr., Guilherme Medeiros Silva was a crewman on a New Bedford whaling ship from 1853 until his death in 1871.  (The Portuguese word \"silva\" translates into English as \"wood\" or \"forest\".)  William Jr. was only 12 years old when his father died, and had to drop out of school and find a job to provide for his mother and younger siblings. Fortunately for William Wood, Andrew G. Pierce, a wealthy New Bedford textile manufacturer, offered him a job working in his Wamsutta Cotton Mill.  Pierce would soon see that hiring young William would prove to be extremely beneficial.  Pierce was impressed with Wood's work and promoted him to the manufacturing department, where he learned cost structures and figures. At the age of eighteen, Wood left New Bedford for Philadelphia.  With the help of Andrew Pierce, William was able to find a good job with a Philadelphia brokerage firm.  This is where he learned about stocks and bonds.  After tiring of Philadelphia, he returned to New Bedford and worked at a bank.  According to the Dukes County Intelligencer, when a Fall River textile company went bankrupt, its new manager hired William as paymaster. Then in 1885, the Washington Mill in Lawrence went bankrupt and was purchased by Frederick Ayer of Lowell. Frederick Ayer and his brother James Cook Ayer were successful patent medicine producers.[2]\nAyer was a multi-millionaire but knew nothing about the textile industry.  This is when Ayer's new manager convinced Wood to leave his previous position and be his assistant in charge of manufacturing.  A short time later, Wood was promoted to treasurer, and four years later he was made manager. Wood was then making a substantial amount of money for the time, around $25,000 a year. Within three years of his promotion, William Wood married Ayer's daughter Ellen (eventually making him a brother-in-law to General George S. Patton) in 1888.[1] Ellen was well educated; she studied at a finishing school in France and then attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, MA.  Wood was determined to make the Washington Mill a success for himself and his newly acquired family.  Wood did make the Washington Mill a success and decided to move on to bigger goals.  He set out to merge some of the small, struggling mills of New England into one mammoth money-making company, his company. By 1899, William Wood had convinced seven such mills to join what he called \"The Woolen Trust\". In April of that same year the company was incorporated under a new name, the American Woolen Company.  Frederick Ayer bought half of the shares, and Wood purchased the rest.[2]\nIn 1912, the Lawrence Mill workers, organized and backed by the union, IWW, went on strike. William Wood was required to shorten the work week for all employees. He did cut the work week from fifty-six hours to fifty-four hours, but he also increased the speed at which the looms ran in order to keep from losing profits.  The workers were angry that they were working just as hard and producing just as much as they would in a fifty-six-hour week, but only getting paid for fifty-four hours.\nDuring the strike, the police found explosives in three different places along the mills. Meanwhile, Wood settled with the strikers, giving them time and a quarter for overtime and thirty cents more a week to piece-workers.  The problem was solved for the moment, but the authorities were looking into the explosives. Eventually, by tracing the serial numbers on the dynamite, the authorities received a confession from the mill contractor, Ernest Pittman.  He told them that he and another man, John Breen, had planted the explosives to implicate the IWW.  Since they were both employed by William Wood, Wood was indicted for conspiracy to destroy the mills.  After a long trial, the grand jury found William Wood not guilty on June 6, 1913.[3]\nMoving on with his life, William made big plans for his company's headquarters at Shawsheen Village, Massachusetts. This meant moving from the previous location in Lawrence.  The entire project took about five years from 1918 to 1923. Wood transformed a quiet residential community into a self-sufficient neighborhood for his employees; it included industrial, residential and recreational facilities. During those years, the First World War kept the woolen industry alive.  Wood was swamped with Army contracts that helped his company grow. By 1924, the company owned sixty mills and employed over 40,000 people. In 1924, William Wood suffered a stroke.  His doctor advised him to retire and rest.  Taking his doctors advice, William Wood retired and named Andrew Pierce Jr. his successor.  Pierce Jr. was the son of the man who gave Wood his first job.  In January 1926, he and his wife Ellen moved to Florida. He committed suicide in  Daytona Beach on February 2, 1926.[4]\nAfter Wood's death, his fortune became the subject of a major U.S. Supreme Court decision on the interpretation of the income tax laws.  In the case of Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, 279 U.S. 716 (1929),[5] Chief Justice William Howard Taft held that where a third party (in this case, American Woolen Co.) pays the income tax owed by an individual, the amount of tax paid constitutes additional taxable income to that individual.  The executors of his will therefore had to pay the back taxes on his estate.\nWood owned the Shawsheen Indians which won the 1924\u201325 National Challenge Cup.  In June 1925, the Indians entered the American Soccer League.  Following Wood's death, the Indians withdrew from the league and folded.[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "The murder of Diana Miller took place on July 21, 2006, when Diana Miller and her husband James Miller were robbed at gunpoint by three men in their family home in The Villages, Florida. Both James and Diana were shot in the back of the head with Diana's shooting proving fatal. Sheila Miller, the disabled daughter of the couple, was kidnapped by the three men and taken in the family van to Ocala, Florida. The group entered a mall where the men used Sheila to withdraw cash from the family's personal bank accounts from several ATM machines.[1] Officers eventually caught up with the men and chased them down in a recorded high-speed pursuit which resulted in a violent crash. One of the suspects was ejected from the vehicle during the crash and became pinned and trapped under the van. The robber who was identified as the shooter and killer of Diana Miller, Renaldo McGirth, was sentenced to death for the crime two years later, becoming the youngest person on death row in Florida at the time.[2]\nSheila Miller, the daughter of Diana and James Miller, had a long-term problem with alcohol and drug abuse.[3] In 1989, she was arrested for drug possession. Just prior to the July 2006 murder, Sheila had been involved in a car accident, which had caused damage to her knee, pelvis and toe, resulting in her moving back in with her parents at their family home in The Villages. Her parents were both retired and had rented beds, wheelchairs and other equipment for her during her stay.[3]\nOn July 21, 2006, Sheila received a phone call from her former drug dealer, Renaldo Devon McGirth, whom she only knew as \"Pooney.\" She had not heard from him in over two years and had met him through an acquaintance. McGirth told her he had heard of her recent accident and sympathized with her. He told her he felt bad for her situation and had a gift for her, resulting in Sheila giving him directions to the family home. After giving McGirth directions, he and two accomplices, Theodore Houston and Jarrord Marqui Roberts arrived at the house. Within minutes of their arrival, Sheila wheeled herself into her room to smoke a cigarette. McGirth and Houston followed her, then tied her hands, head, and mouth with duct tape. Sheila then watched McGirth shoot Diana Miller, in the chest in her bedroom. Diana fell onto the bed and began coughing up blood. Despite this, Diana insisted she was fine and told Sheila everything would be alright. Afterward, Sheila was abducted by the trio and taken to the Millers' family van.[4] McGirth then returned to the house and shot both Diana and her husband James in the back of the head. James survived, but Diana died later in the hospital. The three men then fled the scene with Sheila held hostage in the back of the stolen van.[5]\nThe men drove to Ocala, Florida, where they forced Sheila into a mall and made her withdraw cash from ATMs with bank cards the trio had stolen from the family house. Diana and James were financially well off, influencing the men to carry out the home invasion. The men threatened to kill her if she did not comply with their demands. The Marion County Sheriff's Office had received 911 calls from James Miller informing them his wife had been shot and that his daughter had been kidnapped. Police found the suspects at a store north of Ocala on U.S. 441. A chase resulted after the suspects took off and continued at high speeds. The chase finally ended when deputies used stop sticks, which blew out the tires and eventually caused the van they were in to flip several times. One of the suspects was ejected from the van during the crash and pinned down under the vehicle. He would have been crushed to death had the van not landed on another car during the crash. The other two suspects tried to flee but were captured and arrested. Sheila was then pulled free from the van and rescued.[6]\nBoth James and Sheila survived the incident, but Diana died in hospital as a result of the gunshot wound to the back of the head inflicted by McGirth. The youngest of the three robbers, Theodore Houston, was seventeen at the time of the robbery. Houston agreed to testify against his two accomplices in exchange for a lighter sentence of twenty-five to forty years in prison as part of a plea agreement. Roberts was sentenced to spend the remainder of his life in jail but was spared the death penalty. After being identified as the shooter and killer of Diana, McGirth was sentenced to death at the age of twenty in 2008 for the murder,[7] becoming the youngest man in Florida at the time to be on the list.[8] His death sentence was overturned in 2017 because the jury did not vote unanimously.[9] McGirth is awaiting resentencing.[10][11]\nFootage of the police chase with the van was recorded by the pursuing patrol car's dashboard camera. This footage was featured in an episode of Most Shocking as well as an interview with the pursuing officer, Lieutenant Bill Sowder, who described the chase and its aftermath.[12]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nClaude Hudson \"Butch\" Trucks (May 11, 1947 \u2013 January 24, 2017) was an American drummer. He was best known as a founding member of The Allman Brothers Band, for which he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Trucks was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. He played in various groups before forming the 31st of February while at Florida State University in the mid-1960s. He joined the Allman Brothers Band in 1969. Their 1971 live release, At Fillmore East, represented an artistic and commercial breakthrough. The group became one of the most popular bands of the era on the strength of their live performances and several successful albums. Though the band broke up and re-formed various times, Trucks remained a constant in their 45-year career.  Trucks died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on January 24, 2017.\nClaude Hudson Trucks was born on May 11, 1947, in Jacksonville, Florida. His father was an optician.[1] He first discovered his talent at drumming when prompted by a band director at Ribault Junior High: \"The band director gave three of us sticks and said, 'Play me something,'\" he recalled. He then attended Jean Ribault High School, where he was made first chair as a freshman. Trucks was in two bands before later graduating from Englewood High School in 1965: The Vikings, who released one 7-inch in 1964, and the Echoes, which mainly played Beatles covers.[2] Trucks attended Florida State University for one year; he once said he \"majored in staying out of Vietnam.\"[3] His grades suffered from poor attendance and he was kicked out.[4]\nDuring this time, Trucks formed a band, the Bitter Ind., with two high school friends. The group played covers of Bob Dylan, the Byrds, and the Lovin' Spoonful. They relocated to Daytona Beach in hopes of finding greater success, but were often turned away by owners because their patrons were unable to dance to the music.[5] At one club, he met members of the Allman Joys, including brothers Duane and Gregg Allman. The band changed their name to the 31st of February fearing legal action from New York nightclub The Bitter End. The band signed a deal with Vanguard Records, and their self-titled debut album was released in 1968. The group briefly toured with the Allmans under various names, recording demos later released in 1972 as Duane & Greg Allman.\nTired of his then-middling music career, Trucks pondered going back to school to study mathematics.[4] In 1969, he was invited to join a new project headed by Duane Allman, who had secured a record deal with Atlantic Records.[6] Allman introduced Trucks to Jai Johanny Johanson (Jaimoe), who would also be a drummer in the band. Together, the two developed a rhythmic drive that would prove crucial to the band. Trucks laid down a powerful conventional beat while the jazz-influenced Johanson added a second layer of percussion and ad libitum cymbal flourishes, seamlessly melded into one syncopated sound. Said founding member and co-lead guitarist Dickey Betts of Trucks' addition to the original band lineup, \"When Butch came along, he had that freight train, meat-and-potatoes kind of thing that set Jaimoe up perfectly. He had the power thing we needed.\"[7] The group became the Allman Brothers Band, who began touring heavily and released their first, self-titled album, later that November.[8] Trucks continued to record and perform with the Allman Brothers Band until they disbanded in 2014.\nFrom 1982 to 1984, during one of the periods in which the Allmans were broken up, Trucks was part of the group Betts, Hall, Leavell and Trucks.[9]\nAlong with Allman Brothers band members Johanson, Betts and Gregg Allman, Trucks was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against UMG Recordings. The suit, initiated in 2008, sought $10 million over royalties from compact disc sales and digital download services such as Apple's iTunes. Trucks saw the license given to users for downloads as legally unsound.[10] Trucks embraced Internet technology for the group and planned to use Moogis.com (now defunct) to make the Web a \"real venue\" for the Allman Brothers and other jam bands.[10][11] In the Brothers' later years, he helped connect them to the extended jam band scene.[12] In 2013, he formed the Roots Rock Revival master camp experience.[13]\nIn 2015, Trucks performed at two festivals with a band billed as Butch Trucks & Very Special Friends. This band evolved into a band called Les Brers which was led by Trucks and also featured other former Allman Brothers band members including his longtime drumming partner Johanson.[14] He also performed with a band called Butch Trucks & The Freight Train Band.[15]\nTrucks had a long interest in philosophy and literature. In 2005, The New York Times Book Review published a letter from Trucks criticizing writer Roy Blount, Jr.'s reference to Duane Allman as \"one of these churls\" in a review of Splendor in the Short Grass: The Grover Lewis Reader. The letter further criticized Grover Lewis for his 1971 Rolling Stone article about the band, which Trucks wrote made the members look like uneducated characters who spoke in dialogue \"taken directly from Faulkner\".[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Garlin case refers to the murder of Tammie Garlin and the earlier physical abuse of Garlin's 11-year-old son on June 4, 2007 by their roommate Candace Clark, her boyfriend Micheal Sisk and her girlfriend Micheala Clark. Garlin's 15-year-old daughter is alleged to have been a willing participant in her mother's murder and the abuse of her brother. The case drew attention to blind spots in the U.S. state of Florida's child-protection system.\nThe adults involved were Candace L. Clark (born February 20, 1984), Clark's boyfriend; Michael J. Sisk (born December 22, 1981), and Michaela Shawn Clerc (born July 13, 1986), reported to be Tammie Garlin's lover. The juvenile involved was 15-year-old Felicia Mae Garlin (born August 28, 1991), daughter of the deceased woman and sister of the abused boy.[1]\nPortage, Wisconsin, law-enforcement officers became aware of the situation on June 15, 2007, when following up on a Lake County, Florida, warrant for Clark, who was charged with unlawfully removing her 2-year-old daughter from the foster-care custody of Clerc's parents. While local media routinely reported on the process, national media began coverage when four individuals were arraigned by video hookup in Columbia County (WI) Circuit Court on July 20. By the next day, international news agencies had picked up the story.[2]\nWhen the police approached the house, the door was answered by Clark. Allegedly providing an alias, she denied that Michael Sisk resided there. The officers consulted photographs and, since the woman resembled Clark and a photograph resembled the 2-year-old in question, further inquiry was made of the household. Clark eventually admitted that the child in question was known by two names.\nFifteen-year-old Felicia Garlin (who also provided an alias) was interviewed, and said her mother was unavailable. Michaela Clerc was also questioned by the officers. When it became clear that the women were lying about their identities and there was reasonable cause to suspect that the child in question was the one abducted from Florida, the household was taken to the Portage police station and the three youngest children placed in protective custody (see pp.\u00a011\u201312 of complaint).[2]\nIn addition to her 2-year-old, Clark had two other small daughters with her (a 1-year-old and a 3-month-old); both were subsequently placed in protective custody. The Florida complaint indicated that Sisk was the father of the two younger girls (including the child involved in the custody case). A WTMJ-TV story suggested that the youngest child may have been Felicia Garlin's, and indicated that Felicia's brother and the three small children would remain in the custody of the Wisconsin child-protection system.[3] The head of the Florida child-protection system, Robert Butterworth, said \"We are asking the Pinellas judge to relinquish jurisdiction in Florida and let them [i.e., the Wisconsin authorities] take care of the case.\"[4]\nAt the police station, Clerc indicated that an 11-year-old boy who had been burned would be found at the house (p.\u00a012 of complaint).[2] The boy, identified by the initials \"ACG\", was found in a closet. Page 12 of the complaint states:\nACG, DOB 10/13/1995. ACG was sitting on the floor of an upstairs bedroom closet with his knees pulled up to his chest. ACG had obvious wounds all over his body. ACG started crying when he saw the officers and said that he did not want to go to jail.[2]The Garlin boy was taken to Divine Savior Hospital, and transferred to the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison. At the UW hospital, he was diagnosed with extensive injuries. Pages 12\u201313 of the complaint state:\n",

        "paragraph": "Eddie Lee Sexton (May 12, 1942 \u2013 December 29, 2010) was an American convicted murderer and rapist known for compelling his children to murder and committing sexual abuse against his own family which he ruled in a cult-like manner.[1] He fathered at least three children with two of his daughters.[2] Rick Terrana, Eddie Sexton's defense attorney, described the Sextons as the \"most dysfunctional family in America.\"[3] The case earned national attention, due in part to some of the graphic and sensational details revealed in court.[4]\nEddie Lee Sexton was captured after living as a fugitive for over a year to avoid child abuse charges. He was sentenced to death for orchestrating the murder of his son-in-law, Joel, by holding a gun to the head of his own son, Willie, and telling him to strangle Joel. Sexton was also given an additional 15 years for conspiracy to commit kidnapping and murder of an acquaintance. After appeal, Sexton's death penalty case was overturned and a new trial ordered. After retrial he was again found guilty and sentenced to death, but died in prison of natural causes.\nEddie Lee Sexton was born near rural Logan, West Virginia to a family of coal miners. His father was a part-time Baptist preacher. In 1963, he committed armed robbery of a gas station the day after marrying his pregnant 15-year-old girlfriend. He was sentenced to five years in state prison for the robbery, and his wife filed for divorce after giving birth to a son, Patrick.[2]\nEddie later married Estella May, and they would have twelve children. Eddie and Estella settled in Stark County, Ohio.[2]\nEddie was regarded as charming and polite upon first impression, but those who knew him well saw him as a serial con artist and fraudster. Though receiving Social Security disability payments due to an allegedly serious back injury, he also worked for cash as a painter and handyman. He was suspected of having committed insurance fraud by setting three fires at his homes in the 1980s and faking burglaries and falsely reporting stolen items.[5]\nIn the 1970s he briefly worked as an independent Christian preacher, espousing a highly unorthodox doctrine emphasizing sex and apocalyptic predictions that he would later use to indoctrinate and intimidate his children. Journalist Lowell Cauffiel wrote:  \"Eddie Lee Sexton certainly maintained his own place of worship. But nobody could figure out what gospel he was preaching. A little general occult. A little fundamentalism. A little Satanism. A little sci-fi hustle...\"[6] Neighbor Augusta Houston would report that Eddie claimed to worship both God and the Devil.[2]\nThe Sexton children would later describe Eddie and Estella as committing extreme acts of abuse almost daily. All the children were sexually abused by both parents, were beaten and locked in their rooms for minor infractions, and routinely suffered other indignities.[2] The Sexton children attended public schools, and while Eddie allowed them to have only one friend each they were not allowed to visit friends' homes and friends were not allowed in the Sexton home. The Sexton children believed their father had supernatural powers, such as telepathy and the ability to summon ghosts or spirits. \nSubsequent to the abuse, many of the children became sexually reactive with or sexually abusive toward one another. Eddie staged mock wedding ceremonies with several of his daughters as preludes to his raping them[7] (photos of these weddings are printed in Cauffiel's book House of Secrets, with Eddie's daughters wearing bridal veils in their family living room).  His children would later report Eddie conducting such events as a seance-like ceremony involving a dead cat[8] and forcing the children to sign contracts in their own blood stating they would go to hell for disobeying him.[2]\nEddie impregnated his teenage daughter Estella (known as \"Pixie\" to distinguish daughter from mother who shared the same name). He encouraged her to find a boyfriend to avert suspicion from himself. Pixie met Joel Good, a high school classmate described as slow-witted and overly trusting.[9] They had an on-off romance, eventually marrying despite the reservations of Joel's family about his marrying a young woman with two young girls, Dawn and Shasta, of uncertain parentage. After the wedding, Pixie gave birth to a boy they named Skipper Lee Good.[10]\n",

According to reports, Nancy Weiler was \"beaten almost beyond recognition\" by Davis with a .357 Magnum, and hit more than 25 times in the face and head. He was additionally convicted of killing Nancy Weiler's two daughters, Kristina, age 9, who was shot twice in the face, and Katherine, age 5, who was shot as she tried to run away and then had her skull beaten in with the gun. \nDavis, who had a lengthy criminal history, was on parole for armed robbery at the time of the murders. He later admitted that his initial motive was to rape and murder Kristina, kill her sister and mother, and then ransack the house.[1]\nDavis was executed on July 8, 1999, via electrocution.[2] His execution was alleged to have been botched, with witnesses reporting that Davis was still alive after the power to Old Sparky was switched off. Blood had also leaked from Davis's nose during the execution, although prison officials alleged this was caused by a nose bleed. \nBecause of the controversy surrounding his execution, Davis remains the last person executed by electric chair in Florida.[3] All subsequent executions in Florida have been carried out by lethal injection, although inmates can still choose to be executed by electric chair.\nDavis had prior convictions for armed robbery, attempted armed robbery, use of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and involuntary manslaughter. He also had a history of child molestation.[4] Nancy Weiler's husband, John Weiler, would later call Davis a \"deviant animal that should have been permanently caged or executed many years before May 1982.\"[1]\nFor his last meal, Davis requested and received a dinner consisting of one lobster tail, fried potatoes, a half pound of fried shrimp, six ounces of fried clams, half a loaf of garlic bread, and 32 US fluid ounces (950\u00a0ml) of A&W Root Beer.[5]\nAccording to the licensed electrical engineer who managed the equipment, the amount of electrical energy applied to Davis in three steps was:[1]\nThe maximum power was 15.0 kW, which is approximately equal to 11.2 horsepower.  The maximum output of a standard U.S. 15 Ampere electrical outlet is 1.8 kW [6] or 1.3 horsepower. \nThe total energy used was 299.4 kJ or 284 British thermal units (BTU), over a period of 38 seconds.\n",

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

Her ex-boyfriend, Timothy \"Tracey\" Humphrey, and his wife Ashley Laney Humphrey, were convicted of her murder.\nTimothy Alvin \"Tracey\" Humphrey (born November 15, 1966)[1] was Sandee Rozzo's coworker at the time of her murder. They had previously been in a brief, but volatile relationship. He had committed an assault on Ms. Rozzo and criminal proceedings were in progress. The two had originally met at an Ybor City, Florida nightclub in November 2001 where Humphrey worked as a doorman and Sandee was a bartender.[2] Humphrey had a long previous criminal record of convictions for motor vehicle theft, kidnapping and aggravated assault.[1] The following February, Humphrey was arrested for felony battery after allegedly beating and sexually assaulting Sandee. He was due to go to trial on that charge on August 4, 2003, one month after Sandee's murder.[2]\nAshley Christine Humphrey (n\u00e9e Laney; born October 13, 1982)[3] was working at Planet Smoothie in Brandon, Florida when she met Tracey Humphrey at a local gym in 2002.[4] Ashley and Tracey married on July 4, 2003, one day before Sandee's murder.[4]\nOn July 5, 2003, Sandee Rozzo was shot to death in the garage of her Pinellas Park, Florida townhouse after returning home from her shift at the Green Iguana, a local bar.[2] Sandee's coworker Tracey Humphrey became the prime suspect.[5] Humphrey had an alibi however, claiming that he had ordered a pizza to his Brandon, Florida apartment at the time of the crime.[6] This was verified by an acquaintance, Tobe White. Further investigation however, revealed that his wife of one day, Ashley Humphrey, was not at home during the crime, as cell phone records indicated that Ashley was actually in Pinellas Park, Florida when Sandee was killed.[7] Ashley Humphrey was arrested for the first-degree murder of Sandra Rozzo and her husband Tracey Humphrey was charged with a federal firearms possession.[2] While she was in custody, Ashley Humphrey decided to cooperate with authorities. She had admitted that she shot Sandra Rozzo to death, but claimed it was at the behest of her husband. In her statement, she told vivid details about the plot to murder Sandee. In addition, she also gave up details regarding another failed murder attempt against Sandee. In a plea bargain, Ashley was allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against her husband. This gave prosecutors enough evidence to charge Tracey Humphrey with first-degree murder.[6]\nTracey Humphrey's murder trial began in February 2006. As part of her plea deal, Ashley testified against her husband. Under oath, she testified how she waited hours for Sandee to get off work at the Green Iguana, and then followed her back to her Pinellas Park home, where she fired eight shots into her.[7]  Tracey Humphrey testified in his own defense, stating that the killing was Ashley's idea.[8] The jury did not find him convincing. He was convicted of first-degree murder on February 25, 2006.[5] Even though he faced the death penalty, jurors opted for life without parole, believing that it would be a harsher punishment than death in this case.[9]\nTracey Humphrey is serving his sentence at South Bay Correctional Facility in South Bay, Florida, Inmate Number: 930490. Post-conviction, he was sentenced to an additional 15 years for a pre-trial escape attempt in April 2004.[1]\nOn March 10, 2006, Ashley Humphrey was sentenced to 25 years for murder.[9] She is currently incarcerated at the Gadsden Correctional Facility in Quincy, Florida, Inmate Number: 154362.  She is scheduled to be released from prison on December 13, 2028; she will be 46 years old.[3]\nThis case has been profiled from various perspectives on Dateline NBC, 48 Hours, Vengeance: Killer Lovers, Snapped, and On the Case with Paula Zahn; Ashley was interviewed by FBI profiler Candice DeLong for an episode of DeLong's Investigation Discovery series, Facing Evil. On 13 July 2017, Killer Woman was shown on ITV with Piers Morgan interviewing Ashley.[citation needed] Homicide: Hours to Kill, season two, episode nine, also covered the case.\n",

He was incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison.\nIn 2020, Erskine became one of a dozen California death row inmates to die in the span of less than two months as the result of a COVID-19 outbreak at San Quentin State Prison.[2] He died on the same day as fellow death row inmate Manuel Machado Alvarez, who also died from COVID-19.[3]\nErskine grew up in southern California. When he was five years old, Erskine darted into traffic on the Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach and was hit by a station wagon. He remained in a coma for 60 hours. Although physically he appeared recovered, he frequently complained to his mother about headaches, and he experienced \"black-out\" moments where he could not remember what he was last doing. At the age of 10, he started molesting his 6-year-old sister, forcing her to perform oral sex upon him.[4]\nErskine soon began raping his friends, threatening to kill them if they told anybody.[5] Erskine attended Southwest Junior High School in San Diego, California and was placed in \"special classes\" for the emotionally disturbed. At 15, Erskine escaped from a juvenile detention facility, pulled a knife on a 13-year-old girl and raped her. The next morning, he assaulted a 27-year-old female jogger with a knife.[4]\nIn 1980, while on his way to interview for a camp counselor's position, Erskine beat a 14-year-old boy unconscious during an attempted rape. He also raped another inmate while imprisoned.  Erskine begged the San Diego judge at the time to spare him from adult prison. Despite his mother's pleas to send her son to a mental institution, Erskine was sentenced to four years in prison; he was paroled in 1984.[4]\nIn 1993, Erskine invited a woman, who was waiting for the bus, into his home and held her hostage for several days, repeatedly raping and sodomizing her before letting her go. He was quickly arrested. He was convicted of multiple charges, including rape and kidnapping, and sentenced to 70 years in prison. As a convicted sex offender, Erskine had to submit his DNA to a database.[4]\nIn March 2001, the San Diego Cold Case squad reopened the investigation of the unsolved 1993 murders of nine-year-old Jonathan Sellers and 13-year-old Charlie Keever. The police tested cotton swabs taken from Keever's mouth at the time of death, that contained semen. The DNA sample was entered into CODIS, and was matched to Erskine.[4]\nIn September 2003, Erskine went on trial for the two murders. The jurors were shown photos of the crime scene: Sellers was at the entrance of the makeshift fort hanging from a castor bean tree branch. He was naked from the waist down, his legs and arms bound with rope, and his mouth gagged. His genitals showed obvious signs of sexual assault, and a noose was tied around his neck. \nOn the ground lay Keever, his head resting on a pile of his and Sellers' clothes. He was also naked from the waist down, legs and arms bound, his mouth gagged, and his genitals were bleeding from extensive bite marks. He, too, had a rope around his neck. The pathologist determined Charlie Keever was alive when the bite marks were inflicted. Erskine's DNA was also found on two cigarette butts found near the bodies.\n",

        "paragraph": "James Bailey Cash Jr. (born August 2, 1932) was a five-year-old child from Princeton, Florida who was smothered to death during his kidnapping by Franklin Pierce McCall in 1938.\nMcCall successfully collected a large ransom for the dead child, having gone so far as to plant and publicly \"discover\" one of his own ransom notes, leading the authorities to detain him as a suspect. After several days of interrogation, McCall confessed to Cash's abduction and directed authorities to the hidden ransom money and the child's remains.\nDuring the 1930s, the United States experienced a series of \"ransom kidnappings\" committed explicitly for financial gain, with victims generally from either middle-class or wealthy families.[1][2] The most widely publicized ransom kidnapping at the time was the 1932 kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh Jr., the only son of the record-setting aviator Charles Lindbergh.[1][2] Like James Bailey Cash Jr., Lindbergh's son died during the abduction, but a ransom was sought nevertheless. The Lindbergh case inspired Congress to pass legislation that allowed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate kidnappings in any state under certain conditions, one of which was a ransom demand.[3] Despite this legislation, ransom kidnappings continued to be a major concern at the time when James Bailey Cash Jr. was abducted in May 1938.[4]\nOn the night of May 28, 1938, five-year-old James Bailey Cash Jr., nicknamed \"Skeegie\", was kidnapped in the middle of the night by Franklin Pierce McCall.[4] McCall was a local laborer and a former tenant of the Cash family.[5] After putting James Jr. to bed, sometime after 9:30 pm, his mother, Vera Cash locked up the house and left to meet her husband at the family-owned general store.[4] Sometime later, McCall entered the house and used a handkerchief to quiet the boy before taking him from the home, smothering him to death in the process.[6] McCall hid the boy's body about a half-mile away from his home.[4] By 10:10 PM, both parents returned home to find the boy missing and began to search the surrounding area. The search effort was later joined by neighbors and local Boy Scouts.[7][8]\nSoon after the murder, by 11:00 pm the same night, McCall began to intimidate John Emanuel and Geraldine Barnes, a local African American farming couple.[9] At first, McCall attempted to get Emanuel to speak with him and to deliver a letter to Bailey Cash, Cash Jr's father. Emanuel, however, refused and McCall threatened to shoot Emanuel before leaving.[10] The couple then left their home, to hide out at a friends home for safety.[11] Meanwhile, Beatrice Cash, a relative of John Baily Cash who lived in the same town, found a letter wrapped around the door knob on her front door, which instructed the reader to go to a specific house in Princeton's African American neighborhood where they would find further instructions.[12]\nThe note was addressed to J.B. Cash. Beatrice woke up her husband and drove over to the Cash residence to help with the search.[12] The house mentioned in the letter was the house belonging to Emanuel. By midnight the search was beginning to end, by now many of them were angry over the disappearance and by 1:00 AM, Bailey Cash and the rest of the family went over to Emanuel's house, surrounding it while Bailey and Asbury began to look for the note.[13] They soon found the note underneath the door of the house.[13] This note was the first of a series of ransom letters that the Cash family would receive.\nThe first note was composed of multiple sheets of paper with a series of demands written throughout:\nThe Cash family was to provide 10,000 dollars in various types of bills with serial numbers not in an order and deliver carry the money in a shoe box to Homestead, where they would drive along the road until they saw a flash two times, at which point they would leave the money on the roadside and continue the route. If Bailey complied, and kept the ransom secret, the note promised that John Baily Jr. would be safely returned.[14]\nBy 3:00 AM that morning, Special Agent Arthur Rutzen of the FBI had been contacted by a Dade County Sheriff, R.B. Eavanson.[15] They would meet up later at the Roberts Hotel at Miami Beach to further discuss the case. After their discussion another investigator, Samuel K. McKee, joined the case.  McKee and Rutzen went to the Cash home to continue the investigation.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "Paul Jennings Hill (February 6, 1954 \u2013 September 3, 2003) was an American minister and anti-abortion terrorist[1][2] who murdered physician John Britton and Britton's bodyguard, retired Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Barrett, in 1994. Hill was sentenced to death by lethal injection and was executed on September 3, 2003.\nPaul Hill was born in Miami, Florida, on February 6, 1954, to Oscar Jennings Hill, an airline pilot, and his wife Louise. He was raised in Coral Gables, Florida. At the age of 17, Hill was charged with the assault of his father when his parents attempted to get him treatment for his drug problem. Hill said he experienced a religious conversion two years later in 1973, after being sent to a military school.[3] Hill later enrolled in Belhaven University, where he met his future wife, Karen Demuth, with whom he had three children.\nHill graduated from Reformed Theological Seminary, where he studied under Greg Bahnsen, a founder of the right-wing Christian Reconstructionist movement.[4] He attended St. Paul Presbyterian Church, which espoused theonomy, a movement related to Reconstructionism.[5] Following his ordination in 1984, Hill became a minister affiliated with both the Presbyterian Church in America and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. He was excommunicated in 1993 following a number of nationally televised appearances in which he claimed to be the new national spokesperson for \"defensive action\" against abortion providers and claimed a connection to the Army of God.[6][7]\nOn July 29, 1994, Hill approached the Ladies Center, an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida. When he spotted clinic doctor John Britton and his bodyguard, retired USAF Lieutenant Colonel James H. Barrett,[8] outside the clinic, he fired on both of them at close range with a Mossberg Model 500A 12-gauge pump-action shotgun.[9] Both Britton and Barrett died; Barrett's wife, June, was also wounded. Following the shots, Hill laid his shotgun on the ground and waited to be arrested.\nFollowing his arrest, Hill was brought to trial in the Circuit Court of Florida for the First Circuit, charged with two counts of first-degree premeditated murder, one count of attempted first-degree murder, and one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle. Hill moved, successfully, to be allowed to appear pro se; i.e., he represented himself. He pleaded not guilty on all counts. Hill's motion to use the affirmative defense of justification was denied. According to Hill, his actions were a defensive act, rather than a retribution. On December 6, 1994, Hill was found guilty of the charges and was sentenced to death.[10] Appeals to the First District Court of Appeal, 656 So.2d 1271 (Fla. 1995), and subsequently to the Florida Supreme Court, 688 So.2d 901 (Fla.1996), were unsuccessful. Hill petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for writ of certiorari (asked the Court to hear his appeal). The petition was denied. 522 U.S. 907 (1997).\nThe execution warrant for Hill was not signed until July 2003, at which time it was signed by Governor Jeb Bush. Hill died by lethal injection in Florida State Prison on September 3, 2003, aged 49. His last words were, \"If you believe abortion is a lethal force, you should oppose the force and do what you have to do to stop it. May God help you to protect the unborn as you would want to be protected.\"[10]\nHill chose Rev. Donald Spitz as his spiritual adviser during the last week of his life.[11] Hill was close friends with Spitz both before and after he killed John Britton and James H. Barrett. Spitz was with Hill during the last week of his life and with Hill when he was executed.\nPrior to the murders, Hill sent two position papers to Reconstructionist author Gary North, which set out Hill's views of abortion and why he considered murder of abortionists to be warranted. The papers were followed by three additional letters to North in October 1994. North's responses, issued after the murders, comprised two letters that were made available to the public. The letters rejected and refuted Hill's theological arguments, and concluded that, \"...the public will regard your dual assassination as the act of a condemned man outside of God's church and acting on his own in defiance of Bible-revealed law and therefore also God's moral law.\"[12]\nHill spent almost a decade in prison awaiting his execution. In a statement made before his execution, Hill's views on the murders remained unchanged; he said that he felt no remorse for his actions, and that he expected \"a great reward in Heaven\".[10] Hill left behind a manuscript manifesto[13] which his backers promised him they would publish. Hill also encouraged others who believe abortion is an illegitimate use of lethal force to \"do what you have to do to stop it.\"[14][15]\n",

        "paragraph": "On 13 January 2014, retired SWAT American commander Curtis J. Reeves Jr.[1] shot and killed retired American Gulf War veteran Chad Oulson in a Cobb Theatres movie theater in Wesley Chapel, Florida, United States. The shooting occurred during the movie previews following a brief altercation between the two men. Reeves asked Oulson to turn off his cell phone and Oulson threw popcorn at Reeves.\nIn 2017, Reeves' legal team attempted to use Florida's stand-your-ground law as the basis of his defense, which was initially rejected by the court. In 2022, Reeves was acquitted of second-degree murder and aggravated battery.\nOn 13 January 2014,[2] Oulson and his wife Nicole, were preparing to watch the movie Lone Survivor while retired law enforcement officer Curtis Reeves and his wife were watching from the row behind the Oulsons.[3] Chad Oulson texted his daughter's babysitter; Reeves told Oulson to turn off his cellphone and to not use it in the theater. Reeves then exited the theater to complain to theater personnel, then returned to his seat. Chad Oulson threw popcorn at Reeves, who drew a .380 caliber handgun and fired, shooting Nicole Oulson in the finger[3] and fatally wounding Chad Oulson.[4][5]\nChad Oulson died later the same day, in hospital.[6]\nAccording to witness Alan Hamilton, an off-duty police officer, Reeves' wife said \"that was no cause to shoot anyone\", to which Reeves scolded her with his finger and said \"you shut your [expletive] mouth and don't say another word\".[7] Reeves insisted that he killed Chad Oulson because he felt threatened by the younger, more physically fit individual.[3] According to several sources, Reeves was also texting during the previews,[8][9] responding to a text from his son.[10]\nIn 2017, a judge ruled that Reeves could not take shelter under the Florida's Stand Your Ground law,[11] a decision that would later be overturned on appeal,[12] leaving the determination of self-defense to the jury. Tampa defense attorney Richard Escobar referred to the case as \"the largest self-defense case ever in Florida\".[13]\nEight years after the event, in February 2022, Reeves was acquitted of second-degree murder and aggravated battery.[6] During the trial, Reeves stated that the confrontation made him more afraid than anything else in his life, including his SWAT experience[14] and entire law enforcement career, others refuted that statement.[15] Officers on the scene described Reeves' demeanor as extremely calm.[16]\nIn 2022, the Oulson Family Foundation was established to provide funds for children who have been affected by gun violence, including counseling, medical attention, and college tuition.[17][18]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJerry Michael \"Mike\" Williams (October 16, 1969[2] \u2013 December 16, 2000) was an American murder victim. Initially, it was said he left his home in Tallahassee, Florida, United States, to go duck hunting. After subsequent investigations, he was presumed to have drowned in Lake Seminole, a large reservoir located in the southwest corner of Georgia along its border with Florida; investigators later came to suspect he had been the victim of foul play, possibly at another location.[3] His body was found in October 2017 near Tallahassee,[4] and Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) officials confirmed Williams was a victim of homicide.[5]\nAfter Williams's boat was found abandoned on the lake, the initial theory was that he had fallen out of it after a collision. However, a lengthy and exhaustive search of the lake bed in the area failed to find his body: at that time, it was the only known occasion when no remains or body had been discovered after a drowning death in the lake.[6] It was eventually concluded that his body had been eaten by alligators. After waders and a jacket containing Williams's hunting license were found in the lake six months later, he was declared legally dead, following a court petition by his widow, Denise. She went on to marry Brian Winchester, a mutual friend who had helped her take out a large life insurance policy on Williams shortly before his disappearance.\nSome investigators felt aspects of the case were not consistent with the alligator theory. After years of pressure from Williams's mother, Cheryl, the case was reopened in 2004 by the FDLE. By then, officers had learned that alligators do not, in fact, eat during the winter months, as the water is too cold, and as such, it was suspected that foul play might have occurred. But it did not produce any new evidence, as the potential crime scene had not been secured during the search for Williams.\nCheryl Williams wrote letters daily to the governor, asking him to have the state reopen the investigation even though two later investigations were likewise unable to uncover any significant new information, alienating many of the law enforcement officials she had previously persuaded to reopen it.[7][8] The Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared devoted an episode to the case in 2012.[9] In 2016, Winchester was arrested on charges stemming from an incident where he allegedly kidnapped Denise, the missing man's widow, who was now divorcing him;[10] he was sentenced to 20 years in prison on the day before the FDLE announced that Williams's body had been found. In May 2018, Denise Williams was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and accessory.[11] She was found guilty that December, after Winchester testified to shooting Michael at Denise's behest when their original plan to stage a boating accident failed, and was sentenced to life in prison in January of 2019.[12] In 2020, a Florida appellate court overturned her murder conviction but upheld her murder conspiracy conviction, for which she will serve 30 years.\nJerry Michael Williams was known as Michael or Mike. He grew up in Bradfordville[6] (north of Tallahassee), the son of a Greyhound bus driver[3] and a day care provider who raised him and his older brother Nick in a double-wide trailer. Instead of building a house, the parents saved their money so both boys, who helped by working nights at supermarkets, could attend North Florida Christian High School. There Mike excelled, serving as student council president, playing football and being active in the Key Club. At the age of 15, he began duck hunting as a hobby, and also came to know fellow student Denise Merrell.[13]\nAfter North Florida Christian, he attended Florida State University, where he majored in political science and urban planning.[14] Before graduation, he was hired by Ketcham Appraisal Group as a property appraiser. He distinguished himself as \"the hardest-working man I ever saw\", according to the company's owner. After he married Merrell in 1994, he would often go home for dinner and return to work after she (and later, his daughter as well) went to bed, and he sometimes went into work after going duck hunting in the morning.[13] According to his mother, Mike was making US$200,000 annually by the time of his disappearance.[15] He and Denise had bought a home in a small upscale subdivision on the east side of the city.[2]\nIn 1999, Williams's only child, a daughter, was born. His coworkers said he was as devoted to her as he was to his work. The following year his father died. Midway through the year, the couple bought a $1 million life insurance policy on him through Brian Winchester,[6] a childhood acquaintance of Merrell who had also become best friends with her husband. Later that year, Williams told his mother, whom he had been consoling, that he would have liked to have $50,000 to take the next year off.[3]\nTwo days before his disappearance, Mike and Denise told his mother, as well as his brother Nick, that they were planning to have another child soon. In 2001, she said, they were planning to go on a cruise in Hawaii that spring; later in the year he expected to travel to Jamaica for work as well.[13]\n",

        "paragraph": "Escambia High School is a high school located in Escambia County, Florida, United States.\nEscambia High School opened for the 1958\u201359 school year, and its first graduating class in 1959 was composed of 207\u00a0students. A large number of the first EHS students came from Pensacola High School.[2] It was opened as an all-white segregated school with a school song of Dixie and a Rebel mascot. In 1969 the federal government forced the integration of the school. In 2018, the school censored the yearbook, purging a section on school history to remove all mention of racism in the schools past.[3]\n\"The Pride\"- Escambia's Marching band has been known throughout the area for its unique shows, currently led by the Director of Bands,Doug Holsworth. The assistant director is Dustin Hicklen. Past Halftime shows include selections from Beethoven (Simply called \"Beethoven\"), music from the Halo video games, the famous \"Take Five\" and \"Blue Rondo Al A Turk\" by The Dave Brubeck Quartet to celebrate Escambia's 50th Anniversary, \"Magnum Opus\" by the progressive rock band Kansas (along with and interlude of \"Carry on, Wayward Son), \"Roundabout\" based on the song from the band Yes, and a conglomerate of works including the popular \"Count Bubba\", the unusual \"Hunting Wabbits\", \"Ever Braver, Ever Stronger\"-for which, the show is named, \"Sing, Sang, Sung\", and Mueva Los Huesos (or, \"Shake Your Bones\") by the modern jazz composer, Gordon Goodwin.\n\"The Diamonds\"- An Indoor Drumline that compete at the regional WGI competitions, and in the World Championships in Dayton, Ohio. The director is Terry Sanders.\nThey also have a chorus. In the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of Choral Director Phyllis Merritt, the Rebelaires (the school's select chorus, later renamed the Escambians) were recognized across the state, the country and the world for their exceptional choral sound and their outstanding performances of serious choral music.\nEscambia High School is also known for its orchestra program. Under the direction of Virginia Clark, this strings program consistently produces the top string musicians in the county and state.\nEscambia's NJROTC program, which was the first NJROTC unit, ranks among the nation's most prestigious units, with Athletic, Academic, Drill, Color guard, Orienteering, and Air Rifle teams. At the end of the 2010\u20132011 school year, the Gators had attained another Distinguished Unit Award, the title of Number 1 in Area 8 (Northwest Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Arkansas), and well as Number 1 in the nation as of 2013\u20132014 school year. For the 2011\u201312 year, the Gators had also attained a Distinguished Unit Award and were once again the Number 1 Unit in Area 8. The unit is currently under the instruction of Commander Christopher Benjamin, Sergeant Major Andre Francis, and Chief Xavier King.\nThe Escambia High School riots were racially motivated nonviolent and violent demonstrations which occurred in varying forms between 1972 and 1977 at the then-newly desegregated Escambia High School. The centerpiece riot, which received the most publicity and was the most violent demonstration, occurred on February 5, 1976.\nFormerly an all-white school, Escambia High School was forcibly desegregated in 1969. However, the first black student, son of an active duty military officer, had enrolled in 1965 and attended Escambia without any incident whatsoever for approximately one year. He was welcomed into the student body by the school administration, and was assigned an escort to introduce him to the white students. He made friends quickly, was well-received, and attended until his father received orders and transferred. Several years later, in the fall of 1972, black students rioted at a home football game for their team, whose mascot was a \"Rebel,\" modeled in appearance after the Colonel Reb of the University of Mississippi. The school band played the official school song, \"Dixie,\" and it was from there that the violence ensued.[4] Continuing until the end of the 1972\u201373 academic year, blacks and other students protested the mascot, school song and use of the Confederate Flag, which was flown at school events and games, on the grounds that the imagery the items brought up were insensitive to black people. On July 24, 1973, a United States District Court ruling deemed all of the aforementioned symbols as \"racially irritating\" and barred their use at the school level (Augustus v. School Board of Escambia County, 361 F. Supp. 383, 1973).[5] At the beginning of the next school year, the name \"Raiders\" was picked to be the new name for all of Escambia High's athletic teams. Throughout 1974, the Escambia County School District appealed the decision, and on January 25, 1975, the United States Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the school board, overturning the injunction and decreeing that the school board should be in charge of the matter (Augustus v. School Board of Escambia County, 507 F.2d 152, 1975).[5]\n",

Between 1915 and 1924, the self-styled \"King of the Everglades\" or \"Swamp Bandit\" operated from various hideouts in the Florida Everglades. His gang robbed nearly $1 million from at least 40 banks while at the same time hijacking numerous shipments of illegal whiskey being smuggled into the state from the Bahamas. Indeed, Ashley's gang was so effective that rum-running on the Florida coast virtually ceased while the gang was active. His two-man raid on the West End in the Bahamas in 1924 marked the first time in over a century that American pirates had attacked a British Crown colony.\nAmong poor Florida \"crackers\", he was considered a folk hero who represented a symbol of resistance to bankers, lawmen and wealthy landowners. Ashley's activities also hindered Prohibition bootleggers in major cities, whose importation of foreign liquor undermined local moonshiners. Even the newspapers of the era frequently compared him to Jesse James. Almost every major crime in Florida was blamed on Ashley and his gang and one Florida official called him the greatest threat to the state since the Seminole Wars. His near 13-year feud with Palm Beach County Sheriff George B. Baker ended in the death of Ashley and his three lieutenants in 1924.\nJohn Ashley was born and raised in the backwoods country along the Caloosahatchee River in the community of Buckingham, Florida near Fort Myers, Florida. He was one of nine children born to Joe Ashley, a poor Florida woodsman, who made his living by fishing, hunting, and trapping otters. The Ashley family moved from Fort Myers to Pompano in the 1890s where Joe Ashley and his older sons worked on the new railroad being built by industrialist Henry Flagler.[1] In 1911, Joe moved his family to West Palm Beach and briefly served as county sheriff. John Ashley spent much of his youth in the Florida Everglades and, like his father, became a skilled trapper and alligator hunter.[2]\nOn December 29, 1911, a dredging crew working near Lake Okeechobee discovered the body of Seminole trapper Desoto Tiger. An investigation was held and John Ashley soon came under suspicion. According to fellow Seminole Jimmy Gopher, Ashley had been last seen with Desoto traveling in a canoe together with a boatload of otter hides to sell at a local market. Authorities were later told by fur traders in Miami, the Girtman Brothers, that John Ashley had sold them the hides for $1,200;[1] the previous day he had also been arrested in West Palm Beach on a charge of \"recklessly displaying firearms\". Two deputies, S.A. Barfield and Bob Hannon, found Ashley camping in a palmetto thicket near Hobe Sound and attempted to take him into custody. However, they were surprised by his brother Bob Ashley and were disarmed at gunpoint. John Ashley then sent the officers back with a message for Sheriff George B. Baker \"not to send anymore chicken-hearted men with rifles or they are apt to get hurt\".[2][3][4]\nIn his trial for the murder of Desoto Tiger in 1910, despite overwhelming evidence, Ashley was not convicted. In a second trial in 1915, he was sentenced to hang for Tiger's murder, but that conviction was overturned by the Florida Supreme Court.[5] Ashley repeatedly escaped from various local jails and eluded law enforcement until he was gunned down at the Sebastian river bridge at Roseland.[6] Although he was incarcerated for other crimes, Ashley never served any time for the murder of Desoto Tiger.[7]\nWhen the Seminole Nation raised protest over the murder, the US federal government threatened to intervene. John Ashley fled to New Orleans for a year or two before returning to Florida around 1914.[6] He may have worked as a logger in Seattle and later claimed to have robbed a bank in Canada. Upon his return, he surrendered himself to authorities in West Palm Beach where he was imprisoned until his trial. Ashley may have hoped that a hometown jury might sympathize with him, however the local prosecutor petitioned the judge for a change of venue to Miami. Hearing of the prosecutor's plans, he decided to escape.[1] According to contemporary accounts, Ashley was being escorted to his cell by Sheriff Baker's son, Robert C. Baker, when he suddenly broke away, ran out an unlocked door and climbed a 10-foot fence to freedom.[3][4]\nHe and his brothers then became outlaws and, with other occasional partners, formed a criminal gang. In 1915, he and Bob Ashley robbed an FEC passenger train with Chicago mobster Kid Lowe. Their first attempt was less than successful as they failed to agree on who would collect valuables from the passengers and who would rob the mail car. That same year, they stole $45,000 in silver and cash in a daring daylight bank robbery in Stuart, Florida. During their getaway however, Lowe accidentally shot John Ashley in the jaw, costing him the sight in one of his eyes.[6][8] When Ashley attempted to get medical attention for his eye, he was captured and held in the Dade County jailhouse to await trial.[2][3] He was taken to Miami to stand trial for the murder of Desoto Tiger. However, the state's attorney believed that that had a better chance of prosecuting Ashley for the Stuart robberies in West Palm Beach.[3][4]\nOn June 2, 1915, Bob Ashley attempted to break his brother John out of jail. Entering the jailer's house, Bob Ashley shot Deputy Sheriff Wilber W. Hendrickson at point-blank range[8][9] and left with his jail keys. He then ran from the house to the garage where gang members had left him a getaway car. When he found he was unable to drive the particular car left for him, he attempted to force several men at gunpoint to drive the car for him. Each of the men claimed to not know how to drive the car either so Bob Ashley jumped on the running board of a passing truck and forced the driver, T.H. Duckett, to take him out of town. A deputy, officer J.R. Riblet, spotted Ashley and gave chase. When the truck suddenly stalled in the middle of the street, a shootout occurred resulting in the deaths of both Bob Ashley and Riblet.[2][4][6][8][10] Angered by Bob's killing spree, several thousand Miami residents threatened the jailhouse and talked of lynching John Ashley in his cell. It was only after police paraded the body of Bob Ashley through the streets that the mob dispersed.[1][3]\nKid Lowe, possibly out of guilt for shooting John Ashley, sent a note to Dade County sheriff Dan Hardie demanding the release of Ashley:\n",

        "paragraph": "Melinda Duckett (n\u00e9e Eubank; August 14, 1985 \u2013 September 8, 2006) was the mother of Trenton John Duckett, a 2-year-old boy who disappeared from his Leesburg, Florida, home on August 27, 2006. She attracted media attention when she committed suicide following an appearance on Nancy Grace. Duckett's family filed a wrongful death claim against Nancy Grace and CNN, alleging that the aggressive questioning traumatized Duckett and led to her suicide.[1]\nDuckett was born in South Korea and moved to the United States on Christmas Eve of 1985, at the age of four months, after being adopted by an American couple.[2] She lived in Lockport, New York until she was seventeen years old, when she moved to Florida to live with her adoptive grandparents.[3] She attended South Sumter High School with Joshua Duckett, whom she began dating.[4] Melinda became pregnant, and gave birth to Trenton shortly after graduating high school. She and Joshua married in July 2005. The relationship between Josh and Melinda Duckett was \u201ctumultuous\u201d and they separated numerous times before Melinda filed for divorce in July 2006.[5]\nMelinda was involuntarily committed under the Baker Act in April 2005 after Joshua alleged that she had threatened to harm Trenton.[6] She was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder in December 2005, but the report indicated there was \"no psychological reason that would preclude Melinda from being a capable and loving parent.\"[7]\nDuckett worked for a lawn care company until she was laid off.[8] She became a notary public on August 1, 2006.[9]\nDuckett reported her son missing on August 27, 2006. She told police that she went to check on Trenton in his bedroom after she had finished watching a film, and discovered that Trenton was gone and there was a cut in the window screen above the crib.[8] According to police, she was considered the prime suspect in her son's disappearance but no arrests were made because they hoped she would lead them to Trenton.[10]\nDuckett was interviewed about Trenton's disappearance by Nancy Grace for a September 8, 2006, episode of Grace's television program. During the interview Grace accused Duckett of hiding something because Duckett refused to take a polygraph test and provided vague answers to questions.[11] The day after the taping of the show, Duckett wrote a two page letter addressed to \"the public\" expressing her love for Trenton and anger over being faced with \"ridicule and criticism.\" She left the letter on the dashboard of her car, entered her grandparents' home, retrieved her grandfather's shotgun, entered a closet and died by suicide by firearm.[10]\nDuckett's family blamed her death on media scrutiny, particularly from Grace. They filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her, accusing Grace of inflicting emotional distress on Duckett.[12] In an interview on Good Morning America, Nancy Grace said in reaction to events that \"If anything, I would suggest that guilt made her commit suicide. To suggest that a 15- or 20-minute interview can cause someone to commit suicide is focusing on the wrong thing.\"[11] She then said that, while she sympathized with the family, she knew from her own experience as a victim of crime that such people look for somebody else to blame.[13]\nOn November 8, 2010, a month before the jury trial was scheduled to start, Grace reached a settlement with the estate of Melinda Duckett to create a $200,000 trust fund dedicated to locating Trenton. According to the agreement, if Trenton is found alive before he turns 13, the remaining proceeds in the trust will be administered by a trustee, Trenton's great-aunt Kathleen Calvert, until he turns 18 and the funds are transferred for his use. If Trenton is not found alive by his 13th birthday, the funds will be transferred to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. \"We are pleased the lawsuit has been dismissed. The statement speaks for itself,\" a spokeswoman for CNN said.[14] Jay Paul Deratany, a lawyer representing Duckett's family and estate, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press: \"After four years of litigation and extensive discovery, the parties now agree that Nancy Grace, the producers of her program, and CNN engaged in no intentional wrongdoing in the course of dedicating a program to finding the missing toddler, as alleged in the lawsuit.\"[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nVince \"Trapper\" Nelson (born Vincent Nostokovich or Natulkiewicz; 1909\u20131968) was an American trapper, hunter and zoo founder. Though he was born in New Jersey, and lived in Mexico and Texas, Nelson is best known for establishing a homestead-turned-zoo on the shore of Florida's Loxahatchee River. Filled with exotic and wild animals, his zoo was a popular tourist spot in the 1940s and 1950s, visited by local and national celebrities. Because of this, he became known locally as \"Tarzan of the Loxahatchee\".\nThe zoo was eventually shut down by state health inspectors in 1960. After his zoo was closed, Nelson became a hermit and suffered from undiagnosed health problems. In 1968, he was found dead from a gunshot wound in his cabin by a friend. His death was ruled a suicide. Nelson's campsite is now known as the Trapper Nelson Zoo Historic District in Jonathan Dickinson State Park, Hobe Sound, Florida.\nThe Historical Society of Palm Beach County, in the article \"Vincent \"Trapper Nelson\" Natulkiewicz\", claims \"Vincent Natulkiewicz was born in Trenton, New Jersey about 1908.\"[1] Vincent Natulkiewicz was born to Casimer and Christine Natulkiewicz, in Trenton New Jersey in 1908, per grand-niece, Cynthia Celmer Tomassetti. As a boy, to earn money he began trapping animals such as muskrats in the marshes of New Jersey.[2] \nHis parents did not speak English, so Nelson would often assist them in translating to make sure they were not taken advantage of. However, when his mother died and his father remarried, Nelson ran away from home, heading west.[2][3]\nHopping freight trains, Nelson first ended up in Colorado, then eventually in Mexico.[2][3][4] While there, he was arrested by the Federales under suspicion of gunrunning. He spent time in a Mexican jail and was later released. Nelson later claimed his release was because he \"wrecked their food budget.\"[4]\nAfter his release Nelson headed back east with 10\u00a0cents to his name. He made money for food by gambling with other road bums until he made it to South Florida, where he, his step brother Charles Nelson and friend John Dykas set up camp.[2]\nNelson and his partners settled on the beach by the Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the late 1920s.[5] Bessie DuBois, wife of John DuBois, recalled seeing him for the first time in 1927 or 1928.[3] The DuBoises owned a restaurant that Nelson would frequent, and Bessie made note of his eccentric eating habits: \"He would order a pie\u2014not a piece of pie, mind you, but a pie\u2014and he'd eat the whole thing right in front of me.\"[3] He ate ice cream by the half-gallon, and there were stories that he once ate 18 eggs for breakfast.[4]\nThings did not stay peaceful for long. On December 17, 1931, Charles Nelson shot partner John Dykas in the back, killing him.[1] Trapper Nelson, angered by his step-brother's actions, testified against him at the trial for Dykas' murder. Charles was given a 20-year sentence at Raiford Prison.[2] Disillusioned with civilization, Nelson withdrew from the beach, settling deep in the woods on the Loxahatchee River that same December.[3] Using what little money he had and money borrowed from his sister, he bought 800\u00a0acres.[5]\nPhysically imposing at 6'\u00a04\" and 240\u00a0pounds, he lived by trapping, hunting, and fishing in what was then wild country. He made money by selling the furs of the animals he trapped, and ate the meat, starting rumors that he ate everything from opossums to stray house cats.[3] He acquired extensive land holdings,[6] bidding on tax auctions during the Great Depression. He would on occasion bid against Judge C. E. Chillingworth, the judge who had handed down his step-brother's sentence, and the two eventually became friends.[4] When Chillingworth was murdered in the 1950s, Charles Nelson was briefly considered a suspect.[4]\n",

In 1969 she became the second woman to be placed on the list of FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives.[1]\nArrington was originally sentenced to death for the murder of Vivian Ritter, a legal secretary who worked in Leesburg, Florida for a public defender who unsuccessfully represented her two children on felony charges. Arrington escaped from prison in 1969 while awaiting execution by cutting through a window screen and fleeing in her pajamas.\nAfter she was caught, she was sentenced in 1972 to 10 additional years for escape, but her death sentence was commuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down capital punishment as unconstitutional in Furman v. Georgia (1972).[2]\nArrington died on May 10, 2014 in Lowell Correctional Institution in Marion County, Florida, the same institution from which she escaped. She was 80 years old.[2]\nArrington's first conviction occurred in 1964, for the killing of her husband Lester \u201cJack\u201d Arrington. Jack, 34, was a former policeman and a bouncer at a nightclub in Miami. Jack was killed on July 4, 1964 on Bethune Beach. Arrington turned herself in the following day, confessing to shooting her husband. During the trial Arrington claimed that the shooting was an accident while her lawyer claimed self-defense, as Jack had become violent with her while the two were arguing in their car. This resulted in her shooting him. Nathaniel Powers, a witness at the scene, told police that he broke the couple up after he saw Jack choking her in the front seat of the car. As the police were unable to locate the weapon Arrington was found guilty of manslaughter instead of more severe charges and sentenced to twenty years in prison. Arrington would later admit in a 2012 interview that she had buried the gun with her husband.[3]\nArrington had two children, a son and daughter. In 1967 her son, Lloyd Dean, robbed a gas station with a friend in Leesburg, Florida.[4] No one was hurt and $60 was stolen. Her son was represented by public attorney Bob Pierce, who advised him to plead guilty. Dean was sentenced to life in prison in 1968 at the age of 18, while his friend only received probation. Pierce had also represented Arrington's daughter on unrelated fraud charges, which resulted in the daughter receiving jail time as well.[5][6]\nThis enraged Arrington, who felt that Pierce did not fairly represent Dean.[5][2] On April 22, 1968, while out on an appeal bond for her manslaughter conviction, Arrington went to Pierce\u2019s office in Leesburg with the intention of killing him. Once there she discovered that Pierce was not at his office. Arrington then abducted his secretary, Vivian Ritter, which raised tensions within the town. Searches were conducted for Ritter and a psychic was consulted to help find the secretary.[7] Her car was discovered two days after her disappearance, bloodstained. The body of Ritter, who had three children, was found three days later in the woods near State road 44, several miles away from Leesburg. She had been shot and run over with her own car repeatedly.[2][8][9]\nPrior to her capture Arrington burgled the home of Judge Troy Hall, who had given her son his life sentence.[2] When she was captured investigators discovered several notes in her room and in her clothing. The notes threatened to kill the wife of Hall and to dismember Ritter if law officers did not back off and release her children from jail.[10][2]\nDuring the trial multiple witnesses testified against Arrington, linking her to the crime. A taxi driver reported dropping off Arrington half a block away from Pierce's office on the morning of April 22. Arrington's landlady stated that she had lent her a .22 caliber which was never returned to her and was later found to be the gun used to kill Ritter.[11] On December 6, 1968 Arrington was sentenced to death for first degree murder.[12]\n",

Around 7:30\u00a0p.m., four teenage boys (Leland Brunson, Jordan Davis, Tommie Stornes, and Tevin Thompson) stopped at a Gate Petroleum gas station. Stornes left his red Dodge Durango SUV running while he went into the store. Brunson, Davis, and Thompson remained in the vehicle listening to music which was described as \"very loud.\" Dunn, driving a black Volkswagen Jetta sedan, and his fianc\u00e9e Rhonda Rouer pulled into the right adjacent parking spot.[8] Rouer left their car to purchase white wine and chips.[9] She testified that Dunn told her \"I hate that thug music,\" before she left the car for the store, though Dunn claims he used the phrase \"rap crap.\"[10][11]\nThe bass from the loud music playing in the teens' SUV annoyed Dunn, who asked for it to be turned down.[9][12] The front seat passenger, Tevin Thompson, initially complied and turned the volume down, but Jordan Davis requested the volume be turned back up.[13][14]\nDavis' protests continued and an independent witness overheard Dunn say \"No, you're not gonna talk to me that way.\" Dunn, who had a concealed weapons permit,[8] took a handgun out of his glove compartment and started firing at Davis' door, hitting him in the legs, lungs, and aorta. As the SUV backed up to evade his gunshots, Dunn opened his own door and continued firing at the car in shooter's stance, as the boys ducked for cover. Dunn later testified that he still feared for his safety as well as that of Rouer who was to return to the vehicle imminently.[15]\n",

Lewis, made a 911 call stating that she had found her daughter in the family's pool and she was not breathing.[2] Emergency personnel rushed Adrianna to the nearby hospital Bay Medical,[3] where she was pronounced dead about an hour after arrival. The death was initially treated as an accident until Adrianna's half-brother A.J., then 6 years old, told police that he had witnessed his mother \"dunk\" Adrianna in the pool as a form of corporal punishment.[4]\nDuring the investigation, police discovered that Adrianna had been diagnosed with ADHD and Lewis stated that while she initially had trouble bonding with her daughter, her affection for Adrianna had grown over time.[4] Investigators also found that neither Adrianna nor A.J. appeared to have any toys in the house, to which Lewis stated that the toys had been taken away for a week as a form of punishment and that the toys were stored in a shed. After searching the shed, investigators noted that there were no toys in the shed or any evidence to suggest that they had been there. There was a little red wagon and two inflatable toys for the pool in the yard but no other toys.[4] Dr. Renee Fox, the emergency room physician who had handled Adrianna's medical care, informed investigators that Lewis had not shown any emotion or reaction when informed that her daughter had died, which she had found odd.[3] Lewis submitted to and passed a lie detector test where she claimed that she had not killed her daughter.[5][4] In September 2007, Lewis was arrested and charged with the first-degree murder of Adrianna.[6] She was offered a plea bargain that would have required her to plead guilty to manslaughter and receive a ten-year sentence, which she declined in favor of going to trial.\nLewis went to trial in February 2008,[7] where the statements by A.J. and Dr. Fox were brought up as evidence and the defense argued that A.J. was not a reliable witness, as his story had changed several times during further questioning.[8] Other evidence brought to trial included an autopsy performed by Dr. Charles Siebert, statements from Lewis's co-workers, evidence of poor housekeeping, and the lack of toys, including Lewis's statement over the toys' whereabouts.[9] The prosecution also pointed out multiple bruises on Adrianna's forehead that correlated with A.J.'s testimony.[4] Four days after the case went to trial and after only two hours (including lunch) of deliberation, the jury found Lewis guilty of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.[10] In March of the same year, Lewis was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[8]\nIn 2010 Lewis filed an appeal, referring to the Merger doctrine, which she claimed \"precludes the use of aggravated child abuse as the underlying felony in a felony murder charge if only a single act of abuse led to the child's death\". This appeal was unsuccessful, and the conviction was affirmed.[11]\nThree television shows have highlighted this case: the Investigation Discovery show True Crime with Aphrodite Jones, an episode of 20/20, What A.J. Saw: Mother's Fate Hinged on 7-Year-Old's Testimony,[4][9] and also an episode of the UK documentary series Killer Women with Piers Morgan.[12]\n",

Leroy Adams, a prominent white doctor and state senator\u2013elect. The judge restricted her testimony,[citation needed] but she testified as to their sexual relationship and his paternity of her child.[citation needed] The judge prohibited her from recounting her allegations that Adams had repeatedly raped her, and forced her to bear his children.[citation needed] She was sentenced to death for his murder by an all-white jury.[citation needed] The sensational case was covered widely in the United States press (including a press report written by Zora Neale Hurston, as well as by international papers). McCollum was subjected to a gag order. Her case was appealed and overturned by the State Supreme Court.[citation needed]\nBefore the second trial, McCollum was examined and found mentally incompetent to stand trial. She was committed to the state mental hospital (Florida State Hospital) at Chattahoochee, Florida. In 1974 her attorney, Frank Cannon, obtained her release under the Baker Act, as she was not considered a danger to herself or others.[citation needed]\nIn the 21st century, McCollum and her case received renewed attention, with books and four film documentaries exploring the issues of race, class, sexual violence, gender, and corruption in local politics from a modernist perspective.[opinion][citation needed] McCollum's case is considered a landmark trial by these people in the struggle for civil rights as they believe she was the first black woman to testify against a white man's sexual abuse and paternity of their child.[citation needed][by whom?] It is considered to have helped change attitudes about the practice of \"paramour rights\u201d.[1] McCollum's attorney, Releford McGriff, became part of a team who worked to change Florida's Jim Crow practice of selecting all-white juries. (Black people were still disenfranchised at that time and thus not eligible to serve as jurors, who were limited to voters.)[citation needed]\nRuby Jackson was born in 1909 to Gertrude and William Jackson in Zuber, Florida. She was the second child and first daughter among her six siblings. They attended local segregated schools. Ruby's parents recognized her intelligence and sent her to a private school, Fessenden Academy, where she excelled in bookkeeping.[citation needed]\nIn 1931 Ruby Jackson married Sam McCollum. They moved to Nyack, New York, as part of the Great Migration of rural blacks out of the South in the early 20th century. The couple had three children together: Sam Jr., Sonja, and Kay.[2] McCollum later said that a fourth and youngest, Loretta, was a biracial child fathered by Dr. C. Leroy Adams in a forced relationship.[3]\nIn 1934, the couple relocated to the area of Fort Myers, Florida. Sam's brother, Buck McCollum, had amassed considerable wealth managing a Bolita gambling business. Sam went into business with him and was reported to be a player in North Florida crime, including gambling and liquor sales. These were illegal in the county, but flourished because of payoffs to local law enforcement. In a related sideline, the McCollums also sold burial policies and owned a local funeral home. By the 1940s and early 1950s, the McCollums were reported to have \"amassed a fortune.\" based of their criminal activities.[3]\nSam and Ruby owned a \"stately, two-story home,\" in Live Oak, Florida, a small town of 4,000 people, which they acquired from the prior bolita operator in the county when he was run out of town. Ruby McCollum drove a new Chrysler automobile each year. The McCollums owned several \"jooks\" (juke joint), served illegal liquor, collected money from the juke boxes, and had a farm outside of town with the largest tobacco allotment in Florida. It was at this time that Ruby developed an addiction to heroin. The McCollums also owned a farm near Lake City, where Sam stocked fields with quail for hunting with his prized bird dogs.[citation needed]\nRuby McCollum was described as the wealthiest Black woman in town.[by whom?]The couple was considered financially successful and well respected in the community, where they contributed liberally to their church.[3] Their son and oldest child, Sam Jr., had started college at UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) by 1952.[4]\n",

Orlando Police officers shot and killed him after a three-hour standoff.\nIn a 9-1-1 call made shortly after the shooting began, Mateen swore allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and said the U.S. killing of Abu Waheeb in Iraq the previous month \"triggered\" the shooting.[2] He later told a negotiator he was \"out here right now\" because of the American-led interventions in Iraq and in Syria and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop the bombing. The incident was deemed a terrorist attack by FBI investigators.\nPulse was hosting a \"Latin Night\", and most of the victims were Latino. It is the deadliest incident in the history of violence against LGBT people in the United States, and was the deadliest mass shooting by a single gunman in U.S. history until the 2017 Las Vegas shooting.\nOn June 11, 2016, Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was hosting \"Latin Night\", a weekly Saturday night event drawing a primarily Latino crowd.[3][4] RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race contestant and drag queen Kenya Michaels is recorded to have been performing right as the shooting began (Michaels survived the shooting).[5] About 320 people were still inside the club, which was serving last call drinks at around 2:00 a.m. EDT on June 12.[6][7] At around the same time, Omar Mateen arrived at the club via rental van, parking it in the parking lot of a neighboring car shop.[1][8] He got out and walked toward the building armed with a SIG Sauer MCX[9] semi-automatic rifle and a 9mm Glock\u00a017 semi-automatic pistol.[10][11][12][13] He was wearing a green, blue, and white plaid dress shirt, a white T-shirt underneath, and tan cargo pants.[1] At 2:02 a.m., Mateen bypassed Officer Adam Gruler, a uniformed off-duty Orlando Police Department (OPD) officer working extra duty[14][15] as a security guard, entered the building through its southern entrance, and began shooting patrons.[1][6][7][16] Dozens were killed or severely injured inside the crowded nightclub, either directly or by ricochets.[1][17]\nGruler took cover and called in a signal for assistance. He told a post-incident Police Foundation assessment team that he had immediately recognized that his handgun would be severely disadvantaged against the rifle Mateen was using.[1] When he witnessed Mateen shooting two patrons attempting to escape through an emergency exit, Gruler fired shots at him.[1][16][18] In response, Mateen withdrew back into the nightclub and continued shooting victims as he traversed through the building, sometimes firing into bodies without checking whether they were already dead.[1] When additional officers arrived at the nightclub beginning at 2:04\u00a0a.m., Gruler shouted \"[The gunman]'s in the patio!\" and resumed firing at Mateen a minute later.[1][15][19] Two officers joined Gruler in engaging Mateen, who then retreated farther into the nightclub and \"began a 'hostage situation'\" in one of the bathrooms.[1][6][20][21] In less than five minutes, Mateen had fired approximately 200 rounds, pausing only to reload.[1]\nDuring the shooting, some of the people trapped inside the club sought help by calling or sending text messages to friends and relatives. Initially, some of them thought the gunshots were firecrackers or part of the music.[22][23][24] Imran Yousuf, a recently discharged Marine Corps veteran working as a nightclub bouncer immediately recognized the sounds as gunfire, which he described as \"high caliber\", and jumped over a locked door behind which dozens of people were hidden and paralyzed by fear, then opened a latched door behind them, allowing approximately 70 people to escape.[25][26] Many described a scene of panic and confusion caused by the loud music and darkness. One person shielded herself by hiding inside a bathroom and covering herself with bodies. A bartender said she took cover beneath the glass bar. At least one patron tried to help those who were hit.[27] According to a man trapped inside a bathroom with fifteen other patrons, Mateen fired sixteen times into the bathroom, through the closed door, killing at least two and wounding several others.[28]\nAccording to one of the hostages, Mateen entered a bathroom in the nightclub's northwest side and opened fire on the people hiding there, wounding several. The hostage, who had taken cover inside a stall with others, was injured by two bullets and struck with flying pieces of a wall hit by stray bullets. Shortly after entering the women's restroom, Mateen's rifle jammed. He then discarded the rifle and switched to his Glock\u00a017 pistol.[29][30][31] Two survivors quoted Mateen as saying, \"I don't have a problem with black people\",[32][33] and that he \"wouldn't stop his assault until America stopped bombing his country\".[34] Other survivors heard Mateen claim he had explosives as well as snipers stationed around the club.[35]\nPatrons trapped inside called or texted 9-1-1 to warn of the possible presence of explosives.[36]\n",

His grandfather, Josiah Belden, was an early California pioneer who made millions in San Francisco real estate and was the first Mayor of San Jose. After graduating from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Charles Belden bought his first camera to record a European tour with his school friend, Eugene Phelps.[2] The highlight of the tour was a journey through Russia in Belden's 1908 Packard, the first automobile to make such a trip in the country. After the trip, Belden went to work as a cowboy on the Phelps (Pitchfork) Ranch in Wyoming.[1] In 1912, Belden married Eugene's sister, Frances. The couple had three children, Annice, Margot, and Mary Elizabeth, who died while still a toddler. Eugene's father died in 1922, leaving Eugene and Charles to take over management of the Pitchfork Ranch. Belden's 1921\u20131940 photographs of the Pitchfork Ranch were widely published, including in The Saturday Evening Post, National Geographic, and on the cover of Life magazine.[3]\nAirplanes became a fascination for Belden. In the late 1920s, Charles became involved in raising antelope and sending them by airplane to zoos around the world, including some to Germany in the Hindenburg.[4] He helped to pioneer the process of planting fish from the air and filmed the experience for future reference. In addition, he helped the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission conduct a census of wildlife herd populations using aerial photographs.\nEstate taxes, mismanagement, and an agricultural depression that began in 1921 took their toll on the Pitchfork and the ranch fell into decline. To meet expenses, in the 1930s the family turned their home into a dude ranch, but this response did not stop the financial drain. After many years of strained relations, Charles divorced Frances in 1940 and moved to Florida with a new wife, Verna Steele Belden. Charles Belden died in 1966 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in St. Petersburg, Florida.[1]\n\nThis article about an American photographer is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",

        "paragraph": "Mark Dean Schwab (December 16, 1968 \u2013 July 1, 2008) was an American prisoner in the state of Florida, where he was executed for the April 18, 1991 rape and murder of 11-year-old Junny Rios-Martinez, Jr.[1]  Schwab was convicted of the crime in 1992 and sentenced to death. In addition, he received two life sentences.\nSchwab was released from prison on March 4, 1991, after serving three years of an eight-year sentence for the aggravated rape of a 13-year-old boy committed in 1987.  The rest of his sentence was commuted and he was placed on 15 years of probation.\nA month later, Cocoa resident Junny Rios-Martinez, Jr. went missing.  Schwab had seen Junny's picture in the March 21, 1991 edition of Florida Today.  He became friendly with the boy and his family, introducing himself as an associate of Malcom Denemark from that newspaper. After getting to know Junny, Schwab exploited his interest in surfing by saying he had left Florida Today for a job at a surfing magazine. On April 18, 1991, Junny was spotted getting into a U-Haul truck.\nOn April 20, 1991, Schwab called his aunt in Ohio, claiming a man named \"Donald\" forced him to kidnap and rape Junny, under threat of killing Junny's mother, Vicki.  The next day, police tapped a phone call with Schwab's aunt's permission, and determined Schwab's location.  Schwab was arrested, and led police to Junny's dead body, found in Canaveral Groves, a rural area of Brevard County, Florida in a footlocker that was \"nearly shut\" covered in palm fronds, debris, and wrapped in rope.[2]\nOn May 15, 1991, Schwab appeared in a state court in Brevard County, pleading not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping a child under age 13 and sexual assault of a child under age 13. Prosecutors sought the death penalty.  Schwab waived his right to a jury trial, and was convicted on May 22, 1992.  At trial, witnesses had testified that Schwab was raped at gunpoint by a friend's father as a child.[3] On July 1, 1992, he was sentenced to death for the murder, and given two life sentences for the kidnapping and sexual battery of a child under the age of 13. In addition, his probation was revoked on the previous rape conviction, and he was re-sentenced to an additional life sentence, giving him a total of three life sentences.\nThe case led to the passage of the Junny Rios-Martinez, Jr., Act of 1992, which prohibited those convicted of sexual battery from receiving early release in the state of Florida.\nSchwab's Florida Department of Corrections prisoner number was 111129.[4] After his sentence, he was housed at Florida State Prison in Starke, Florida.\nOn December 15, 2006, Governor Jeb Bush suspended all pending executions until further notice after the execution of \u00c1ngel Nieves D\u00edaz had taken much longer than usual.[5] This ban was lifted when the new Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, signed Schwab's death warrant on July 18, 2007.[6] Schwab was then transferred to Florida State Prison. He was scheduled for execution by means of lethal injection on November 15, 2007, at 6:00\u00a0p.m. EST. However, federal judge Anne C. Conway granted a stay of execution on November 14.[7] On November 15, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the execution could proceed,[8][9] but the United States Supreme Court blocked the execution later that same day pending a Kentucky case that challenged the three-drug combination used for lethal injection in both Florida and Kentucky.[10][11][12]\nThe Supreme Court upheld Kentucky's death penalty on April 16, 2008, by a vote of 7 to 2.[13] Crist signed a new death warrant for Schwab the next day, without a date for execution. On May 19, the Supreme Court specifically denied Schwab's appeal, permitting Crist to reschedule the execution.[14] Schwab's final appeal to the Florida Supreme Court was denied because similar claims had already been declined by the Supreme Court.[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "\"Change\" is a song recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera. It was written by Aguilera, Fancy Hagood and Flo Reutter, while its production was done by Flo Reutter and Martin Terefe. RCA Records premiered the song on June 16, 2016, on On Air with Ryan Seacrest. The song was dedicated to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting. The proceedings are donated to the National Compassion Fund to benefit the victims' families.[1]\nLyrically, the song talks about self-identity and acceptance.[2] Characterized as a slow ballad, received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised Aguilera's vocals and the song's empowering lyrics.\nThe song was recorded for her forthcoming record but was repurposed and mastered in light of recent events, premiered on Apple Music, is Aguilera's way of honoring the victims lost in the Orlando tragedy and promoting peace. Aguilera writes in a message posted on her website:\nThe horrific tragedy that occurred in Orlando continues to weigh heavily on my mind. I am sending so much love and so many prayers to the victims and their families. Like so many, I want to help be part of the change this world needs to make it a beautiful inclusive place where humanity can love each other freely and passionately.[3]Co-writer Who Is Fancy revealed that he started writing the song in 2015 after a police officer shot and killed 18-year-old Mansur Ball-Bey in St. Louis. \"I was just having a lot of conversation about race and minorities and how something needed to be done\". \"It just felt like so much injustice. At that time, the bill allowing gay marriage had also not passed. So the song was just a reflection on what was needed by so many \u2014 change.\"[4]\n\"Change\" is a gospel ballad.[5] The song is written in the key of G\u266d major with a tempo of 82 beats per minute.  The song alternates between 34 time and 44 time while the song follows a chord progression of G\u266d/B\u266d \u2013 C\u266d \u2013 G\u266d, and Aguilera's vocals span from E\u266d3 to D\u266d5.[6]\nIn January 2015, it was reported that \"Change\" was intended for Aguilera's then-upcoming, eight studio album, supposedly called Blonde.[7][8] It was listed among nineteen other titles from the alleged, leaked tracklist.[7][8] \"Change\" was then released in Spring 2016 and omitted from 2018's Liberation.\n\"Change\" received an average rating of 7.75/10 from music blog Idolator based on four editors' reviews. Robbie Daw wrote that the song is \"a lovely anthem about tolerance that never teeters toward the overly dramatic,\" though the reviewers did find the song somewhat \"undercooked\" compared to some of Aguilera's previous ballads such as 2002's \"Beautiful\".[9] Lucas Villa of AXS wrote, \"[The song] is a little soulful tune with a heartfelt message capable of reaching the heavens in Xtina's hands.\"[10] Spin's Brennan Carley praised the song, saying that it reminds listeners \"just how vocally walloping Aguilera can be when she sings even the simplest of notes\".[11] Fuse complimented the song's \"empowering message\",[12] and Sophie Atkinson of Bustle called it \"haunting\", as well as a \"genuinely moving and beautiful piece of music\".[13]\nElton John praised the song, calling it \"beautiful\" and \"very moving\" during his Rocket Hour radio show.[14] Samuel Granger of The Odyssey called \"Change\" one of his favorite songs of 2016,[15] Luvpop listed it as one of the year's best songs,[16] and Billboard's Muri Assun\u00e7\u00e3o believed it has an empowering value.[17] Assun\u00e7\u00e3o also considered \"Change\" a LGBTQ anthem.[17]\n",

        "paragraph": "Terry Melvin Sims (February 5, 1942 \u2013 February 23, 2000)[1] was an American convicted murderer who was executed by the state of Florida for the murder of George Pfeil, a sheriff deputy who was killed during a robbery at the Longwood Village Pharmacy in Longwood, Florida, in 1977.[2] Sims was executed in 2000 with the use of lethal injection, becoming the first inmate executed with that method in Florida, after the previous execution, which was conducted under the electric chair, had been seriously botched.[3]\nOn December 29, 1977, Sims along with three accomplices, James \"B.B.\" Halsell, Curtis Baldree, and Clarence Eugene Robinson, committed a robbery at the Longwood Village Pharmacy in Longwood, Florida.[2] Sims and Baldree entered the building, while Halsell and Robinson waited in the getaway car. Baldree went toward the back of the store to rob the pharmacist, while Sims watched the front door. They ordered the customers to enter the bathroom. \nAt the same time, 57-year-old former U.S. Marine Corps soldier and World War II veteran George Pfeil, a retired New York City officer (1946\u20131973) and the Seminole County reserve deputy sheriff (1973\u20131977), entered the store. When he saw that the place was being robbed, Pfeil and Sims began exchanging gunfire at one another.[4] Pfeil was shot twice, both wounds being fatal. Sims was shot once but managed to flee the scene. Sims fled the state of Florida not long after, taking refuge in California. There, in June 1978, he was arrested after a failed robbery.[2]\nSims was extradited to Florida to stand trial. At the trial, Halsell and Baldree testified that after Pfeil's murder, Sims bragged that he had \"killed him with one bullet\".[2] Robinson was not present at the trial as he was not caught yet. In the end, Sims was found guilty of first degree murder and was sentenced to death. Baldree and Halsell were both convicted of their roles in the robbery and were both given two-year prison terms. Baldree and Halsell were eventually released, but were shot to death by Robinson in 1981 and 1982, respectively. Robinson's whereabouts were discovered and he was arrested on June 8, 1983, when he was identified for shooting and seriously wounding two FBI agents, Thomas Sobolewski and Dennis Wicklein, five days earlier.[2]\nIn 1999, convicted killer Allen Lee Davis was executed in Florida by the routine method of the electric chair. During his execution, blood began rapidly pouring out of his nose, and witnesses reported that Davis was still alive after the electrocution stopped.[5] The execution was considered by some to have been botched, and this prompted the United States Supreme Court to challenge the use of Florida's electric chair, temporarily halting all executions in the state.[2]  By this time, other U.S. states had converted their execution method to lethal injection, and Florida soon also decided to change its method.\nSims, who had spent over 20-years on death row, was scheduled to be executed on November 2, 1999. However, a judge awarded Sims a stay of execution, rescheduling it to February 23 the next year.[6] A week before his scheduled execution, Sims challenged the use of lethal injection, but his appeals were denied. On February 23, Sims was executed with the injection method, becoming the first person to be executed with it in Florida.[3][7][8] His final words were \"I love my family. I love all my friends and my rabbi\".[7] Since his execution, all other executions in Florida have been performed by lethal injection, although inmates can still choose to be executed by the electric chair.[9]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Flat-Tire murders were a series of unsolved murders in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties, Florida, occurring between February 1975 and January 1976. The name originated from the investigators' belief that, when the offender committed two of the murders, he had deflated the tires of the victims' cars. The list of suspected victims ultimately included 12 girls and women whose bodies were discovered in or near South Florida canals.[1] Some forensic experts have questioned whether a single offender was responsible for all the murders, while others have proclaimed that the murderer might have killed more than 30 women in multiple states.[2] The murders were the subject of a 2021 book, The Flat Tire Murders: Unsolved Crimes of a South Florida Serial Killer.\nThe first murder victim of the Flat-Tire murderer was 27-year-old respiratory therapist Ronnie Sue Gorlin, who went missing on July 22, 1975 after leaving her Miami Beach apartment to visit her mother at Parkway Hospital.[3] The next day, her naked body was found in the Graham Canal, with signs that she had been sexually assaulted and then stabbed to death. Her car, a rented burgundy-white Oldsmobile Cutlass, was found in a shopping center parking lot with a slashed tire.[4] Eight days later, 21-year-old Elyse Rapp, originally from New York City, left her apartment to go shopping, and was last seen at a Hollywood mall in the evening before vanishing. Her car, a rented yellow Chevrolet Vega, was found in the mall's parking lot, also with a deflated tire. The day after, Rapp's body was found in the same canal where Gorlin's body was found earlier.[3] Both women shared the characteristics of being found naked, except for a necklace with the Hebrew inscription for \"life\" around Rapp's neck and a single sandal on one of Gorlin's feet.[5] Following a forensic autopsy, it was determined that Rapp's cause of death was drowning, but she had been sexually assaulted prior to her death. In both of these cases, the killer had chosen young women who traveled in cars by themselves. In their absence, he had deflated their vehicles' tires, after which he waited for them to return and then offered to fix their tires, presenting himself as a good samaritan.[5]\nAfter the discovery of Gorlin and Rapp's bodies, the police first suggested that there was a serial killer active in two counties. According to them, a total of 12 young women killed in South Florida might've been victims of the same offender. The first of them was 20-year-old Judith Ann Oesterling, from Indiana, who went missing on February 1, 1975 from Miami-Dade County after returning home from her job at a massage parlor. Two days later, her body was found in the canal bordering Broward and Miami-Dade. A few days after that, not far from where Oesterling was found, the body of 17-year-old divorcee Arietta Tinker was found in the canal.[6]\nBarbara Davis Stephens, 23, the daughter of the president of Anchor Electric Co., went missing on the evening of February 12th, after she said she would travel to Coral Gables to visit a friend. Her car, a cream-olive-silver 1973 Chevrolet Camaro was later found in a parking lot near the center of Miami,[7] with her body later found on February 20th in a wooded lot.[4]\nFrom May 1975 onwards, four other young women were found in the canals of Broward County: 19-year-old Nancy Fox from West Palm Beach, gone missing after going to a laundry in late May and was later found in Fort Lauderdale, apparently beaten to death with a blunt object;[6] Barbara Susan Schreiber and Belinda Darlene Zetterower, both 14 and from Hollywood, were last seen going out on June 18th, and their bodies were found two days later on the bank of the canal shot to death, but with no signs of rape.[6][8] The final victim, 14-year-old Robin Leslie Losch, was found dead on July 11th, in a canal about half a mile from where Schreiber and Zetterower's bodies were found. Unlike the other victims, she was fully clothed.[6]\nThe suspected perpetrator was described as a white male, aged 20\u201325, well-dressed, physically athletic and attractive, possibly married, likely very intelligent with an above-average IQ and a sexual sadist. Using his charm, he won the trust of potential victims which he would lure to his car. A reward of $1,000 was announced for any information that would lead to his capture.[1]\nAccording to Sgt. Edwin Carlstedt of Sonoma County, California, the Flat-Tire murderer was possibly responsible for upwards of thirty murders across several states since the early 1970s, starting in California. After these killings abruptly ceased in December 1973, nine similar murders were recorded in Washington the following year, but stopped in September.[2] And after that, another spate of killings, in which the perpetrator demonstrated a similar modus operandi to the killer in California and Washington, occurred in Idaho, Utah and Colorado. In most cases, the victims, who physically resembled each other, were beaten and raped before death, with the killer stripping the bodies and throwing them in canals, streams or leaving them near embankments. A total of 35 such murders were recorded, which, according to this theory, were committed by the same man, but this has not been definitely proven.[2]\nSubsequently, the list of possible victims included 15-year-old Mary Coppolla and 27-year-old Marlene Annabelli, who had arrived in Fort Lauderdale from Pennsylvania on October 17, 1975, renting a room for a one-week stay at the Lauderdale Beach Club. Her body, strangled with a rope, was found by a motorcyclist nine days later in a dump outside the city.[9] The 12th and final supposed victim was 17-year-old Michelle Winters, whose body was found floating in the Snapper Creek in Pembroke Pines on January 11, 1976. She was last seen in early January in Fort Lauderdale, with friends of the deceased claiming that she had been depressed and planned to enlist in the Navy. Winters' mother told police that her daughter had likely voluntarily entered her killer's car, as she often preferred to hitchhike.[10]\nIt has been suggested that notorious serial killer Ted Bundy could have been the culprit, but so far, no evidence has been recorded of him being present in Florida during this period. To this day, all the murders remain unsolved.\n",

One comic is about a superhero, Rainbow Boy, who uses his powers to fight \"Doc Drumpf\" and his armies of \"Spider Haters\".[15]\nLove is Love won the 2017 Eisner Award for Best Anthology.

The family traveled extensively when she was growing up.[2] She received her A. B. degree from Randolph-Macon College and, after a brief marriage in 1934, went on to earn her master's degree in librarianship at the University of Kentucky in 1951.[3] She worked as a librarian at Sarasota, Florida, and while there, wrote The First Sex.[3]\nDavis had originally intended  The First Sex to be \"a short essay on wrongs towards women\" inspired by the death of her sister in 1968.[4] As she researched, she learned more about historical periods when women were in charge, and about subsequent anti-women prejudices.[4] She argued that congenital killers and criminals have two Y chromosomes, that men say they don't mind women being successful but require femininity when feminine qualities work against success, and that a matriarchy should replace the existing patriarchy.[5] Prof. Ginette Castro criticized Davis' position as grounded \"in the purest female chauvinism.\"[6]\nDavis committed suicide on July 30, 1974, by shooting herself. According to feminist author Andrea Dworkin, Davis' suicide was largely impacted by the rape she underwent a few years prior in 1971, as well as the cancer she suffered from.[7] Her papers are held by the Charles E.

        "paragraph": "\nJoshua Earl Patrick Phillips (born March 17, 1984) is an American who was convicted of murder as a child. In November 1998, when he was 14 years old, Phillips killed Maddie Clifton, his 8-year-old friend and neighbor. The following year, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Phillips stated that he killed Clifton to stop her from crying after she was accidentally struck with a baseball while they were playing, and that he feared punishment from his abusive father. Although elements of Phillips's story are disputed, officials who were involved in his prosecution have subsequently expressed contrition over the severity of his sentence. Phillips is eligible for re-sentencing in 2023.\nPhillips was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on March 17, 1984, to Steve and Melissa Phillips. Steve, a drug addict and alcoholic, was violent towards Phillips and Melissa, who both reported living in fear of him. Steve imposed strict rules on his son,[1] got angry if he had other children in the house when he was not present, and particularly disliked young girls; Melissa said she never understood why her husband disliked girls.[2] Eventually, Steve decided to relocate the family from Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania to Florida, separating Josh from his half-brothers Daniel and Benjie.[3]\nIn November 1998, Phillips was 14 years old and living with his family in Jacksonville, Florida. Neighbors described Phillips as \"quiet and friendly\". According to Maddie Clifton's mother, Phillips and her daughter were friends and she never had any reason to be afraid of him. Phillips had no arrests or history of violence prior to the murder.[2][4] His school teacher said he was a popular student who did not stand out, describing him as fun and silly.[5]\nAccording to Phillips, on November 3, 1998, he was home alone when Maddie Clifton, who lived across the road from the Phillips, came to his house asking him to come outside and play baseball. Phillips agreed, even though he was not allowed to have friends over while his parents were not home. As the two were playing baseball, Phillips accidentally hit the ball into Clifton's eye, causing her to bleed, cry, and scream. Phillips panicked, knowing his father Steve would be home soon and fearing his reaction. Phillips dragged Clifton into his house, saying that the clothing came off Clifton's lower body as he did so. He hit her with the baseball bat to stop her from screaming before putting her under the base of his bed. When Steve returned home, Phillips interacted with him for a period of time before returning to his room. When Phillips discovered that Clifton was still alive and moaning under his bed, he removed the mattress, cut her throat, and stabbed her in the chest seven times with the knife from a Leatherman tool, killing her.[2]\nClifton's disappearance was reported around 5:00\u00a0pm that day. Police and volunteers searched for Clifton for six days; Phillips participated in the search.[2] He later stated he spent the following week living in denial, saying, \"I was putting myself in a fantasy world that nothing had happened. That was my defense mechanism for everything when I was a kid. I never made the decision\u00a0... to ignore it. I just did.\"[4]\nOn November 10, Melissa Phillips went into her son's room and noticed a wet spot on the floor. She searched the room and found Clifton's body, immediately leaving the house to report the incident to the police. Phillips was arrested later that day at his school, and confessed to the murder within hours.[2]\nProsecutors disputed some parts of Phillips's story. State Attorney Harry Shorstein suggested the murder may have been sexually motivated, saying that Phillips had talked about sexual matters with both Maddie Clifton and her older sister.[6] The autopsy found no evidence of sexual assault, though prosecutors argued the lack of dirt and sand on Clifton's body did not support Phillips's assertion that her clothes came off as he dragged her into his room.[2] Prosecutors also noted that no blood was found in the backyard, or on the baseball that Phillips said had struck Clifton, and argued that this did not support his version of events.[6]\nPhillips was tried as an adult. The trial was moved from Duval County, Florida, to Polk County over concerns about the publicity in Jacksonville. Phillips's lawyer, Richard D. Nichols, did not call a single witness for the defense, a move the prosecutors later said was a surprising and risky strategy. Nichols intended to base much of the defense on a closing argument to the jury, where he stated Clifton's death was \"an act that began as an accident and deteriorated through panic that bordered on madness\".[2] According to Phillips, Nichols never attempted to question him over the events of the murder, and only played chess with him when visiting him in prison prior to the trial. Melissa Phillips disagreed with Nichols's strategy, though Steve insisted on letting the lawyer do as he pleased. Nichols discouraged Phillips's parents from allowing him to testify. Accordingly, Phillips never spoke during his trial.[2][4] The trial started on July 6, 1999, and lasted only two days, an unusually short time due to the defense calling no witnesses. Jurors took just over two hours to convict Phillips of first-degree murder.[6] He was later sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole;[2] he was not eligible for the death penalty as he was under 16.[6]\n",

The concert was a Memorial Day weekend album release party that began on May 29 and featured live performances by local hip hop artists.[7] The shooting took place around 12:30 am[8] when two vehicles pulled up and the occupants began to open fire into the crowd.[9][10]\nOne of the injured called his parents, who told reporters their son said the shooters wore ski masks and hoodies, and opened fire with no warning.[11] Police say the shooting was targeted.[9] Another wounded victim died in the hospital four days later.[12]\nThe Miami-Dade Police Director said that the shooting was a \"targeted and cowardly act of gun violence\". The Chief of the Miami Police Department, discussed the shooting with the media in connection to another shooting earlier in the week and claimed the two shootings were \"an indication of the problem we have with the scourge of gun violence in this country that we need to do much more at a federal level to stop.\"[11]\nGovernor Ron DeSantis also issued a statement which offered condolences to those killed and injured, and that the perpetrators would be brought to swift justice.[8] In response to DeSantis's condolences, state Senator Shevrin Jones urged DeSantis to sit down with state Democrats and discuss ways of addressing gun violence, saying, \"Thoughts and prayers have been going on for years and thoughts and prayers haven't done a damn thing inside the Black community - or any community when it comes to gun violence.\"[13]\nLocal businessman and television personality Marcus Lemonis offered a $100,000 reward to help authorities arrest and convict the suspects in the case.[14] The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives later added $25,000 to the reward, for a total of $125,000.[15]\nOn September 24, 2021, police arrested 22-year-old Miami Gardens resident Davonte Barnes (born June 7, 1999) in connection to being the gunmen's lookout.[16] A couple of weeks later on October 7, a 20-year-old Miami Gardens resident was arrested and confessed to being one of the gunmen.[17] On December 15, 2021, all charges against him were dropped, because police continued to question him after he had requested an attorney, and he had given an incriminating statement before his attorney had arrived, in violation of his Miranda rights.[18][19][20]\n",

His deformity was the genetic condition ectrodactyly, in which the fingers and toes are fused together to form claw-like extremities. Because of this, Stiles performed under the stage name \"Lobster Boy\".\nAccording to Grady's father, the Stiles family had a long history of ectrodactyly, dating back to 1840. Grady Stiles Jr. was the fourth child of Grady F. Stiles Sr. and his wife Edna. Capitalizing on his deformity, Grady Stiles Sr. was a sideshow attraction in a traveling carnival. After Grady Jr. was born he was folded into his father's sideshow act at the age of seven.[1] Stiles married twice and had four children, two of whom also had ectrodactyly. Stiles and his two children toured together as The Lobster Family. When not traveling with the carnival, the Stiles family lived in Gibsonton, Florida, where many other carnival performers lived during the winter season.\nStiles was an alcoholic and was abusive to his family.[1] Due to his ectrodactyly, he was unable to walk. While he sometimes used a wheelchair, he most commonly used his hands and arms for locomotion. He developed substantial upper body strength that, when combined with his bad temper and alcoholism, made him dangerous to others.\nIn 1978 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Stiles shot and killed his oldest daughter's fianc\u00e9 on the eve of their wedding. He was brought to trial, where he openly confessed to killing the man and was convicted of third-degree murder.[2][3] He was not sent to prison as no state institution was equipped to care for an inmate with ectrodactyly. Stiles was instead sentenced to house arrest and fifteen years probation.\nStiles stopped drinking thereafter, and during this period remarried his first wife, Mary Teresa. However, he soon began drinking again and his family claimed that he became even more abusive. In 1992, Teresa, together with her son from a previous marriage, Harry Glenn Newman Jr., hired a seventeen-year-old sideshow performer named Chris Wyant to kill Stiles for $1500 dollars .[4]\nWyant was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to 27 years in prison. Harry Newman was given life in prison for his role as the mastermind and Teresa was given 43 years in prison for conspiracy to commit murder.\nStiles' son, Grady Stiles III, disputes the claim that Teresa had him murdered. According to him, his mother, Teresa, and father were arguing. Teresa had said 'Something needs to be done.' Teresa's son overheard this, and went to a neighbor and repeated those words. Shortly after this happened, as Stiles smoked a cigarette while watching television on the sofa, the neighbor entered his home with a semi-automatic pistol and shot him in the head twice, killing him. Stiles was reportedly widely disliked in his community, so much so that only 10 people came to his funeral, and nobody volunteered as a pallbearer to carry his coffin.[5]\nFred Rosen wrote a book on the case called Lobster Boy: The Bizarre Life and Brutal Death of Grady Stiles Jr., and E! made a True Hollywood Story episode based on the case titled \"The Murder of Lobster Boy\". A&E Network also made a City Confidential episode based on the case called \"Gibsonton: The Last Side Show\".\nStiles' likeness appears on the album cover for Silverchair's Freak Show.\nA person like Grady, going by the name of \"Lobster Boy\", appears in a Deadpool comic. Deadpool was hired to assassinate him, but fails when he figures out he is possessed by Xaphan, a fallen angel, and starts possessing the souls. He was later saved by the two Ghost Riders, but at the end is shot again in the head by Deadpool for being cruel to other freaks.[6]\n",

Like his companion Henry Lee Lucas, Toole made confessions which he later recanted, which resulted in murder convictions. The discrediting of the case against Lucas for crimes for which Toole had offered corroborating statements created doubts as to whether either was a genuine serial killer or, as Hugh Aynesworth suggested, both were merely compliant interviewees who police used to clear unsolved murders from the books.\nToole received two death sentences, but on appeal, they were commuted to life imprisonment. He died in his cell from cirrhosis, at age 49. Police attributed the 1981 murder of Adam Walsh to Toole on the basis of recanted statements. Lucas had backed Toole's confession to the Walsh murder, claiming that he had been in possession of the victim's severed head, though Lucas had a reputation for false confessions.\nOttis Toole was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida. Toole's father was an alcoholic who abandoned him, while his abusive mother would dress him in girls' clothing and call him Susan.[1] As a young child he was a victim of sexual abuse and forced incest at the hands of many close relatives and acquaintances, including his older sister and a next-door neighbor. He stated that his maternal grandmother was a Satanist who exposed him to various Satanic practices and rituals in his youth, including graverobbing.[2] Toole claimed this abuse began when he revealed his homosexuality to his family.[1]\nToole was often classified as having a mild intellectual disability, with an intelligence quotient (IQ) of 75.[1] He also had epilepsy, which resulted in frequent grand mal seizures. Throughout Toole's childhood, he frequently ran away from home and often slept in abandoned houses. He was a serial arsonist from a young age and was sexually aroused by fire.[3]\nIn the documentary Death Diploma, Toole stated that he was forced to have sex with a friend of his father's when he was five years old. He felt he knew that he was gay when he was 10 years old and that he had a sexual relationship with a neighborhood boy when he was 12. Toole dropped out of school in the ninth grade and began visiting gay bars. He also stated he had been a male prostitute as a teenager and that he became obsessed with gay pornography at some point.[1]\nToole stated that he committed his first murder at the age of 14; after being propositioned for sex by a traveling salesman, Toole ran over the salesman with his own car.[1] Toole was first arrested at the age of 17 in August 1965 for loitering.\nMuch information on Toole between 1966 and 1973 is unclear, but authorities believe that he began drifting around the Southwestern United States and that he supported himself by prostitution and panhandling. While living in Nebraska, Toole was one of the prime suspects in the 1974 murder of 24-year-old Patricia Webb. Shortly after, he left Nebraska and briefly settled in Boulder, Colorado. One month later, he became a prime suspect in the homicide of 31-year-old Ellen Holman, who was murdered on October 14, 1974. With many accusations against him, Toole left Boulder and headed back to Jacksonville.\nIn early 1975, Toole returned to Jacksonville after drifting and hitch-hiking through the American South. On January 14, 1976, he married a woman 25 years his senior. She left him three days later, after discovering his homosexuality. Toole later said during an interview that his marriage was a tactic meant to conceal his true sexuality.[1]\n",

Funchess was convicted of and sentenced to death for the 1974 murders of 52-year-old Anna Waldrop and 56-year-old Clayton Keaton Ragan during a robbery of his former workplace. Funchess also severely injured 62-year-old Bertha McLeod, who died of her injuries in 1977; however, Funchess was never convicted of McLeod's murder. He was sentenced to death in 1975 \u2013 and resentenced to death in 1979 \u2013 for Waldrop and Ragan's murders.\nFunchess's case gained significant press coverage and controversy due to the fact that he was a Vietnam War veteran who was diagnosed with an extreme case of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of his service. At the time of the murders, the disorder was not fully recognized; the American Psychiatric Association added PTSD to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III) in 1980, several years after Funchess was sentenced to death. Funchess was diagnosed with the disorder in 1982. Courts and Florida Governor Bob Graham repeatedly denied Funchess's clemency requests due to him not having brought up PTSD as a mitigating factor at the time of his 1975 trial, decisions that prompted criticism from Funchess's defense attorneys, war veterans, and anti-death penalty activists, who argued that his PTSD diminished his culpability in the murders and that his sacrifice on behalf of the country's military should have earned him clemency.[3][4] Funchess's execution made him the first Vietnam War veteran diagnosed with PTSD to be executed by a U.S. state.[5]\nFunchess was born on March 16, 1947, in Jacksonville, Florida, to Alice and Venis (or Wenis) Funchess, the latter of whom operated tractors for a fertilizer plant.[2][6] David Funchess had at least two older siblings, Mary and Willie J. Funchess; Willie was 2 years old at the time of David Funchess's birth.[6]\nFunchess's appellate team, consisting of attorneys including Mark Olive, Scharlette Holdman, and Michael Mello, gathered statements from people who knew Funchess before he served in the Vietnam War, including multiple close childhood friends, a Baptist minister who had attended middle school with Funchess, and a high school biology teacher, all of whom described Funchess as \"a quiet, intelligent, and caring person who was in no way headed toward a life of crime,\" who had never used illicit drugs prior to his service.[7] The appellate team also revealed that Funchess was a victim of child abuse who grew up in poverty; his sister Mary told his appellate team, \"When most children got spankings when they misbehaved, we got \"killings.\" We would have been glad to have been hit with just a hand or a belt, but it was usually with fists, sticks, extension cords or a piece of water hose. Often we didn't even know why we were being hit.\"[7]\nIn 1965, Funchess graduated near the top of his class in high school. In 1967, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps; that summer, he and his unit, the 3rd Marine Division, were sent to serve in the Vietnam War, near the Laotian border, during one of the war's most intense periods of combat.[3] At the time of his drafting, Funchess had no criminal record.[2][8]\nDuring Funchess's time in Vietnam, he was exposed to Agent Orange, a toxic herbicide, defoliant, and chemical agent linked to physical and neurological problems in veterans and their offspring.[4][9] While on death row, Funchess told his sister that he had very few memories of his time in Vietnam but could remember being ordered to shoot a pajama-clad elderly man who was too physically handicapped to escape, watching a fellow Marine being decapitated by a missile, and having his own body blown into the air by the force of a mortar explosion.[7][4]\nTwo and a half months into his service, Funchess received severe injuries to his ankle and leg from stepping on a land mine. A medical report described that he was medically evacuated to a naval hospital in Japan for three months and subsequently sent to a naval hospital in Virginia, where he was housed in a psychiatric ward with a diagnosis of \"Psychoneurotic Depressive Reaction,\" a precursor to post-traumatic stress disorder.[7][4]\nSometime during Funchess's service, one of his brothers was murdered. He was given leave to attend his brother's funeral, but he did not return to duty at the scheduled time, causing him to be briefly listed as absent without leave (AWOL). This designation was lifted after he returned to combat. Following his hospital stay in Virginia, Funchess was again required to report back to active duty in January 1968, but he did not, leading to him again being listed as AWOL. His second designation as AWOL led to his dishonorable discharge, precluding him from receiving benefits from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.[10] However, he received a Purple Heart due to his wounds. He also received the Vietnam Service Medal and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.[7][3][4]\nAfter returning from the war, Funchess was put on pain medicine to cope with his injuries, which led to him developing a heroin addiction. Funchess's family members said that he underwent \"strange\" behavioral changes and that he would dig foxholes under his mother's house and sleep in them at night; he also began locking himself in his bedroom for multiple days at a time.[4] Two of his sisters described his post-Vietnam temperament as \"shellshocked.\"[11] One sister, Queenie, described incidents wherein Funchess would \"go blank\" and become unresponsive for several minutes at a time in the middle of conversations, and that she would hear him crying in his room at night. He also disclosed to her that he had recurring nightmares involving the unarmed Vietnamese civilians he had been ordered to kill.[7] At a press conference protesting Funchess's upcoming execution, Jeff Thompson, a Vietnam War veteran and lawyer who represented Funchess prior to his execution, said Funchess's behavior demonstrated that he, like many war veterans, could not readjust to civilian life. He also described Funchess's case of PTSD as \"extreme.\"[2][5]\n",

The riots began on the night of June 11 and ended on June 15, in the neighborhood that was then known as Central Park.\nA hydroplane race took place on the day of June 11, where the Tampa Police Department's anti-riot unit, the Selective Enforcement Unit, was covering the event during the afternoon.[2] TPD Chief James P. Mullins would be absent that day.[3][2]\nCentral Park, previously known as \"The Scrub\", was Tampa's first African-American neighborhood[4] located between downtown Tampa and Ybor City.[5] The neighborhood would grow with the arrival of Henry Plant's railroad in 1883 and the cigar industry two years later. Starting in the 1890s and lasting until the 1950s, it would be the most significant black neighborhood in the city, with Central Avenue being called the \"Harlem of the South\".\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Tampa underwent significant urban development.\nThe federal Housing Act of 1949 and subsequent amendments allowed cities to pursue urban renewal projects. However, a 1952 Florida Supreme Court case ruled that cities could not use eminent domain to sell the land to private companies to redevelop. Though, with this case, cities in Florida could not participate in the Act, the legislature passed laws allowing Tampa and Tallahassee to undertake urban renewal projects. Urban renewal in the Central Avenue neighborhood was seen as a way to increase tax revenue.\n",

Critics and fans often credit him for his musical versatility, with his music exploring emo, trap, trap metal, nu metal, indie rock, lo-fi, hip hop, R&B, and punk rock. He is considered to be a leading figure in the emo rap and SoundCloud rap genres, which garnered mainstream attention during the mid-to-late 2010s.[17]\nBorn in Plantation, Florida, XXXTentacion spent most of his childhood in Lauderhill. He began writing music after being released from a juvenile detention center and soon started his music career on SoundCloud in 2013, employing styles and techniques that were unconventional in rap music such as distortion and heavy guitar-backed instrumentals, drawing inspiration from third-wave emo and grunge. In 2014, he formed the underground collective Members Only and alongside other members of the collective soon became a popular figure in SoundCloud rap, a trap music scene that takes elements of lo-fi music and harsh 808s.[18] XXXTentacion gained mainstream attention with the single \"Look at Me\". His debut album 17 (2017) is certified double-platinum in the US and reached number two on the Billboard 200. His second album ? (2018) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and is certified quadruple-platinum in the US. Its lead single, \"Sad!\", posthumously reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[19] and had amassed more than 1.3\u00a0billion views on YouTube and 1.7\u00a0billion streams on Spotify by November 2021, as well as being certified Diamond by the RIAA in August 2021.[20][21][22][23]\nXXXTentacion had faced a variety of legal issues throughout his lifetime, most notably the controversy that arose from the battery charges that were levied against him in 2016.[24][25] XXXTentacion's history of legal issues and alleged violence has been described by some as defining his legacy, while others have criticized the media's portrayal of him, arguing that his perceived improvements in character later in life have made his legacy into a tale of the power of second chances and redemption.[26][27][28][29]\nOn June 18, 2018, XXXTentacion, age 20, was murdered when he was shot near a motorcycle dealership in Deerfield Beach, Florida. The attackers fled the scene in an SUV after stealing his Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000 in cash. Four suspects were arrested and charged with first-degree murder among other charges, and the motive for the killing remains under investigation.[30] In August 2022, one of the four men pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against the other three defendants in their upcoming trial.[31] The trial for the remaining three suspects is currently scheduled for 2023.[32][33]\nXXXTentacion has RIAA-certified sales of 61 million units in the US and BPI-certified sales of over 7 million units in the UK, bringing his total to 68\u00a0million certified records sold in the two countries. Since his death, he has won an American Music Award and a BET Hip Hop Award and received 11 Billboard Music Award nominations.[34] Two posthumous albums were released, Skins (2018) and Bad Vibes Forever (2019); the former became his second number-one album on the Billboard 200, while the latter entered the top 5.\nJahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy was born on January 23, 1998, in Plantation, Florida, to Jamaican parents, Dwayne Ricardo Onfroy and Cleopatra Eretha Dreena Bernard.[35][36] His father named him for the Bob Marley song \"So Jah Seh\", which interpolates Ezekiel 34. Both Onfroy's father and grandfather were Rastafarians.[37] Onfroy was born with a ventricular septal defect, commonly known as a \"hole in the heart\". Due to his condition, he never grew taller than 5 feet 6 inches.[38] Onfroy stated he also had Egyptian or Syrian, Indian, and possibly Italian ancestry in an interview on The Beat in 2017.[39]\nOnfroy was mainly raised by his grandmother Collette Jones[40]\u2014due to his mother's personal problems[41]\u2014in Pompano Beach, Florida, and Lauderhill, Florida. When Onfroy was six years old, he allegedly tried to stab a man attempting to attack his mother[41] and was eventually put into a youth program before living with his grandmother.[36] A source close to the Onfroy family denied that the alleged stabbing incident occurred, and it could not be corroborated by police reports, since Onfroy was a minor.[42] When Onfroy was a child, he discovered his uncle's deceased body after the man committed suicide by hanging.[43] Onfroy referenced his trauma from the incident in multiple songs. In 2017, Onfroy alluded that he had been sexually abused by an unnamed adult when he was a child.[43] Other traumatic events that Onfroy witnessed as a child included someone being physically tortured and someone being raped.[44] According to Onfroy's mother, he was routinely beaten by his father as a child; she claimed that Onfroy's father tried to hit her in front of Onfroy on several occasions. In early 2008, when Onfroy was ten, his father was jailed for nine years in Arizona on RICO charges after the Drug Enforcement Administration organized a sting operation.[45] Onfroy's father was released from BOP custody on October 30, 2015,[46] and deported to Jamaica in late 2016.[47] In a 2017 interview, when asked about his relationship with his father, Onfroy sarcastically asked, \"What's a father?\"[48][49][50]\nOnfroy's interest in music initially started after his aunt persuaded him to begin attending school choir and later church choir. He was soon kicked out of the school choir after attacking another student.[51] Onfroy attended Margate Middle School,[40] from which he was later expelled after a series of physical altercations. He was subsequently enrolled into Sheridan House Family Ministries by his mother for over six months.[51] Onfroy began to listen to rap, nu metal, and hard rock during his time at Sheridan House Family Ministries, which led to him learning how to play the piano and guitar.[41]\n",

He performed at many famous venues including Carnegie Hall (NYC); Royal Albert Hall (London); Odeon of Herodes Atticus (Athens), Tchaikovsky Concert Hall (Moscow), as well as the Newport, Monterey, and Montreux jazz festivals.\nHe performed, toured, and recorded with Roberta Flack from 1969 to 1974, playing electric and acoustic bass.  He appears on the albums Chapter Two, Killing Me Softly and Quiet Fire. In addition, he wrote the song \"Conversation Love\" on the album Killing Me Softly.\nLater, he moved to Los Angeles to work in the film industry. He wrote the music for over 50 feature films, including the western Nate and the Colonel, Stephen King's Sometimes They Come Back, the family film Mr. Atlas, and the crime drama One False Move. His score for One False Move was nominated for \"Best Score\" by the IFC Independent Spirit Awards.\nIn later years, he was guest conductor for the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra and was a frequent guest lecturer, teacher, music producer, and photographer.\nOn the early morning of April 1, 2016, police responded to a well-being check at Plumeri's home in Dunnellon, Florida. Officers found him dead, with signs of extensive upper body trauma. Early speculation was that his death was a result of a home invasion, possibly linked to a series of such crimes in Citrus County.[3] It was subsequently discovered that he was murdered by burglars (now in custody)[4]\n",

He was selected fifth overall in the 2004 NFL Draft by the Redskins,[3] where he played four seasons until his murder in 2007.\nAs a high school player, Taylor led Gulliver Prep to a Florida state championship and set the state record for single-season touchdowns. Taylor played college football at Miami, where he was a member of the 2001 BCS National Championship team and won the Jack Tatum Trophy. With the Redskins, he gained a reputation as a hard-hitting player and was nicknamed \"Meast\" from the expression \"half man, half beast.\"[4][5] He made one Pro Bowl appearance in 2006.\nDuring the 2007 season, Taylor was shot by intruders at his Miami area home and died the next day on November 27.[6] His death led to an outpouring of national support and sympathy, especially in the Washington, D.C. and Miami areas.[7] Posthumously, he earned a second Pro Bowl selection and second-team All-Pro honors. Taylor was inducted to Washington's Ring of Fame in 2008.\nSean Taylor was born in Florida on April 1, 1983[8] to Pedro Taylor, a policeman, and Donna Junor. He spent his early years growing up with his great-grandmother Aulga Clarke in Homestead, Florida and later moved to his father's home at the age of 11. Taylor was baptized at the Bethel Seventh-day Adventist Church in Florida City by Pastor David Peay. He grew up in a low-income neighborhood in Miami, on a street lined with candy-colored houses.[9][10]\nTaylor played high school football in Pinecrest, a suburb of Miami. He originally began his high school football career at Miami Killian High School, a Class 2A public school, but transferred to Gulliver Preparatory School, a Class prep school, where he was a three-sport star in football, track and basketball. He played both offense and defense. Despite missing the first game of the season (the team's only loss), he helped Gulliver win the Florida Class 2A State Championship in 2000 with a 14\u20131 record. Taylor was a star on both sides of the ball during that season, playing running back, defensive back and linebacker.[11] He rushed for 1,400 yards and a state-record 44 touchdowns and on two occasions, rushed for more than 200 yards during Gulliver's state playoff run. He also compiled more than 100 tackles during the season and scored three touchdowns (two receiving, one rushing) in the state title game victory over Marianna High School. In track & field, Taylor won the state 2A 100-meter dash in 2000 and was also one of the state's top 400-meter dash sprinters.\nTaylor was considered the No. 1 prospect in Miami-Dade County by the Miami Herald. He was also rated the nation's No. 1 skill athlete and an All-American by Super Prep. Taylor was also an Orlando Sentinel Super Southern Team selection, the No. 1 athlete on the Florida Times-Union Super 75 list and rated the No. 1 player in Florida by The Gainesville Sun.\nIn 2007, he was also named to the Florida High School Association All-Century Team, which selected the Top 33 players in the 100-year history of high school football in the state. After his death, Taylor was honored at Gulliver by a plaque that was placed in the school's cafeteria.[12] The football field at Gulliver Prep was renamed Sean Taylor Memorial Field on September 5, 2009.\nTaylor was recruited to play for coach Larry Coker's Miami Hurricanes football team at the University of Miami. He was also a member of the Hurricanes track & field team, competing in events such as the 100-meter and 200-meters.\n",

While convicted and sentenced to death for the 1998 murder of 21-year-old Dawnia Dacosta, he is a suspect in at least ten other homicides or disappearances. He was acquitted for the 1993 murder of a man whom he claimed he stabbed in self-defense. He was profiled on Forensic Files.[2][3]\nHe is currently incarcerated in Union Correctional Institution.[1]\nBoyd was born on March 22, 1959, in Broward County, Florida. His family owns a funeral home in Fort Lauderdale. Prior to 1998, Boyd had been married twice and was the father of at least eight children. He had been sued by four separate women for failing to pay child support.\nPrior to 1998, Boyd was struggling financially and had to stay at his family's home in Plantation for periods of time. In 1996, his father, James C. Boyd, who was the owner of the family funeral home, died. In 1998, Boyd worked as a handyman for Hope Outreach Ministries. According to Boyd's family he had an ongoing cocaine problem.[4]\nIn 1990, Boyd choked his second wife, Julie McCormick, to the point of unconsciousness. McCormick had threatened to leave him for cheating on her. A felony charge of aggravated battery was brought against Boyd but was later reduced to a misdemeanor charge meaning Boyd was only given probation. In 1992, Boyd was accused of raping a girl during a date on her 18th birthday. No charges were filed however because the victim declined to prosecute.[4]\nOn October 18, 1993, Boyd stabbed Roderick Bullard to death on a Fort Lauderdale street with a kitchen knife during an argument over an automobile. Bullard was the brother of one of Boyd's girlfriends. Boyd told police that Bullard had hit him and that he \"just lost it.\" He admitted that Bullard had no weapon and never threatened him. During the trial Boyd's defense attorneys turned the tables on Bullard, playing up the fact that he had cocaine in his bloodstream. The jury called Boyd's action self-defense and acquitted him of the killing.[3]\nPolice believe Boyd is responsible for a number of unsolved murders, the sexual assaults of several women, and the disappearance of 25 year old Danielle Zacot from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1999. \nOn August 13, 1997, the naked body of 24-year-old Melissa Floyd was found in some high grass near a guardrail on I95 in Palm Beach County. She had been stabbed multiple times and was not positively identified until four months later. Floyd was known to use drugs near the Boyd family funeral home and her ID card was discovered by Boyd's family members on the funeral home grounds a few weeks after Floyd's body was found. However, there was no physical evidence linking Boyd to the crime.\nOn June 28, 1998, 19-year-old Patrece Alston was seen getting into a green Mazda with Boyd. The two were supposedly going on a trip to Winter Haven nearly 200 miles away. Boyd returned the next day without Alston, who has not been seen since. Boyd told the cops that witnesses could verify that Alston had also returned from the trip, but those witnesses later denied having seen her. Investigators are convinced that Boyd knows where Alston's body is located.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nClaude Neal (b. 1911[1] \u2013 d. October 26, 1934) was a 23-year-old African-American farmhand who was arrested in Jackson County, Florida, on October 19, 1934, for allegedly raping and killing Lola Cannady, a 19-year-old white woman missing since the preceding night. Circumstantial evidence was collected against him, but nothing directly linked him to the crime. When the news got out about his arrest, white lynch mobs began to form.[2] In order to keep Neal safe, County Sheriff Flake Chambliss moved him between multiple jails, including the county jail at Brewton, Alabama, 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away. But a lynch mob of about 100 white men from Jackson County heard where he was, and brought him back to Jackson County.[3]\nThe time and place of the lynching were provided to the news media in advance and reported on nationwide, attracting a huge crowd.[4]:\u200a126\u200a The spectacle lynching had been announced to take place at the Cannady farm, but the crowd had grown unruly, and a smaller group murdered Neal in secret. He was tortured and mutilated before being hanged by the instigators at a site along the Chattahoochee River, near Greenwood, Florida. They tied his body to the back of their truck and dragged his corpse to the Cannady farm, where a white crowd estimated at 2,000 attacked the corpse by stabbing it with sticks and knives.[2] Later that night Neal's body was hanged from a tree in the courthouse square. When the sheriff discovered it in the morning, he cut it down.[3][5]\nA large group of white people went to the courthouse in Marianna, demanding that the body be hanged again so they could see it. When the sheriff refused, they began rioting, assaulting the courthouse, attacking black people in the area, injuring 200, and looting and burning houses. The body was displayed on the courthouse steps so that anyone interested could see it.[4]\nIn the next few days, white people rioted in an attempt to drive black people from the county, injuring an estimated 200 persons, including two police, and destroying black-owned property. Eventually, Governor David Sholtz called in more than 100 troops of the National Guard to suppress the white rioting.[3]\nLola Cannady (also spelled Cannidy), a 19-year-old white woman from a farming family, was missing on the evening of Thursday, October 18, 1934, after going to a water pump to water the family's hogs.[2] Friends and neighbors helped the Cannady family in their search for Lola in the fields behind the family's land. At 6:30 A.M. the next day, they found her body poorly hidden in the woods, under the cover of two logs and a pine tree branch.[2] Cannady had been bludgeoned to death with a hammer that had been taken from the Cannady field.[2] She may have been raped.[2]\nCounty Sheriff Flake Chambliss became focused on two suspects: Claude Neal, a 23-year-old black farmworker who lived about a quarter mile away, and Calvin Cross, who was white.[2] Sheriff Chambliss had received reports that Neal had been in the field near the same water pump that Lola had gone to and that he was gone for about two hours before going home.[2] Neal and Cannady had known each other since childhood; there were some suggestions that they were lovers.[2] Neal was arrested about two hours after the discovery of Cannady's body.[3]\nBecause the evidence gathered against Neal was circumstantial at best, it was not enough to prove that he was guilty of the crime.[2] The evidence included bloody clothes that were found at the home he shared with his mother, as well as a bloody piece of fabric which Sheriff Chambliss claimed fit a tear in Neal's shirt.[2] Neal reportedly had cuts on his hands and was inconsistent in his descriptions as to where they had come from; he gave three different explanations for the cuts, with one being that he had gotten them while fixing a fence, one being that he had cut his hands in a fight, and one being that he had cut them jumping a fence.[2] In addition, Neal was missing a ring on his pocket watch. A common, standard watch ring had been found near the spot where Cannady had been murdered.[2] No tests were done on the murder weapon to determine if Neal's fingerprints were on it.[2] The sheriff moved Neal's mother Mrs. Annie Smith and aunt Sallie Smith to an undisclosed jail to prevent them from being harmed by a lynch mob. The prosecution told the coroner's jury that the women said they had washed Neal's bloody clothes.[2]\nHoward Kester, a white preacher and activist, was investigating the case on behalf of the NAACP. He learned other accounts of Cannady's murder from members of the black community.[5][2] One was that she had been murdered by a white man, who later asked Neal's mother and aunt to wash his clothes and possibly offered them payment.[2] Another was that a white man from Malone, in Jackson County, had already confessed to killing Cannady, and that he had given Neal money in exchange for trading clothes with him afterward.[2] Neither of these rumors was ever proven, nor was Kester able to discover more helpful evidence.[2] Kester said that perhaps Neal and Cannady had had a secret, consensual love affair. He suggested that maybe Neal had killed her out of anger if their relationship ended. He had no evidence for this, and such an affair was denied by the Cannady family.\nBefore the coroner's jury had charged Neal and before much evidence had been found, lynch mobs began forming and searching for Neal.[2] Newspapers contributed to agitation by running stories about him as a suspect a day after the crime was discovered.[2][6] Due to lynch mobs trying to find and capture Neal, the sheriff moved him multiple times to different jails:[2] from the Bay County Jail in Panama City, to Camp Walton, then to Pensacola on the morning of October 20.[2] In Pensacola, Sheriff Herbert E. Gandy did not want to keep him in the Escambia County, Florida jail because it was not believed to be sturdy enough to withstand an attack. A lynch mob had already recently attempted to raid the jail for Neal.[2] Neal was moved briefly to Fort Barrancas at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, before finally being moved to the Escambia County, Alabama jail in Brewton, Alabama.[2] In order to keep Neal's location a secret, he was booked on charges of vagrancy under the alias of John Smith.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Shauna Taylor Case was a 2018 criminal trial involving the investigation and conviction of Shauna Dee Taylor, a Floridian housewife who had poisoned her prematurely-born infant daughter (unnamed in public sources) with Tylenol iron supplements, causing acute liver damage due to iron poisoning, from which the child unexpectedly survived.[1][2][3] The case rose to further prominence in 2019 when two of Shauna's then-grown adult children, Annie and Joshua Taylor, appeared publicly on the daytime talk show Dr. Phil, reporting that all 10 children documented as being under Shauna's care at one point or another, including themselves, had been subjected to severe physical, verbal and medical abuse.[4] Shauna was diagnosed with Munchausen by proxy and convicted to 12 years in prison for aggravated child abuse, with 15 months of parole to follow.[5]\nShauna and her husband Bill Taylor lived in various US states in the time in which they had their children, having amassed a family of 10 children, later having several of these children removed from their care due to allegations of abuse in California and Arizona.[6] Bill claimed to have no knowledge of Shauna's abuse of the children, arguing that he was absent from the family most of the time for work-related reasons. He divorced Shauna after the poisoning of their infant daughter. \"The time that these poisonings occurred, I had been out of the home already for six months and I was working six days a week, 10 hours a day,\" Bill said in 2019. \"On the several visits to the emergency room, I was scratching my head thinking, my gosh. How could all my kids have such severe medical issues?\"[7]\nIt is unclear to what extent Shauna abused the children under her care. Annie Taylor alleged on Dr. Phil that she had been given unprescribed insulin in glasses of milk by Shauna when she was a child, with no medical advice from a doctor or nurse. Annie had also had two spinal taps, seemingly for no apparent recorded medical reason. Josh Taylor reported children, including himself, being put in dog cages as a form of humiliation while Shauna shouted profanities at them, being force-fed milk and money (metal coins that he would be made to swallow whole), and forcibly drugged with various over the counter and prescription medications. Shauna reportedly had an obsessive fixation on injuring the livers of her children and would damage their internal organs with repeated drugging and beatings. Annie and Josh reported that they continued to suffer the effects of this abuse into adulthood.[8][9] These allegations made on Dr. Phil were later verified by ABC News, which revealed that Shauna's parental rights to the children had long-since been terminated.[10]\nShauna Taylor was 40 years old and a resident of Macclenny, Florida when she had an infant daughter born premature in late 2012, whom she began bringing to emergency rooms in 2013 for unspecified illnesses. The child was presenting with severe liver damage.[11] According to investigators, in each of Shauna's initial visits to the hospital, Shauna included \"exaggerated\" and falsified symptoms of the child's health, having not yet been able to poison the child's liver until she had enough iron pills ready for doing so. In the third visit, the child was said to have experienced liver failure. \"While the child was admitted to the hospital, [Shauna] would be there with the child and while she was there, she would administer the Tylenol to continue the abuse,\" according to Baker County Sheriff's Office Sergeant Tracie Benton, the lead detective on the case. Ultrasounds of the girl's liver showed abnormalities, and blood tests turned up high levels of iron.[12] Around that time, investigators began receiving anonymous tips claiming that Taylor had Munchausen by proxy and was abusing the child. Those tipsters also informed investigators about a fundraising campaign online for the child, started by Shauna for the purposes of collecting money. Medical experts were able to test the child for certain poisons related to liver failure and determined there was iron in the child's system well above regular levels.  Eventually, after being removed from Shauna's care and given proper healthcare, the child's liver function returned to normal while she was in the hospital. Because the child survived, her name was never revealed by public news sources, and Shauna moved on to another state for habitation, leaving the case largely buried.[13]\nIn 2018, the Shauna Taylor Case was re-investigated; the abuse of Annie, Josh and Shauna's other 8 children then came out as news sources began uncovering old records of situations where Child Protective Services had removed various children from Shauna's care.[14] Shauna was arrested in Albany, New York, extradited to Florida and tried for the intentional 2013 poisoning of her infant daughter, by the point at which roughly 5 years had passed since the incident had occurred. Shauna had initially pleaded not guilty.[15] It was revealed that Shauna had a diagnosis of Munchausen by proxy, a psychological condition in which an individual imposes an appearance of a fake illness, or an actual illness, on a proxy, in most cases a minor child, for sympathy, money or attention. In Shauna's case, she had attempted to destroy her child's liver for the purposes of imposing an illness; this was not unheard of in the United States at that time, as cases such as the murder of Garnett Spears and the Gypsy Rose Blanchard case had been in the media in recent years.[16] Shauna was convicted of aggravated child abuse and neglect and sentenced to 12 years in prison with 15 months of parole. Bill Taylor, who had maintained his innocence, was never charged or convicted of any crime or cited as Shauna's accomplice. By the time Shauna was sent to prison, Bill had separated from her and had lost contact with most of his 10 children.[17][18]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Carol City murders were a series of murders that took place predominantly in Carol City, Florida and in and around Miami-Dade County between October 1974 and January 1978. The murders were committed by American mass murderer and serial killer John Errol Ferguson (February 27, 1948 \u2013 August 5, 2013)[1] who murdered at least eight people but is believed to have killed up to twelve. He was aided in six of the murders by two accomplices: Marvin Francois (January 18, 1946 \u2013 May 29, 1985)[2] and Beauford White (October 29, 1945 \u2013 August 28, 1987).[2]\nOn July 27, 1977, Ferguson, Francois, and White entered a drug house in Carol City where they tied up a total of eight people and shot all of them in the head execution-style. Only two of the eight survived. At the time, the incident was the largest case of mass murder in Miami-Dade County history. Months after the massacre, Ferguson murdered a teenage couple in Hialeah after raping the female victim. He is also suspected to be responsible for the May 1977 murders of an elderly couple and is suspected of killing a further two men in 1974.[3]\nFerguson, Francois, and White were all eventually captured, sentenced to death, and executed by the state of Florida. Francois was executed in the electric chair on May 29, 1985, followed by White, who was executed in the electric chair on August 28, 1987. Ferguson was executed over two decades later by lethal injection on August 5, 2013, following years of appeals over his sanity.[4][5]\nFerguson, the fourth oldest of eight children, had been known to psychiatrists since he was 10. His father died when he was 13 and his mother had managed to take care of the children on her own. Ferguson dropped out of school after repeating 9th grade three times.[6] Ferguson had his first police encounter when he was 13 after being caught driving someone else's car without their consent. He would continue to get in trouble with the police throughout his youth. In 1969, Ferguson tried to kill a police officer after a traffic stop. He disarmed officer Edward Hartman, ordered him on his knees, and told him to beg for his life. Hartman complied, but also slipped a revolver out of his boot. Ferguson fired four shots at Hartman but missed all of them. Hartman then shot Ferguson four times.[6]\nIn 1975, a court-appointed psychiatrist diagnosed John Ferguson as \"dangerous to himself and others ... homicidal ... a man who should not be released under any circumstances.\" Another psychiatrist said Ferguson's potential for recovery was minimal and that the probability of him returning to a life of crime was very high. He described Ferguson as \"explosive ... a dangerous person who cannot cope with day to day living.\" Ferguson bragged to his friends that he had feigned insanity and misled the doctors. A woman who knew him later said, \"He was into psychology. He told us he psyched them out. He'd say things like 'See that airplane flying in the room?'\"[6]\nAfter repeatedly escaping from a hospital, Ferguson, who had previously been acquitted of six robberies and two assaults on the grounds of insanity, was sent to the more secure Florida State Hospital. In June 1976, doctors said Ferguson's treatment was complete and that further hospitalization was not necessary. Ferguson was sent to Miami to face charges of resisting arrest after a hospital escape. Although a psychiatrist warned that he was \"unpredictable and a danger to himself and others\", a judge ruled Ferguson competent and later accepted a guilty plea. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison and two years of probation, and released 225 days later.[6]\nFrancois, whose parents were not married, had an impoverished upbringing. His father was a deadbeat heroin addict who brought other addicts into the home to take heroin in front of his son and beat Francois when he would not fight with the other children. Francois's mother was a sex worker who did not do much for her son. She married, but Francois's stepfather abused him. Although Francois did not finish school, he did obtain his GED.[7]\nWhite had a lengthy criminal record dating back to July 1963, and was on parole for assault with intent to commit rape at the time of the murders.[8]\nOn October 30, 1974, James Ward, a 40-year-old mental hospital escapee, was murdered. His body was dumped in Collier County and he was killed by a shotgun blast. On November 1, the body of another man named Joseph Walters was found near railroad tracks in Miami by a freight train employee. Walters had also been killed by a shotgun blast but had additionally been shot repeatedly with a handgun. There were no leads in the Walters case until February 1977, when the mother of the man convicted of Ward's murder made contact with Linda Blue, the lead homicide detective who was investigating the case. Convicted killer Edward Eugene Oliver had been spotted leaving the area where Ward's body had been found and was ultimately convicted of murdering him. Oliver made contact with Blue and claimed he wanted to talk about both murders.[9][10]\n",

According to records, Lindsey has a prior record for non violent crimes such as grand theft and trespassing.[1]\nAlthough he attended school on the day of the shooting, he had missed 40 days during the school year.  Gibbs High School former principal Kevin Gordon spoke with Lindsey about cutting class. The principal and his reading intervention teacher said the teenaged suspect always complied with authority. One teacher, Karen Morse, stated that he was a typical teen who would \"strive for that teacher attention to do his best.\" Off campus, Lindsey appeared to be a different kid. Lindsey's Facebook page showed he had a gang name.\nSt. Petersburg mayor Bill Foster recognized Lindsey when he saw the mugshot. He met with the teen inside his home during a 2010 Outreach the Community event. It was after his first arrest of grand theft. Foster said that the teen impressed him the most and had a goal to succeed in life. Foster went on to say he wanted Lindsey tried as an adult.[2]\nOn February 21, 2011, officer David Crawford, 46, was responding to a call of a suspicious person near Tropicana Field late that night. The caller stated that a man was holding a brick in his back yard then jumped the fence. The caller thought he might be a burglar. Officer Crawford arrived to the area and spotted the person then got out of his vehicle. At 10:37\u00a0p.m., Donald J. Ziglar, a fellow officer, noticed and reported an exchange of gunfire.

More than 200 officers from different agencies across Tampa Bay poured into the city to take part in the massive manhunt for the suspect.[3]\nThe manhunt came to an end the night of February 22, 2011. Upon receiving tips from the community, police raided a home and arrested 16-year-old Nicholas Lindsey. Lindsey originally offered different accounts of the events, but eventually admitted information that conformed with the evidence police had already gathered, said St. Petersburg Police Chief Chuck Harmon. Police also stated that \"he broke down and cried\" and that Lindsey admitted to throwing the gun in a nearby creek. He was booked into the Pinellas Juvenile Assessment Center.[4][5][6]\nLindsey's mother, Deneen Sweat told the St. Petersburg Times she suspected her son may have been involved in the shooting after she heard the description of the suspect. \"I told my son, man up and tell what happened.\" Deneen Sweat told WFTS. Sweat was with her son when he confessed to police.[7]\nThe shooting garnered multiple emotions from the public. Questions on how a 16-year-old could obtain a gun emerged as well as the need for Nicholas Lindsey to be tried as an adult. Law enforcement took the death exceptionally hard. Crawford was described as a family man who loved horses, people and enjoyed working the night shift. He left behind a wife and a 24-year-old daughter.[4]\nMy thoughts and prayers remain with the family and loved-ones of Officer Crawford during this extremely difficult time. I am hopeful that they might find some relief knowing that a suspect has been identified and is behind bars.[4]",

        "paragraph": "Robert Tyrone Hayes (born March 12, 1982) is an American serial killer who has been convicted of three murders in the Daytona Beach, Florida area between December 2005 and February 2006.[2] DNA tests have also linked him to a fourth murder committed in March 2016. In addition, he remains the prime suspect in the murder of another woman in December 2007.\nThe first three murders that were committed in Daytona Beach, Florida garnered high media attention, and before Hayes' identification, the perpetrator was nicknamed The Daytona Beach Killer.[3][4][5] Investigators were not able to close in on a suspect in time. In December 2007, the murder of a woman in the same area caused a re-investigation to be brought forward, but again, Hayes remained elusive.[6] In December 2016, DNA tests on a woman found murdered in Palm Beach County in March 2016 matched DNA found on the original three murdered women.[7][8]\nOn September 15, 2019, authorities charged Hayes with one count of first-degree murder based upon DNA tests.[9] On September 16, he was charged on three additional counts of first-degree murder.[10][11][12] Additional testing after his arrest confirmed the link.[12] Investigators had identified Hayes after identifying his family members through genetic genealogy, a tactic that has been used to solve numerous cold cases, most infamously the Golden State Killer.[13] In February 2022, Hayes was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder and the following month was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole.[2][14]\nRobert Tyrone Hayes was born on March 12, 1982 in West Palm Beach, Florida, the youngest of four children.[15] Growing up, Hayes' was raised primarily by his mother, as his father had been murdered shortly after his birth, and according to later reports Hayes received an uncertain amount of abuse as a child.[16] When he was young, presumably a teenager, he was molested by a family member of a similar age. He was described as chubby in his adolescence, resulting in Hayes often being bullied.[15]\nNicknamed \"Squeaky\" by friends and family, Hayes was described as someone who was always there for people, friendly with neighbors, outspoken, and recited poetry in Miami.[15] He was known by friends to have an active sex life, attending sex parties, suspected of inviting prostitutes over, and at point he invited a family member to a sex party.[15] He was also described as someone with a good sense of humor and a fun, positive attitude.[17] Hayes had a girlfriend named in the 2000s, whom he had a child with.\nBetween 2000 and 2006, Hayes attended Bethune\u2013Cookman College, now Bethune\u2013Cookman University, studying criminal justice.[10][1] He graduated with a degree in criminal justice.[18] He was known to be helpful to friends and acquaintances. Friends also explained Hayes had an interest in cooking, and attempted to start his own cooking business in Charlotte, North Carolina.[17]\nThe first known victim was 45-year-old Laquetta Mae Gunther, who was found in an alley on December 26, 2005.[19] She had been shot in the back of the head. DNA was recovered from the scene.[3] Laquetta had gone missing two days prior on Christmas Eve, when she was making dinner plans with her friend Stacey Dittmer.[6] When the time came, Laquetta never showed up. She was known to have worked as a prostitute.[6] The second victim was 34-year-old Julie Green, found January 14, 2006. She was also known to have worked as a prostitute.[4] She had also been shot in the back of the head. No DNA was recovered, but tire tracks were found. The tires were for a 2003 Taurus or Sable and in fact the exact tires were later found.[3]\nJust over a month later, on February 24, 2006 police found the body of Iwana Patton, 35, on a dirt road. She had been shot, but not in the back of the head, and possibly had struggled with her killer. DNA was recovered, along with a shell casing that allowed police to identify the make and model of pistol used (.40-caliber Smith & Wesson Sigma Series VE).[3] Ballistics from recovered bullets and recovered DNA matched.[4][5]\nAuthorities received an anonymous telephone call describing the location of Patton's body, but the caller was eventually identified and questioned, and is not a suspect in the killings. All three women are believed to have worked as sex workers in the Daytona Beach area.[4] Police believe the victims voluntarily accompanied their killer, possibly in a vehicle, and were subsequently murdered and dumped in the same area of Daytona Beach. The killer did not attempt to conceal the bodies.\n",

        "paragraph": "Abraham Lee Shakespeare (April 24, 1966 \u2013 c.\u2009April 7, 2009) was a casual laborer from the US who won a $30 million lottery jackpot in Florida, receiving $17 million in 2006. In 2009, his family declared him missing, and in January 2010 his body was found buried under a concrete slab in the backyard of an acquaintance. Dorice \"Dee Dee\" Moore was convicted of his murder and is now serving life in prison without the possibility of parole.[1]\nThe Florida Lotto winning ticket worth thirty million dollars was sold at a Town Star convenience store in Frostproof, Florida, on November 15, 2006.[2] On that day, Abraham Lee Shakespeare and co-worker Michael Ford were headed toward Miami when they stopped briefly at the convenience store in Frostproof to buy drinks and cigarettes. Ford got out of the truck and asked Shakespeare if he wanted a soda. Shakespeare instead asked Ford to buy him two lottery tickets. Shakespeare said that he paid Ford $2 for the tickets out of the $5 he had on him that day.[3]\nFord later approached Shakespeare demanding a share of the jackpot of no less than $1 million, which Shakespeare refused to pay, prompting Ford to sue Shakespeare and alleging that Shakespeare stole lottery tickets out of Ford's wallet.[3] The jury did not believe Ford's stolen lottery tickets story and Shakespeare prevailed in the courts. Shakespeare had chosen a one-time, lump sum cash payment of $17 million.[4] He moved out of his working-class neighborhood in Lakeland, Florida and into a gated community.[5] Several months after his lottery win, apart from a $1 million home, his only other major purchases included a Nissan Altima and a Rolex watch from a pawnshop.[6] By late January 2010 the sheriff involved in the investigation of Shakespeare's disappearance told AP that the lottery money \"is gone now.\"[7]\nFriends stated Shakespeare had grown frustrated with the apparently constant appeals for money from both hangers-on and strangers. He told his brother, \"I'd have been better off broke,\" and told a childhood friend, \"I thought all these people were my friends, but then I realized all they want is just money.\"[1] One of these was Dorice Donegan \"Dee-Dee\" Moore, who launched a business with Shakespeare, Abraham Shakespeare LLC, giving herself control of the firm's funds. Moore subsequently withdrew $1 million and bought herself a Hummer, a Chevrolet Corvette and a truck before going on vacation. She later claimed that the money was a gift from Shakespeare.[5]\nOn November 9, 2009, Shakespeare's family reported him missing, stating that they had not seen him since April of that year. Family and friends had originally hoped that he had taken his money and was living on a beach in the Caribbean Sea. A tip-off led investigators to the backyard of a home purchased by Moore, where Shakespeare's body was found buried under 9 feet (2.7\u00a0m) of dirt under a newly constructed concrete slab.[1] Shakespeare was 42.[5]\nHillsborough County detectives say Shakespeare died April 6 or 7 in the single-story ranch home in Plant City.[8]  Police took Moore into custody on February 2, 2010, in connection with the murder of Shakespeare. A judge set a $1 million bond. The police stated Moore had tried to convince an acquaintance to unearth the body and move it a week after the death, and had continued to try to convince others that Shakespeare was still alive.[9] On February 19, 2010, Moore was formally charged with first degree murder.\nDorice Donegan \"Dee Dee\" Moore (born July 25, 1972) was the prime suspect in the death of Abraham Shakespeare. She was married to James Moore in 1992, and has a son born in 1995. In 2001, Moore was convicted of insurance fraud[10] and falsely reporting a crime; she served a year of probation. Moore filed for bankruptcy in 2002.\nBefore police found Shakespeare's body, Moore said Shakespeare had decided to leave town and had gone to Texas, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, or Orlando, Florida, or was sick in a hospital. Moore also said that Shakespeare was tired of people asking him for money, so she helped him leave town.[5] After police found his body under a concrete slab, in the backyard of the home she put in her boyfriend's name, Moore told police different versions of what happened to Shakespeare. Moore in turn blamed drug dealers, a lawyer and her 14-year-old son.[11] She later said she killed Shakespeare in self-defence.[9] Soon after the disappearance of Shakespeare, Moore, who was living in Shakespeare's house, kept using his cell phone and sending text messages to his friends and relatives, pretending she was Shakespeare. Recipients thought they did not sound like him and were suspicious because Shakespeare was illiterate.[5][11] When people texted Shakespeare's phone back with questions that could not be answered by Moore, no response was given.[11]\nDuring the same time that Moore was trying to make it appear as though Shakespeare was alive, she tried to find a person who would take the blame for Shakespeare's death for fifty thousand dollars. She also offered to pay someone to dig up and move Shakespeare's body to another location.[12] Property records show that Moore's company, American Medical Professionals, bought Shakespeare's house.[1] Moore told investigators she paid Shakespeare $655,000 for his home and paid $185,000 for outstanding loans (which were actually worth much more) to others; however, there is no evidence showing she paid Shakespeare anything.[5] Moore offered the mother of one of Shakespeare's two sons a $200,000 home if she would lie to detectives and tell them she had seen him recently. She also paid $5,000 to a relative of Shakespeare's to give his mother a birthday card and imply it was from him.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "James Bailey Cash Jr. (born August 2, 1932) was a five-year-old child from Princeton, Florida who was smothered to death during his kidnapping by Franklin Pierce McCall in 1938.\nMcCall successfully collected a large ransom for the dead child, having gone so far as to plant and publicly \"discover\" one of his own ransom notes, leading the authorities to detain him as a suspect. After several days of interrogation, McCall confessed to Cash's abduction and directed authorities to the hidden ransom money and the child's remains.\nDuring the 1930s, the United States experienced a series of \"ransom kidnappings\" committed explicitly for financial gain, with victims generally from either middle-class or wealthy families.[1][2] The most widely publicized ransom kidnapping at the time was the 1932 kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh Jr., the only son of the record-setting aviator Charles Lindbergh.[1][2] Like James Bailey Cash Jr., Lindbergh's son died during the abduction, but a ransom was sought nevertheless. The Lindbergh case inspired Congress to pass legislation that allowed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate kidnappings in any state under certain conditions, one of which was a ransom demand.[3] Despite this legislation, ransom kidnappings continued to be a major concern at the time when James Bailey Cash Jr. was abducted in May 1938.[4]\nOn the night of May 28, 1938, five-year-old James Bailey Cash Jr., nicknamed \"Skeegie\", was kidnapped in the middle of the night by Franklin Pierce McCall.[4] McCall was a local laborer and a former tenant of the Cash family.[5] After putting James Jr. to bed, sometime after 9:30 pm, his mother, Vera Cash locked up the house and left to meet her husband at the family-owned general store.[4] Sometime later, McCall entered the house and used a handkerchief to quiet the boy before taking him from the home, smothering him to death in the process.[6] McCall hid the boy's body about a half-mile away from his home.[4] By 10:10 PM, both parents returned home to find the boy missing and began to search the surrounding area. The search effort was later joined by neighbors and local Boy Scouts.[7][8]\nSoon after the murder, by 11:00 pm the same night, McCall began to intimidate John Emanuel and Geraldine Barnes, a local African American farming couple.[9] At first, McCall attempted to get Emanuel to speak with him and to deliver a letter to Bailey Cash, Cash Jr's father. Emanuel, however, refused and McCall threatened to shoot Emanuel before leaving.[10] The couple then left their home, to hide out at a friends home for safety.[11] Meanwhile, Beatrice Cash, a relative of John Baily Cash who lived in the same town, found a letter wrapped around the door knob on her front door, which instructed the reader to go to a specific house in Princeton's African American neighborhood where they would find further instructions.[12]\nThe note was addressed to J.B. Cash. Beatrice woke up her husband and drove over to the Cash residence to help with the search.[12] The house mentioned in the letter was the house belonging to Emanuel. By midnight the search was beginning to end, by now many of them were angry over the disappearance and by 1:00 AM, Bailey Cash and the rest of the family went over to Emanuel's house, surrounding it while Bailey and Asbury began to look for the note.[13] They soon found the note underneath the door of the house.[13] This note was the first of a series of ransom letters that the Cash family would receive.\nThe first note was composed of multiple sheets of paper with a series of demands written throughout:\nThe Cash family was to provide 10,000 dollars in various types of bills with serial numbers not in an order and deliver carry the money in a shoe box to Homestead, where they would drive along the road until they saw a flash two times, at which point they would leave the money on the roadside and continue the route. If Bailey complied, and kept the ransom secret, the note promised that John Baily Jr. would be safely returned.[14]\nBy 3:00 AM that morning, Special Agent Arthur Rutzen of the FBI had been contacted by a Dade County Sheriff, R.B. Eavanson.[15] They would meet up later at the Roberts Hotel at Miami Beach to further discuss the case. After their discussion another investigator, Samuel K. McKee, joined the case.  McKee and Rutzen went to the Cash home to continue the investigation.[16]\n",

In the early sixties he moved to Montreal where he produced \"Like Young\", at CFCF-TV, a highly successful teen music/dance show starring Jim McKenna that was eventually picked up and syndicated by Dick Clark Productions. Following his years at CBS, and CFCF-TV Shalleck was a producer at The Network for Continuing Medical Education and then formed his own production company (AJ Shalleck Productions) and produced a number of low-budget children's animated films and television episodes.\nIn 1977, he approached Margret Rey about producing a television series based on Curious George, which led to the 1980 television show. Shalleck and Rey wrote more than 100 short episodes for the series. In addition, they collaborated on a number of children's books and audiobooks. (Some of these books list Rey as the author and Shalleck as the editor, while others reverse the credits.)\nIn his retirement, Shalleck created the company \"Reading By GRAMPS\" and visited local elementary schools, bookstores, and other events to read books to children and promote literacy. However, he also experienced financial problems and was forced to supplement his income with part-time jobs.[2] He most recently worked as a bookseller for Borders Books in Boynton Beach, Florida.\nOn February 7, 2006, a few days before the theatrical release of a Curious George animated motion picture, Shalleck's body was discovered, partially hidden, at his home in Boynton Beach, Florida, a victim of a robbery/homicide.[3] His attackers were tracked down using the victim's phone records.

The group had intended to travel to Canada, but first drove to California, where Kimyala obtained her birth certificate.\nTwo weeks later, Mayer and Ohering were found dead in a murder\u2013suicide at a rest area in Collier County, Florida. Eight days later, Kimyala Henson's body was discovered in a rural area near Pyramid Lake in Nevada; she had been bludgeoned with a hatchet and shot to death. Mayer and Oehring were assumed responsible for Kimyala's murder, and evidence showed that Mayer had assumed Henson's identity, and that she and Oehring had used Kimyala's credit cards to purchase gasoline and food. According to subsequent reports, Oehring allegedly led a Satanist group in Stewartsville, Missouri, of which Mayer was a member.\nDespite widespread searches, neither Shaina Kirkpatrick nor Shausha Henson were located, and as of 2022, their whereabouts remain unknown.\nThe siblings, Shaina Kirkpatrick (age 3) and Shausha Henson (age approximately 2 months) departed on a road trip from their home in Portland, Oregon, with their mother, Kimyala Henson. Kimyala was accompanied by her childhood friend,[6] Christina Noel Mayer, and Frank Lee Oehring, a fugitive from Stewartsville, Missouri wanted by police after the attempted murder of his ex-wife.[7] Mayer introduced Oehring to Kimyala as her husband, using the pseudonym of Curtis. Oehring reportedly led a Satanist group in Missouri, of which Mayer was an alleged member.[8]\nMayer and Oehring had made a surprise visit to the Portland area on approximately April 2, 2001, claiming they were scouting locations with the intent to possibly move there.[7] Mayer was able to contact Kimyala using a phone book.[7] The former childhood friends spent a week together before Oehring offered to take Mayer, Kimyala, and her daughters on a vacation to British Columbia, Canada, an invitation Kimyala accepted.[7]\nKimyala and her daughters were last seen at a hotel in Redding, California on April 5, 2001, accompanied by Mayer and Oehring. Earlier that day, the group had stopped in Sacramento to obtain Kimyala's birth certificate, as it is believed Mayer and Oehring convinced her she would need the document to enter Canada.[7] Two days after the group had embarked on their road trip, Kimyala's mother died in Portland; when family members attempted to contact her by phone to notify her of the news, they were unable to reach her.[7]\nOn April 20, 2001, an off-duty deputy found Mayer shot to death with a .22 caliber rifle in an apparent murder\u2013suicide beside a picnic table at a rest area in Collier County, Florida.[6][7] Oehring, who had shot himself in the head nearby, was still alive. He was flighted to Lee Memorial Hospital in Naples, where he died later that day.[9] In a garbage can at the rest area, Kimyala's birth certificate was discovered by authorities, torn in half.[6] Further investigation yielded that Kimyala's credit cards had been used to purchase gasoline and food through numerous states between April 6 and April 9, 2001, and that Mayer had fraudulently obtained a Nevada state identification card using Kimyala's identity.[6] The Kia Sephia that the group had traveled in was left parked at the rest area; inside the car, a diaper bag was found, but no other evidence of the missing children could be located.[6]\nOn April 28, 2001, eight days after the discovery of Mayer and Oehring, Kimyala Henson's body was found partially buried near Pyramid Lake, approximately 37 miles (60\u00a0km) north of Wadsworth, Nevada.[8][6] She had been bludgeoned with a hatchet and shot to death. Ballistics analysis concluded that Kimyala had been shot with the same gun used in Mayer and Oehring's murder\u2013suicide.[10]\nAs of 2022[update], the whereabouts of Kirkpatrick and Henson remain unknown.\n",

        "paragraph": "William Mansfield, Jr. (born 1956) is an American serial killer, child molester and sex offender, responsible for the murders of five women and girls between 1975 and 1980. He buried the bodies of four victims at the family home in Spring Hill, Florida, and later traveled with his brother to California, where he raped and strangled a Watsonville woman. He was convicted of the latter homicide, and later pleaded guilty to the previous murders to avoid the death penalty in Florida, receiving four life sentences.\nWilliam Mansfield, Jr. was born in 1956 in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the eldest in a family of five children. His father, William Sr., was a convicted child molester who had served sentences in both Michigan and Nevada,[1] who often encouraged fights between his sons.[2] Despite this the younger Mansfield claimed that he had a good upbringing and got along with his family, but that changed when he was 14, when he dropped out of school and altered his birth certificate so he could serve in the Army. While serving, he became an alcoholic; not long after this, he also began experimenting with various drugs. As a result of his addiction he was sent for treatment at a Veterans Administration Hospital in Tampa in 1978 and 1980. In 1975, he married Phyllis Spielmaker and had two children with her, but they divorced in 1979, his ex-wife deciding to stay in Grand Rapids with the kids.[3] According to Spielmaker, Billy, a closeted bisexual, often brought men from gay bars home and had sex with them in front of her, and one time discussed a murder with her. She described him as easygoing, but very violent when drunk.[2]\nOn New Year's Eve in 1975, a 15-year-old girl from Parkman, Ohio, named Elaine Louise Zeigler went missing from a KOA campground near Brooksville. She was on vacation with her mother Betty and step-father Blaine Chalker,[4] and was last seen going to the camp showers. By the next day Elaine still had not returned, and her parents reported her missing. Search parties organized by the local police department and volunteers were spread out to search the area in order to find Zeigler, who, at that time, was thought to be a runaway.[5] Several people claimed that they had seen a girl matching her description riding a motorbike, and when asked where she was going, the girl claimed to be returning to her home state of Ohio. On the other hand, there were also reported sightings of Elaine talking to a man in his twenties near the shower area, and later entering his car, a light blue 1966 Ford Fairlane with Florida license plates.[6]\nAfter staying an additional week to aid in the search for their daughter, realizing that nothing could be done, the Chalkers returned to their home in Parkman without Elaine.[7]\nOn January 31, 1977, Billy pleaded guilty to a sexual misconduct charge against a babysitter in Grand Rapids, receiving six months' imprisonment and 36 months' probation. Not long after leaving jail he assaulted two teenagers in a rural area of the city, and was sent back to prison for violating the conditions of his parole. There he shared a cell with 27-year-old Albert Lee III, who confided to Mansfield that he had murdered an 11-year-old girl named Linda VanderVeen.[8][9] Using this information, Billy testified against Lee in exchange for a lesser sentence, and was released from jail after a year.[10]\nOn June 19, 1980, he forced 18-year-old Pamela Sherrell into his van and drove to a rented trailer, where he proceeded to hit her, cutting her lip and bruising her neck.[11] Sherrell reported the incident to the police, but when they went to arrest him, he was not there. On November 23, he was arrested in Santa Cruz, but posted bail and was set free again.[12]\nOn December 7, 1980, the half-naked body of 29-year-old Ren\u00e9 Saling was found at a drainage ditch at the side of the Buena Vista Road in Watsonville, California by passing motorists. A mother of three, Ren\u00e9 had been last seen by her husband Raymond the previous day. Her clothes had been torn apart, with her blouse and pants lowered to her ankles.[13] The coroner ruled the cause of death as strangulation.[14] Four days later, Billy and his 23-year-old brother, Gary, were arrested by a rookie police officer at Winnemucca, Nevada for questioning in Saling's murder. The two men lied about their identities and ages, but the officer noticed that their physical description matched the Mansfield brothers, and took them into custody at the Humboldt County jail.[15] On December 16, the two brothers were arraigned at a Watsonville court on murder charges concerning Saling's death. They were dubbed \"The Bag Brothers\" by the media,[10] due to the fact that they wore paper bags over their heads to protect the testimonies of any potential witnesses.[16] The Mansfields pleaded not guilty to the murder charges,[17] and were ordered to stand trial for Saling's murder by Justice John Marlo on February 4, 1981.[18][19]\nIn mid-March 1981, the Hernando County Sheriff's Department obtained a search warrant to excavate the Mansfield family property in Spring Hill, based on information provided by an informant who claimed that there was a body underneath the property. The authorities searched and dug through the area until they located a skull and bones in a shallow grave covered with a blanket.[20] Unsure if the bones were Zeigler's, they were sent for examination, where pathologist Dr. William Whitman concluded that they belonged to a female under 20 years of age.[21] Despite the search warrant naming only Zeigler, authorities, suspecting that there could possibly be more bodies, continued with the excavations.[22] Additional officers from Tampa and metal-detecting experts also aided in the excavations.[23]\nThe located body was tentatively identified as that of the missing Zeigler, based on the skeleton's characteristics, skull and missing tooth.[24][25] Jewelry was also located, but the Chalkers didn't recognize it as belonging to Elaine.[26] Over the following weeks, there were continuous excavations with varying success, with the investigators initially uncovering bones from chickens and cows.[27] On March 24, a small sack of human bones was found underneath the fireplace.[28] Encouraged by this discovery, investigators continued digging and plowing the water pipes and electrical wiring installed over the bodies.[27] Eventually, three more skeletons were unearthed, all belonging to young women. They were determined to be the following:\n",

        "paragraph": "The Carol City murders were a series of murders that took place predominantly in Carol City, Florida and in and around Miami-Dade County between October 1974 and January 1978. The murders were committed by American mass murderer and serial killer John Errol Ferguson (February 27, 1948 \u2013 August 5, 2013)[1] who murdered at least eight people but is believed to have killed up to twelve. He was aided in six of the murders by two accomplices: Marvin Francois (January 18, 1946 \u2013 May 29, 1985)[2] and Beauford White (October 29, 1945 \u2013 August 28, 1987).[2]\nOn July 27, 1977, Ferguson, Francois, and White entered a drug house in Carol City where they tied up a total of eight people and shot all of them in the head execution-style. Only two of the eight survived. At the time, the incident was the largest case of mass murder in Miami-Dade County history. Months after the massacre, Ferguson murdered a teenage couple in Hialeah after raping the female victim. He is also suspected to be responsible for the May 1977 murders of an elderly couple and is suspected of killing a further two men in 1974.[3]\nFerguson, Francois, and White were all eventually captured, sentenced to death, and executed by the state of Florida. Francois was executed in the electric chair on May 29, 1985, followed by White, who was executed in the electric chair on August 28, 1987. Ferguson was executed over two decades later by lethal injection on August 5, 2013, following years of appeals over his sanity.[4][5]\nFerguson, the fourth oldest of eight children, had been known to psychiatrists since he was 10. His father died when he was 13 and his mother had managed to take care of the children on her own. Ferguson dropped out of school after repeating 9th grade three times.[6] Ferguson had his first police encounter when he was 13 after being caught driving someone else's car without their consent. He would continue to get in trouble with the police throughout his youth. In 1969, Ferguson tried to kill a police officer after a traffic stop. He disarmed officer Edward Hartman, ordered him on his knees, and told him to beg for his life. Hartman complied, but also slipped a revolver out of his boot. Ferguson fired four shots at Hartman but missed all of them. Hartman then shot Ferguson four times.[6]\nIn 1975, a court-appointed psychiatrist diagnosed John Ferguson as \"dangerous to himself and others ... homicidal ... a man who should not be released under any circumstances.\" Another psychiatrist said Ferguson's potential for recovery was minimal and that the probability of him returning to a life of crime was very high. He described Ferguson as \"explosive ... a dangerous person who cannot cope with day to day living.\" Ferguson bragged to his friends that he had feigned insanity and misled the doctors. A woman who knew him later said, \"He was into psychology. He told us he psyched them out. He'd say things like 'See that airplane flying in the room?'\"[6]\nAfter repeatedly escaping from a hospital, Ferguson, who had previously been acquitted of six robberies and two assaults on the grounds of insanity, was sent to the more secure Florida State Hospital. In June 1976, doctors said Ferguson's treatment was complete and that further hospitalization was not necessary. Ferguson was sent to Miami to face charges of resisting arrest after a hospital escape. Although a psychiatrist warned that he was \"unpredictable and a danger to himself and others\", a judge ruled Ferguson competent and later accepted a guilty plea. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison and two years of probation, and released 225 days later.[6]\nFrancois, whose parents were not married, had an impoverished upbringing. His father was a deadbeat heroin addict who brought other addicts into the home to take heroin in front of his son and beat Francois when he would not fight with the other children. Francois's mother was a sex worker who did not do much for her son. She married, but Francois's stepfather abused him. Although Francois did not finish school, he did obtain his GED.[7]\nWhite had a lengthy criminal record dating back to July 1963, and was on parole for assault with intent to commit rape at the time of the murders.[8]\nOn October 30, 1974, James Ward, a 40-year-old mental hospital escapee, was murdered. His body was dumped in Collier County and he was killed by a shotgun blast. On November 1, the body of another man named Joseph Walters was found near railroad tracks in Miami by a freight train employee. Walters had also been killed by a shotgun blast but had additionally been shot repeatedly with a handgun. There were no leads in the Walters case until February 1977, when the mother of the man convicted of Ward's murder made contact with Linda Blue, the lead homicide detective who was investigating the case. Convicted killer Edward Eugene Oliver had been spotted leaving the area where Ward's body had been found and was ultimately convicted of murdering him. Oliver made contact with Blue and claimed he wanted to talk about both murders.[9][10]\n",

Henyard committed the murders with an accomplice, 14-year-old Alfonza Smalls (born August 18, 1978). Smalls received a life sentence since he was too young to be executed.\nOn the evening of January 30, 1993, Dorothy Lewis and her daughters arrived at a Winn-Dixie supermarket in Eustis. As Lewis, the eventual survivor, and her daughters, the victims, entered the Winn-Dixie, she noticed a few people sitting on a bench near the doors. After Lewis exited the store with Jamilya, age 7, and Jasmine, age 3, she walked to her car and placed her daughters in the front passenger seat.[3]\nAs Lewis crossed the rear of the car to get to the driver's side, she noticed Alfonza Smalls approaching her. Smalls then revealed a gun tucked into his waistband. Lewis and her daughters were ordered into the back of the car as Smalls and Henyard entered the front. The Lewis car left town with Henyard driving and Smalls issuing directions. Prior to the abduction of Lewis and her daughters, a witness observed Henyard and Smalls loitering outside of the Winn-Dixie. During the drive, Smalls repeatedly demanded that Lewis keep her crying daughters quiet. When Lewis pleaded with the teens to keep her and release her children, Smalls said \"No, we can't do that.\"[4][5] When Henyard heard Lewis praying, he told her \"This ain't Jesus, this is Satan.\"[3]\nLater, Henyard, following Smalls's directions pulled the car over at a remote area and took Lewis out of the car. Henyard then raped her as she begged him not to do it in front of her children. At one point, she tried to grab a nearby gun, but Smalls grabbed it first, taunted her, and then also raped her. Henyard then told Lewis to sit on the ground. When she hesitated, and Henyard shot her in the leg and forced her to the ground. The two got into a struggle, and Smalls came over to help Henyard. Henyard then shot Lewis an additional three times at close range, wounding her in the mouth, neck, and head. After she was unconscious, Henyard and Smalls rolled her over to the shoulder of the road.[5][3]\nLewis survived, however, and several hours later regained consciousness and went to a nearby house for help. The occupants contacted the police and Lewis collapsed and waited for the officers to arrive. As Henyard and Smalls drove away from the scene of the shooting, Jamilya and Jasmine Lewis repeatedly pleaded for their mother. Henyard pulled the car over after a short period of time and removed the girls from the car. Henyard and Smalls took the girls away from the road, out of the clear view of passersby, and Henyard killed the girls; Jamilya was shot through the top of her head while Jasmine was shot in her left eye.[6] Henyard and Smalls then threw their bodies into some brush over a fence.[3]\nSmalls, Henyard, and a third individual arrived at the home of Bryant Smith in a blue car. Henyard boasted about raping and killing Lewis, unaware that she was still alive. He also showed Smith the gun he used. Later that evening, Henyard went by the Smalls' residence where Colinda Smalls, Alfonza's sister, noticed blood on Henyard's hands. Henyard told her the blood was from a minor knife accident.[3]\nOn January 31, the next day, Henyard's aunt, Linda Miller, agreed to drive him to Smalls' residence so that Henyard could speak with Smalls. Henyard made a trip to the Eustis Police Department that same Sunday claiming to have information concerning the Lewis case. He offered knowledge of the crime, and claimed that he was present at the scene of the crime. Henyard's initial story pointed to Smalls and another individual as the perpetrators. However, when an officer noticed blood spots on Henyard's socks, he admitted to kidnapping, raping and shooting Lewis, yet maintained that he did not shoot her daughters. The police apprehended Smalls and discovered the murder weapon after a search of his bedroom.[3]\nAnother teenager, 16-year-old Manuel Yon Jr., was arrested for providing Henyard and Smalls with a change of clothes after the murders.[7]\nHenyard and Smalls both attempted to blame each other for the girls' murders. However, they were both found guilty of two counts of first degree murder under the state's felony murder rule.[5] Henyard was sentenced to death on August 19, 1994,[citation needed] and sent to death row to await execution.\n",

Newspapers misreported the 16-year-old boy as \"35 years of age\". A mob of over 100 men as well as bloodhounds from Mulberry and Pebble was assembled to search for him but a local paper mentioned a possible lynching before any evidence was recovered or he was charged.\nRochelle was captured two days later by two black men, who evaded the mob and turned Rochelle over to the Sheriff of Polk County in Lakeland, Florida. Ten minutes later, Rochelle was turned over to a mob.[3] The mob took Rochelle back to Bartow. A special train was arranged from Lakeland so that a large crowd of spectators could attend a \"barbecue\" in Bartow where Rochelle was to be the \"chief actor.\"[4] He was taken to the site of the Taggart murder, where he was chained to a barrel and doused with quantities of kerosene.

Her ex-boyfriend, Timothy \"Tracey\" Humphrey, and his wife Ashley Laney Humphrey, were convicted of her murder.\nTimothy Alvin \"Tracey\" Humphrey (born November 15, 1966)[1] was Sandee Rozzo's coworker at the time of her murder. They had previously been in a brief, but volatile relationship. He had committed an assault on Ms. Rozzo and criminal proceedings were in progress. The two had originally met at an Ybor City, Florida nightclub in November 2001 where Humphrey worked as a doorman and Sandee was a bartender.[2] Humphrey had a long previous criminal record of convictions for motor vehicle theft, kidnapping and aggravated assault.[1] The following February, Humphrey was arrested for felony battery after allegedly beating and sexually assaulting Sandee. He was due to go to trial on that charge on August 4, 2003, one month after Sandee's murder.[2]\nAshley Christine Humphrey (n\u00e9e Laney; born October 13, 1982)[3] was working at Planet Smoothie in Brandon, Florida when she met Tracey Humphrey at a local gym in 2002.[4] Ashley and Tracey married on July 4, 2003, one day before Sandee's murder.[4]\nOn July 5, 2003, Sandee Rozzo was shot to death in the garage of her Pinellas Park, Florida townhouse after returning home from her shift at the Green Iguana, a local bar.[2] Sandee's coworker Tracey Humphrey became the prime suspect.[5] Humphrey had an alibi however, claiming that he had ordered a pizza to his Brandon, Florida apartment at the time of the crime.[6] This was verified by an acquaintance, Tobe White. Further investigation however, revealed that his wife of one day, Ashley Humphrey, was not at home during the crime, as cell phone records indicated that Ashley was actually in Pinellas Park, Florida when Sandee was killed.[7] Ashley Humphrey was arrested for the first-degree murder of Sandra Rozzo and her husband Tracey Humphrey was charged with a federal firearms possession.[2] While she was in custody, Ashley Humphrey decided to cooperate with authorities. She had admitted that she shot Sandra Rozzo to death, but claimed it was at the behest of her husband. In her statement, she told vivid details about the plot to murder Sandee. In addition, she also gave up details regarding another failed murder attempt against Sandee. In a plea bargain, Ashley was allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for testimony against her husband. This gave prosecutors enough evidence to charge Tracey Humphrey with first-degree murder.[6]\nTracey Humphrey's murder trial began in February 2006. As part of her plea deal, Ashley testified against her husband. Under oath, she testified how she waited hours for Sandee to get off work at the Green Iguana, and then followed her back to her Pinellas Park home, where she fired eight shots into her.[7]  Tracey Humphrey testified in his own defense, stating that the killing was Ashley's idea.[8] The jury did not find him convincing. He was convicted of first-degree murder on February 25, 2006.[5] Even though he faced the death penalty, jurors opted for life without parole, believing that it would be a harsher punishment than death in this case.[9]\nTracey Humphrey is serving his sentence at South Bay Correctional Facility in South Bay, Florida, Inmate Number: 930490. Post-conviction, he was sentenced to an additional 15 years for a pre-trial escape attempt in April 2004.[1]\nOn March 10, 2006, Ashley Humphrey was sentenced to 25 years for murder.[9] She is currently incarcerated at the Gadsden Correctional Facility in Quincy, Florida, Inmate Number: 154362.

The jury pronounced him guilty and recommended the death penalty for Serrano in October 2006 after he was convicted of the murders. On June 26, 2007, Judge Susan Roberts sentenced him to death by lethal injection for each of these crimes. Serrano's conviction is controversial, and his culpability has been disputed.\nOn December 3, 1997, Frank Dosso, Diane Patisso, George Patisso, and George Gonsalves were found shot execution-style at the Erie Manufacturing plant in Bartow. Diane Patisso, a young state prosecutor, had gone to pick up her brother Frank and her husband George at the factory that evening, and prosecutors say she was murdered to prevent her from identifying the killer.\nDosso and Gonsalves accused Serrano of graft, then theft, but investigators, including the FBI, dismissed these accusations. Although there was no physical evidence at the scene to link Nelson Serrano to the crime, relatives of the victims immediately suspected Nelson Serrano, a former partner and CEO of the business. They had been in a bitter dispute with the others over his partners' removal of $1 million without his knowledge. However, millions of dollars were removed from corporate bank accounts after Serrano left the company, and only Dosso and Gonsalves had access to them. The money's whereabouts were never presented during the trial and remain unknown.\nDuring the summer of 1997, Nelson Serrano opened a separate business checking account with a different bank. He deposited two checks totaling over $200,000 from Erie's sister company Garment Conveyor Systems, as requested by corporate counsel to keep monies safe from Dosso and Gonsalves. There were disagreements about the distribution of assets and accusations by Serrano that there were two sets of books. Serrano instituted a civil suit against his partners. Ultimately, Serrano was removed as president by a vote of the other two partners, and Serrano left the companies. After that, the locks were changed on the building. Shortly before Serrano was ousted as CEO, Phil Dosso and George Gonsalves had fired Serrano\u2019s son, Francisco. Prosecutors said Serrano was angry because Gonsalves and Felice \"Phil\" Dosso, the third partner in the business, had ousted him and his son from both companies.\nNumerous Erie employees testified to the strained relations between Serrano and the other two partners, particularly Serrano\u2018s dislike of Gonsalves. Serrano made statements indicating that he wished Gonsalves were deceased. Another Erie employee testified that, weeks before the murders, a plant employee came to work with a gun and threatened to kill George. He was calmed down and sent home.\nAuthorities said both Serrano men had the motive to commit the murders, but Francisco Serrano provided an alibi. His father told authorities he was in an Atlanta hotel room with a migraine headache all day, so no one saw him or talked to him. But, almost three years later, law enforcement agents found his fingerprint on a parking garage receipt at Orlando International Airport dated 3:49\u00a0p.m. on Dec. 3, about two hours before the slayings occurred. Prosecutors felt that piece of evidence broke his alibi. However, the state's fingerprint expert stated the fingerprint was suspicious because of how it was found, because the print was from Serrano's right hand (a driver is more likely to take the ticket from the machine with his left hand) and because there were no other prints or smudges on the ticket.\nIn a court hearing in September 2013, Prosecutors admitted to withholding from defense counsel the testimony of the only eyewitness to the murder scene, John Purvis. Purvis stated that he witnessed an Asian young man (\"one of those slanty-eyed people\") between the ages of 25-30 outside of the main entrance to Erie and a young Latin man in the building looking out of the glass at or around the time investigators estimate the murders occurred. The victims were found in an office about 50 feet from the main entrance, suggesting that others were also involved. He also stated that a Lincoln or Cadillac was parked outside. The new attorneys for Serrano, headed by attorney Roy Black had also uncovered that prosecutors withheld from trial defense attorneys the fact that an extradition process had already begun one week before Serrano's illegal deportation and state attorney Paul Wallace traveled to Ecuador, misled government officials to seek deportation obstructing the federal process of extradition. Paul Wallace, as co-prosecutor during the trial, withheld this information from the court and jury. Nelson's defense has discovered that the Florida prosecutor and police concealed a third weapon used in the crime, a rifle for exclusive military use.\nSerrano claimed that he was on a business trip, 500 miles away in Atlanta, when the killings occurred. However, the prosecutors convinced the 12-member trial jury that Serrano had flown by airliner to Florida under assumed names to commit the premeditated murders. Then he had quickly flown back to Atlanta from a different major airport to attempt to establish an alibi by appearing on the security video cameras of his hotel.[2] Prosecutors stated that Serrano had tricked his nephew into providing him with a rental car (under a pseudonym) to reach the other airport. Although Bartow is midway between the major airports in Tampa and Orlando, evidence was not shown to prove this trip positively and that murders could be possible during rush hour traffic. Prosecutors and investigators did not find any videos from either airport showing Serrano.\nDuring the trial, Serrano's lawyers fought for a mistrial, claiming that Serrano was illegally deported from Ecuador to the United States. Serrano is an Ecuadorian citizen by birth and a naturalized American citizen (in 1971). In 1971, he renounced his Ecuadorian citizenship to obtain his United States citizenship. Serrano was kidnapped in Ecuador by Florida-hired off-duty police officers and then, according to the Ecuadorian government and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (a division of the Organization of American States), illegally deported back to Florida for his murder trial. Documents concerning this issue were presented during the trial and were confirmed by the Ecuadorian Ombudsman through his testimony. Judge Roberts, unaware that an extradition process was started and thwarted by state attorney Wallace, denied the defense motion, finding no cause to dismiss the case.\n",

At the time of the attacks, he was only 15 years old, with his victims ranging in ages between 52 and 80.

Little is known about his upbringing, but in October 1963, due to Florida's child marriage laws, he married a 15-year-old girl named Gwendolyn, whom he fathered one daughter with.[2]\nAt each crime scene, Washington left his fingerprints, usually on the windows he had climbed through. Due to this, he was arrested on January 3, 1964, and charged with the killings.[8] Not long after, he confessed, though claimed he was suffering from insanity.[9] In November, Washington pleaded guilty to the murders, and the following month was sentenced to serve three life sentences. In 1969, he was denied a retrial. In 1970, Washington attempted to appeal his convictions through a federal court. However, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied reviewing his case.[10]\nOn March 18, 2004, Washington died at age 55.[1]\n",

State and federal investigations were launched into the lynching but no one was ever indicted or convicted.[2] A decade earlier Claude Neal was lynched in Marianna.[3] The area was also wrought by a wave of violence against African Americans and Republicans during the Reconstruction Era after the American Civil War in what is known as the Jackson County War.\nHarrison, a farm worker, was convicted of killing gas station attendant Johnnie Mayo in 1940.[4] His conviction was overturned when his confession was thrown out on appeal.

The trip was planned to last for four months and began on July 2, 2021, but Petito disappeared in late August.\nAfter Petito's disappearance, Laundrie raised suspicion when he drove the van from Wyoming back to his parents' Florida home and refused to discuss her whereabouts. He was deemed a person of interest in the case and an arrest warrant was issued on charges of him making withdrawals using her debit card. He left his home on September 13 and was reported missing four days later.\nOn September 19, Petito's remains were found in Wyoming's Bridger\u2013Teton National Forest. An autopsy found that she was killed by manual strangulation. After a month of speculation around Laundrie's whereabouts, and an extended search of the area around his home, his skeletal remains were discovered in Florida's Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park on October 20. It was confirmed by an autopsy on November 23 that Laundrie had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, and the FBI later announced that he had admitted to killing Petito in his notebook, which was found near his remains.\nThe case gained widespread attention due to the couple's documenting of their travels on social media, leaked police body camera video footage, 9-1-1 emergency dispatch call recordings, eyewitness accounts, the actions of Laundrie's parents, and the extensive media coverage.\nGabrielle Venora Petito (March 19, 1999 \u2013 c. late August 2021) was born and raised in Blue Point, New York.[1] She had six younger siblings and half-siblings. In 2013, Petito and her step-brothers appeared in a music video to raise awareness about American gun violence in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[2][3] In 2017, she graduated from Bayport-Blue Point High School in Bayport, New York,[4] where she met Brian Christopher Laundrie.[5] From September 2017 to January 2019, she lived in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, working as a hostess and in the kitchen of a restaurant in nearby Wilmington. She applied to Cape Fear Community College, but did not attend.[6]\nPetito began dating Laundrie in March 2019,[7] and moved in with him and his parents in North Port, Florida. The couple worked at a Publix in North Port, where she was a pharmacy technician and he was in the grocery department. They quit their jobs at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.[5][8]\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, the couple embarked on a cross-country drive from New York to California. Along the way, they visited Las Vegas, Yosemite National Park, Pismo Beach, and other points of interest.[4] In March 2020, Petito celebrated her 21st birthday in Nokomis, Florida.[4] She and Laundrie visited Sope Creek, Georgia, in June 2020, and the two were engaged the following month.[9]\nIn December 2020, Petito purchased a 2012 Ford Transit Connect van converted into a camper, in which the couple would take their next cross-country trip.[10] To save money for the trip, she began working 50-hour weeks at Taco Bell[8] and as a nutritionist while Laundrie took a job at an organic juice bar.[11] Petito documented her life and travels on social media sites such as YouTube and Instagram, where she described her interests as \"art, yoga, and veggies\".[4][5]\n",

Emilia Lily Carr, a rival for the affections of a man Strong had dated, came under suspicion. Carr denied any guilt and alleged her statements were coerced. Carr was nevertheless found guilty in December 2010 and sentenced to death by lethal injection in February 2011. Carr was one of five women on death row in the state of Florida.[1] On May 19, 2017, Emilia Carr was re-sentenced to life without parole.[2] Joshua Fulgham (Heather Strong's husband, and Carr's co-accused) was similarly convicted of first-degree murder and kidnapping in the death.[3] At a separate trial, where he pled guilty, Joshua Fulgham received two consecutive sentences of life in prison for his involvement in Strong's murder.[4]\nEmilia Lily Carr was born Emilia Yera, on August 4, 1984. She was the second of three sisters.[5] A psychologist estimated her IQ to be 125.[6] At the age of 15, she reported abuse by her father to her school, but withdrew her statement to officials.[7] In February 2004, Carr's father was convicted of attempting to solicit the murders of his family (Emilia, her mother, and one of her sisters)[5] and was sentenced to four years in prison.\nCarr had been married twice and filed a restraining order against one of her ex-husbands for domestic violence. She was sentenced to two years of probation for her involvement in her ex-husband's grand theft of exotic birds.[5] Carr had three children at the time,[8] one of them with ex-boyfriend Jamie Acome.[5] At the time of the murder, she was eight months pregnant with a child presumed to be Joshua Fulgham's.[5]\nIn November 2008, Carr became engaged to Joshua Damien Fulgham, who instead married Heather Strong one month later. However, Carr maintained contact with them and babysat Strong's two children, according to Carr's family. In January 2009, Fulgham was arrested for threatening Strong with a shotgun, but was released after the charge of aggravated assault with a firearm was dropped. Investigators later discovered that Carr had threatened Strong with a knife to force her to withdraw her criminal complaint.[5] Carr and Fulgham re-established their relationship while Strong began seeing someone else.[9] Fulgham and Strong became involved in a legal battle over the custody of their two children.[10]\nIn February 2009, Heather Strong, then a 26-year-old resident of Citra, Florida, disappeared while employed at an Iron Skillet restaurant at a Petro gas station next to Interstate 75 in Reddick.[11] She was reported missing on February 15. Her remains were discovered on March 19,[9] in a shallow grave by a storage trailer in Boardman, near McIntosh, Florida. Carr was arrested on March 24, after investigators noted the frequency of her statements to authorities, ten in all without the presence of an attorney. Detectives also recorded undercover audio of Carr discussing details of the crime with Fulgham's sister. Carr, who at the time was seven months pregnant with Fulgham's child,[11] tricked Strong into the storage trailer behind the home of Carr's mother Maria and placed a plastic bag over her head after unsuccessfully trying to break her neck.[1] Strong eventually died of asphyxiation while bound by duct tape to a computer chair.[11][12]\nStrong's estranged husband Joshua Fulgham was arrested on suspicion of fraud for using her credit cards after she had disappeared.[9] Later in March 2009, Carr gave birth to her fourth child while in custody at Marion County Jail;[8] Her family gained custody of her older three children while her daughter by Fulgham has since been adopted. Carr provided a confession to investigators, but claimed that she had only done so in the hope of being reunited with her children.[13]\nEmilia Carr and Joshua Fulgham waived their right to a speedy trial during their arraignment for murder in April 2009. Prosecutor Rock Hooker immediately filed notice of his intent to pursue the death penalty because of the heinous nature of the crime.[9] In November 2009, State Circuit Judge Willard Pope declined Emilia Carr's request for a continuance of the trial because of her concerns over the preparedness of defense attorney Candace Hawthorne.[8] A jury found Carr guilty of first-degree murder and kidnapping after two and a half hours of deliberations on December 7, 2010.[11] During the penalty phase of the trial, Carr's family testified on her behalf that she had been traumatized since her early childhood by sexual abuse from her father and grandfather.[6] However, the jury voted 7-to-5 on December 10 in favor of the death penalty for Carr.[14][15] She was formally sentenced to death by lethal injection on February 22, 2011.[1]\nMore than a year after Carr's conviction for the murder of Heather Strong, her co-defendant Joshua Fulgham went on trial for his alleged participation in the murder in April 2012. Carr, on death row at the Lowell Correctional Institution Annex,[16] would not testify at the trial. The prosecution detailed the gruesome aspects of the crime. Both the prosecution and Fulgham's defense attorneys agreed that the motives for Heather Strong's murder were jealousy and betrayal.[17] At the conclusion of his trial, Fulgham was convicted of first-degree murder and kidnapping.[3] Despite the death sentence of his co-defendant, Joshua's jury voted 8-to-4 to sentence him to life in prison without a chance of parole[18] and the judge followed the jury's recommendation.[4]\nCarr was placed in the annex at Lowell Correctional Institution in Marion County on February 23, 2011. She was one of five women on death row in Florida, the other four being Tiffany Cole, Margaret Allen, Ana Maria Cardona and Tina Brown. Carr also became the first woman to be sentenced to death in Marion County since the 1992 sentencing of Aileen Wuornos. On May 19, 2017, Emilia Carr was re-sentenced to life without parole.[2]\n",

Once Doty's case went back to the trial court that sentenced him for post-conviction appeals, he initially asked the lower court to dismiss his attorney and waive all his appeals.[6] However, in 2016, the United States Supreme Court in Hurst v. Florida[7] declared Florida's capital sentencing laws unconstitutional. The old law called for a majority vote of the jury to sentence a defendant to death.[8] The new law calls for a unanimous jury vote of death in order to sentence a defendant to death. In 2016 Doty's first death sentence was thrown out. He was retried two years later, and the jury unanimously voted to sentence him to death again on May 15, 2018. Although Florida has yet to set Doty's execution date, Doty is the only inmate on Florida's death row who has chosen the electric chair over lethal injection as the preferred method of execution.[9]\nIn 2018, the Netflix program I Am a Killer featured Doty in the 10th episode.[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "John Milton (April 20, 1807 \u2013 April 1, 1865) was governor of Florida through most of the American Civil War. A lawyer who served in the Florida Legislature, he supported the secession of Florida from the Union and became governor in October 1861. In that post, he turned the state into a major supplier of food for the Confederacy. In his final message to the state legislature as the war was ending, he declared that death would be preferable to reunion with the North, and was found dead of gunshot soon after. He killed himself leaving his wife and numerous children including their toddler Jefferson Davis Milton behind.\nMilton was the son of a prominent Southern family and a relative of the famed English poet of the same name. A lawyer and politician, he was the governor of Florida through much of the Civil War, being a strong supporter of secession, as well as a slave owner.[1]\nHe was the son of Homer Virgil Milton (1781\u20131822), an officer who fought in the War of 1812,[2] and the grandson of Revolutionary War hero, United States presidential candidate of 1789, and former Georgia Secretary of State, John Milton (1756\u20131804).[3] Born near Louisville, Georgia, John Milton married Susan Cobb (\u2020 1842) in about 1830, and they had three children. John and Susan Milton lived in Georgia and later in Alabama. John got remarried to a Caroline Howze (1826-1901) from Alabama in 1844; they had two sons and seven daughters.[4]\nJohn and Caroline lived in Alabama, New Orleans,[5] and eventually settled in Marianna (northern Florida). One of his sons was Old West lawman Jeff Milton. One of John's grandsons, William Hall Milton (1864\u20131942), served as a United States senator from Florida (1908\u20131909).\nDuring his career, John became a lawyer, practicing in a number of communities in Georgia and Alabama, before settling in New Orleans. He came to Florida in 1846, and quickly entered the Florida political scene. In 1848, he served as a presidential elector for the state, then in 1850 was elected to the Florida House of Representatives.\nAs a supporter and enabler of slavery, he was an early advocate for secession of Florida from the Union. He was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention from Florida and in the same year ran for the office of governor.  A convention was called for to take up the issue of secession and on January 10, 1861, the measure passed.  He took the oath of office on October 7, 1861. During the Civil War, Milton stressed the importance of Florida as a supplier of goods, rather than men, with Florida being a large provider of food and salt for the Confederate Army. As the war drew to a close and the Confederacy was close to defeat, he became worn down by the stress of his office. Governor Milton left Tallahassee for his plantation, Sylvania, in Marianna, Florida.\nIn his final message to the state legislature, he said that the Northern Army leaders \"have developed a character so odious that death would be preferable to reunion with them.\"[6]\nOn April 1, 1865, he was found dead of a fatal gunshot wound to the head by his son, William Henry Milton. His death was reported as an accident by his family, church, and the West Florida News.[1] The New York Times assumed Governor Milton\u2019s death to be suicide at the prospect of Union victory and Republican government.[7] The president of the Florida Senate, Abraham K. Allison, was sworn in as governor of Florida later that day.\nGovernor John Milton is buried at Saint Luke's Episcopal Cemetery in Marianna. The late governor\u2019s remains lie in a Milton family section of the cemetery notable for the forty-three graves bearing the name, \u201cMilton\u201d (including the Milton maiden name).[8]\n",

        "paragraph": "Henry Lee Jones (born August 23, 1963) is an American criminal and serial killer who has been sentenced to death on multiple occasions for the murders of three people in Tennessee and Florida in August 2003. In addition to these crimes, he remains the prime suspect in a fourth killing dating back to 2002, and possibly other murders.\nHenry Lee Jones was born on August 23, 1963, in Cleveland, Mississippi. Little is known about his upbringing, but later on in life, Jones claimed that he grew up without a father and was regularly beaten with various objects by older relatives. At some point during his teens, he moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where he soon would delve into a life of crime and serve several prison sentences for minor offenses.\nOn October 3, 1981, the then-18-year-old Jones and a 19-year-old accomplice named Jackie Johnson went to the Johnny Harris Pontiac car dealership in Fort Lauderdale, where they planned to steal a car. After they were presented with several models by 45-year-old salesman Joseph Giovanni, they picked a tan 1976 Pontiac Grand Prix and asked to go on a test drive with it.[1] Jones drove the car while Giovanni sat next to him and Johnson sat in the back, and after some time, the pair held Giovanni at gunpoint. After finding a deserted area, all three got out of the car, whereupon Jones and Johnson robbed Giovanni and forced him into the trunk. They then picked up Jones' girlfriend, 17-year-old Annie Mae Robbins, and drove around for two hours until they found an orange grove, where they left Giovanni behind and sped away.[1]\nA few hours after this, the trio were pulled over by a highway patrol officer, but as the officer returned to his vehicle to check the license plate, Jones attempted to speed away. However, a short time afterwards, Jones turned towards a dirt road until they reached some train tracks, which blew out the car's tires and caused oil to leak. The trio then attempted to run away on foot, but were quickly surrounded by police - Robbins surrendered, while Jones and Johnson were caught along the I-95. Jones and Johnson were both charged, and after a brief and unsuccessful attempt to escape, Jones was found guilty and sentenced to a total of 35 years imprisonment for robbery, kidnapping and grand theft.[1]\nDuring his time in prison, Jones proved to be a violent and insubordinate inmate who was reprimanded a total of 36 times for offenses such as fighting and assaulting other inmates, weapons possession, disorderly conduct, etc. The most notable of these crimes was inciting a prison riot at the Liberty Correctional Institution in Bristol on January 23, 1991, for which he was given more prison  time.[1] Despite all of his infractions, he was released from the Tomoka Correctional Institution in Daytona Beach on July 1, 1997, due to prison overcrowding.[2]\nFrom the period of 1999 to 2001, Jones was repeatedly jailed for a variety of offenses ranging from stalking, drug possession and violating restraining orders, but either served short sentences or the charges were dropped.[1] On October 10, 2001, he was arrested and charged with assaulting his then-girlfriend and stealing a gray 1988 Ford Fiesta from a car dealership, but as the district attorney felt that they were lacking credible evidence, the charges of grand theft were dropped and Jones was allowed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges, for which he was given an 8-month prison sentence.[1]\nOn May 14, 2002, another girlfriend of Jones' reported him to Fort Lauderdale police for allegedly drugging and raping her mentally-handicapped teenage son. According to the statement, Jones and the victim had spent most of the day drinking, riding bikes and using Percodan together, until they eventually went to \"chill\" at the girlfriend's house.[1] After drinking and swallowing more Percodan, the victim was supposedly left near-incapacitated, which allowed Jones to drag him to the bedroom and continuously rape him for three hours. Six weeks after the initial report, the Assistant State Attorney for Broward County, Lauren Covitz, announced that she would not press charges due to the unlikely chance of a conviction. Because of this, Jones was never prosecuted for this supposed crime.[2]\nSometime in July 2002, Jones befriended 24-year-old Keith Gross, an employee at a local store named Kitchens to Go, and the pair would often smoke weed together. Presenting himself as \"Bam\", Jones was introduced to Gross' employer and friend, Ken Walker, who warned him to steer clear of his new \"friend\" because he had a bad feeling about him, which Gross ignored for the most part. On September 9, 2002, Walker had invited Gross to come over to his house so they could watch a game of football, but Gross failed to arrive. Walker became worried even further when he failed to arrive at work the following day, and after waiting for a few hours, he went to Gross' apartment on Sunrise Boulevard to check on him.[1]\nAfter peeking through the window, Walker saw Gross' naked, hogtied body on the floor of his apartment, with a T-shirt tied around his neck. Upon closer inspection, he also saw that his throat had been slit and that the killer had apparently wiped the murder weapon on Gross' butt cheek, judging by the smudges of blood left on it. Horrified by the discovery, Walker drove back to his store and phoned the police, who immediately went to the crime scene.[1] The subsequent investigation, led by Det. Mark Shotwell, started posting flyers around the city's gay bars as a way to seek information on Gross' death: this move was criticized by Walker and Gross' younger brother, Michael, who said that Keith was not gay and would never visit such an establishment. They instead directed the police's attention to Jones, but after questioning, authorities surmized that it was unlikely that he was the killer, as they believed Jones to be straight and, as a friend of Gross, would have no motive to commit such an act. Because of this, Jones was never arrested and the case went cold.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "Jack Roland Murphy (May 26, 1937[1] \u2013 September 12, 2020), known as \"Murph the Surf\" or \"Murf the Surf\", was convicted of murder in 1969. He was also involved in the biggest jewel heist in American history, the 1964 burglary of the jewel collection of New York's American Museum of Natural History. Murphy is also known for being a surfing champion, musician, author, and artist.\nHe was released from prison in 1986. He spent his latter years as an ordained minister, working with inmates in the field of prison ministry.[2]\n\nMurphy was born in Oceanside, California. He was an only child and his father worked as a telephone company lineman. As a child, Murphy enjoyed the violin and surfing. His family moved to Pittsburgh when he was in high school. According to Murphy, he played violin with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and won a tennis scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh.[3]\nIn 1955 he moved to Miami, Florida where he worked at hotels. He married Gloria Sostoc in 1957. They had two children together before divorcing in 1962. He remarried and opened a surf shop in Indialantic, Florida.[3]\nMurphy was involved in the notorious burglary, on October 29, 1964, at New York's American Museum of Natural History, of 24 precious gems, including the Star of India, the Eagle Diamond and the DeLong Star Ruby.[4] This heist was called the \"Jewel Heist of the Century.\" It targeted the museum's J.P. Morgan jewel collection.[5]\nMurphy had cased the museum earlier and discovered that security was lax to non-existent. The burglar alarm system was non-operational, and the hall's 19 exterior windows were left open two inches overnight for ventilation.[4] The thieves climbed in through the window and discovered that the display case alarms were non-functional as well. The stolen jewels were reported as being worth more than $400,000, though museum officials indicated the loss was actually incalculable.[5]\nMurphy and both his accomplices, Alan Kuhn and Roger Clark, were arrested two days later after police had been tipped off by staff members at the Cambridge House hotel where the three men had been staying and throwing lavish parties. The men were charged with first degree burglary and possession of burglary tools. Free on bail, the men returned to Florida. Months later, prosecutors charged Murphy and Kuhn with the unrelated robbery and assault of actress Eva Gabor. In response to the new charges, a judge raised their bail to $150,000 and the men were jailed. Kuhn offered to retrieve the jewels in exchange for a lighter sentence.[3]\nThe uninsured Star of India was recovered from a locker at a Miami bus station. Most of the other gems were also recovered, except the Eagle Diamond, which has since been hypothesized to have been cut down into smaller stones. Richard Duncan Pearson was also convicted.[6]\n",

His father was a wealthy businessman based in Cuba, and young Pawley attended private schools in both Havana and Santiago. He later returned to the United States, where he studied at the Gordon Military Academy in Georgia.\nIn 1927, Pawley began a connection with Curtiss-Wright that would make him an extremely wealthy man. In 1928, he returned to Cuba to become president of Nacional Cubana de Aviaci\u00f3n Curtiss, which was sold to Pan American Airlines in 1932. He then became president of Intercontinent Corporation in New York, evidently founded by Clement Keys, the former president of Curtiss. In 1933 he moved to China, where he became president of China National Aviation Corporation an airline running between Hong Kong and Shanghai.[1] Pawley finally sold out to Pan Am again.  He later assembled aircraft in partnership with the Chinese Nationalist government under the corporate name of Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company in Hangzhou, Wuhan, and finally Loiwing on the China-Burma border. (CAMCO was owned in partnership with the Chinese government, with the Pawley family interest represented by Intercontinent, which now served as a Pawley family holding company.)[2]\nIn 1940, Hindustan Aircraft Limited was set up in India with Pawley providing the initial organization.\nIn 1941, with his brothers Edward and Eugene, he was involved with the organization and support of the 1st American Volunteer Group, popularly known as the Flying Tigers.[3] The brothers established an assembly plant at Mingaladon airport outside Rangoon, Burma, where the AVG's Curtiss P-40 fighter aircraft were assembled, while an Intercontinent office in Rangoon (now Yangon) provided payroll and other housekeeping services to the group while it trained upcountry at Toungoo. Later, when Allied forces were driven out of lower Burma by the Japanese, the CAMCO factory and airfield across the border in Loiwing, China, served as a base for the AVG. When Loiwing in turn was captured by Japan in May 1942, Pawley moved his operation to India as a partner in Hindustan Aircraft Limited.[2]\nPawley was appointed as U.S. Ambassador by Harry Truman to Peru in 1945. He was named U.S. Ambassador to Brazil in 1948.[4]\nPostwar, Pawley was an active member of the Republican Party. A close friend of both President Dwight Eisenhower and Central Intelligence Agency director Allen W. Dulles, he took part in a policy that later become known as Executive Action, a plan to remove unfriendly foreign leaders from power. Pawley played a role in Operation PBSuccess, a CIA plot to overthrow the Guatemalan government of Jacobo Arbenz in 1954 after Arbenz introduced reforms affecting the United Fruit Company. Pawley is thought to have served in Peru, Brazil, Panama, Guatemala, Cuba and Nicaragua between 1945 and 1960.\nOn July 25, 1919, Pawley married Annie Hahr Dobbs of Marietta, Georgia.  In 1925, the couple moved to Miami and then to Havana, Cuba, in 1928. They returned with their three children to Miami, where their youngest child was born. The Pawleys then moved to Shanghai, China, with the baby, leaving their other children in Miami Beach with family. Mrs. Pawley lived in China until 1938 with periodic trips back to Miami. They were divorced in 1941.[2][5]\nHis final residence was in Miami Beach, Florida, where he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, in January 1977,[6] because he suffered from a severe case of the very painful disease - shingles.[2]\n",

Five people were killed while six others were injured in the shooting. About 36 people sustained injuries in the ensuing panic. Esteban Santiago-Ruiz, who flew in to the airport from Alaska and committed the shooting with a Walther PPS 9mm semi-automatic pistol, was taken into custody by a Broward County Sheriff's Office (BSO) deputy within 85 seconds after he started shooting. The shooting from start to finish lasted 70\u201380 seconds. Santiago was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and pleaded guilty to avoid possible execution. On August 17, 2018, Santiago was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences plus 120 years in prison.\nOn January 6, 2017, at 12:53\u00a0p.m. EST, the shooter, who had flown in from Alaska, opened fire with a Walther PPS 9mm semi-automatic pistol in the Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport. He opened fire in the baggage claim area of Terminal 2, which is the host terminal for Delta Air Lines and Air Canada.[1][2][3][4][5][6] He killed five people and injured six others.[7] The shooting lasted 70 to 80 seconds.[8] The shooter had purchased the gun legally, and legally checked it in his luggage.[7] After he stopped shooting, the suspect lay down on the floor.[9]\nA nearby Broward County Sheriff's Office (BSO) deputy immediately responded by running to the sound of gunfire, and apprehended the suspect within 85 seconds.[10] The deputy had been trained to react immediately to an active shooter, and said: \"I was basically going - reacting ... - what I was trained to do. So I went towards the shooting.\"[10] The following year, the BSO deputy was named Deputy of the Year by the Florida Sheriffs Association.[10] Other responding BSO officers also reacted in a manner that Special Master J. Dudley Goodlette, who later reviewed the incident, said was \"textbook.\"[10] Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said that law enforcement officers did not fire shots, and arrested the gunman without further incident.[6] The Special Master found that the shooting \"was not preventable by Sheriff Israel or anyone else\".[10]\nVideo showed travelers rushing out of the airport, and hundreds of people waiting on a ramp, as numerous law enforcement officers rushed to the scene.[6]  A brief panic occurred following \"unfounded reports of additional gunshots\". The false alarm touched off a brief panic in other terminals.[1] Former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer tweeted from the airport, \"Shots have been fired. Everyone is running.\"[1]\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop notice, closing the airport to all but emergency flights.[11] Port Everglades, staffed by the American Red Cross, assisted about 10,000 passengers who were bussed there for food, shelter, and to connect to transportation.[1] The airport remained closed for the remainder of the day, but reopened to commercial flights early the following day.[1] Following the shooting, more than 20,000 pieces of baggage were left at the airport amid the chaos.[8]\nPresident Obama was briefed about the shooting by Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco. President-elect Donald Trump tweeted that he was monitoring the situation and that he had spoken with Florida Governor Rick Scott regarding the shooting.[12] President Obama later consoled the victims and said that he had asked his staff to reach out to Mayor Jack Seiler in order to make sure efforts were coordinated between state and local officials.[13] Scott ordered flags of the United States and of Florida to be flown at half-mast throughout the state on January 7 and 8 to honor the victims.[14]\nAfter the shooting, Sheriff Israel called for a ban on assault rifles to be reinstated, and said that he didn\u2019t believe that people with mental illness should have access to firearms.[15] He said: \u201cAll I\u2019m going to do is speak my mind. If I\u2019m on an island, I\u2019m on an island. I\u2019m not going to worry about who is with me or who is not.\u201d[15]\nFive people died in the attack, all of whom were passing through Fort Lauderdale to begin cruises with their spouses.[16] The number of people injured due to the shooting was six, with three admitted to intensive care units.[17] The sheriff said that in addition to the people injured by gunshots, about 30 to 40 others were \"injured in the panic\" during the event.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "On May 26, 2012, Rudy Eugene attacked and maimed Ronald Poppo, a homeless man, on the MacArthur Causeway in Miami, Florida, making headlines worldwide. During the 18-minute filmed encounter, Eugene accused Poppo of stealing his Bible, beat him unconscious, removed Poppo's pants, and bit off most of Poppo's face above the beard (including his left eye), leaving him blind in both eyes.[1] As a result of the incident's shocking nature and subsequent worldwide media coverage, Eugene came to be dubbed the \"Miami Zombie\" and the \"Causeway Cannibal\".[2] The attack ended when Eugene was fatally shot by an officer of the Miami Police Department.\nAlthough friends and family filled in details of Eugene's life, the reason for the attack remains unclear. Eugene, 31, employed at a car wash at the time, was divorced with a series of petty criminal arrests from age 16, with the last in 2009. While police sources speculated that the use of a street drug like \"bath salts\" might have been a factor,[3] experts expressed doubt, since toxicology reports were only able to identify small amounts of marijuana in Eugene's system, leaving the ultimate cause of his behavior unknown.[4] Poppo, 65, a graduate of Manhattan's Stuyvesant High School, was homeless and had long been presumed dead by his estranged family.\nOn the morning of May 26, 2012, 31-year-old Rudy Eugene drove to Miami Beach, Florida, to Urban Beach Week.[5] After spending 30\u201340 minutes at the site, as filmed on security video in and around the car,[5] he abandoned it about noon, and began to cross the 3-mile-long (4.8\u00a0km) span of the MacArthur Causeway, stripping himself of his clothing and disposing of his driver's license as he advanced westward, according to eyewitnesses.[6] His vehicle was eventually discovered and towed by Miami Beach police. Inside the car, police discovered a Bible and five empty water bottles, which they believed had been recently consumed.[5]\nEugene - who eventually became completely naked, discarding even his shoes and his Bible at the crime scene[5] - encountered 65-year-old Ronald Poppo at approximately 1:55\u00a0pm. Poppo had been lying underneath the elevated Metromover people mover viaduct when Eugene began to pummel him, strip him of his pants, and bite his face. The attack unfolded at the west end of the MacArthur Causeway, near the headquarters of The Miami Herald in the Arts & Entertainment District neighborhood of Downtown Miami.[7] It was at first believed that neither Eugene nor Poppo[2] knew the other before their encounter, until a July 2012 publication revealed that Eugene had met Poppo while working for the homeless community of Miami.[8] A passing cyclist, Larry Vega, came upon the scene and alerted authorities via 9-1-1.[9] A few minutes later, Miami Police Department officer Jose Ramirez[10] arrived and, after doing a double take at the spectacle,[11] warned Eugene to desist from attacking Poppo. Eugene ignored the officer's warnings and, instead, reportedly growled at him, then resumed biting his victim.[9] The attack ended at 2:13\u00a0pm with Officer Ramirez shooting Eugene once at first, which proved ineffective, and then another four times. The ordeal was captured by a security camera on The Miami Herald building.[12] Surveillance video shows that the attack continued for 18 minutes before help arrived.[11]\nPoppo was admitted to Jackson Memorial Hospital in critical condition, with 75\u201380% of his face above the beard missing[9][11] and his left eye gouged out.[13] He underwent facial reconstruction surgeries that took months to complete, but he remained permanently disfigured and blind.[14] To help with the costs, a fund was set up and has collected $100,700 since July 17, 2012.[15] Poppo spoke to police, whom he thanked for saving his life, on July 19, explaining that Eugene, whom he hardly knew, approached him in a friendly manner but then, complaining he couldn't \"score\" at the beach and \"souped up on something\", started to talk about how they were going to die, accused Poppo of stealing his Bible, and, suddenly and without provocation, attacked and strangled him with wrestling holds, and then \"plucked out\" both his eyes.[16]\nPoppo lost his eyebrows, his nose, parts of his forehead and cheek, and his left eye, and was left totally blind due to the damage to his remaining right eye.[17] He underwent numerous surgeries to repair the damage to his face.  After rehabilitation, he put on 50 pounds (23\u00a0kg), and relearned how to dress, feed himself, shower, and shave.  He was granted permission to stay at the medical facility indefinitely.[18]\nAlthough the autopsy revealed no human flesh in Eugene's stomach, a number of undigested pills were discovered that have not been identified.[19]  Although police sources had speculated that the street drug \"bath salts\" might have been involved, preliminary toxicology reports were positive only for the presence of cannabis.[5][20] Authorities did not necessarily find the negative results conclusive; Broward County Sheriff Al Lamberti expressed a belief that some new drug not yet tested for played a role; nationally-noted toxicologist Barry Logan said Eugene's behavior was consistent with \"bath salts\" and that toxicologists \"are not testing for everything that may be out there\"; and the director of toxicology at the University of Florida, Dr. Bruce Goldberger, said, \"We are not incompetent... We have the tools, we have the sophistication and know-how. But the field is evolving so rapidly it is hard for us to keep track. It's almost as if it is a race we can never win\".[21]\nRudy Eugene (February 4, 1981[24]  \u2013 May 26, 2012)[25] was born at the Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida.[24] He was of Haitian descent through his immigrant parents, who divorced months after his birth. Eugene never made contact with his father, who died when he was six.[26] As a child he attended the Bethel Evangelical Baptist Church with his families on most Sundays.[26] Eugene attended North Miami Beach High School in the 10th and 11th grades,[27] and he played on its football team in the late 1990s.[28][29] At the age of 17, he transferred to North Miami High School.[30] After graduating, Eugene acquired money from such sources as selling CDs and jobs at McDonald's and in telemarketing. His last known employment was washing cars at a local automobile dealership.[31] Eugene had expressed interest in establishing his own mobile car wash business.[31][32]\nEugene's marriage, from 2005 to 2008, ended in divorce, with his wife reporting that there had been domestic violence in the relationship. The divorce was granted on January 8, 2008, and there were no children from their relationship.[33] Eugene was estranged from his ex-wife until his death.[34][35]\n",

Her murder remains unsolved.[2]\nLindsley was born to a wealthy family in Toledo, Ohio and was raised on the Isle of Pines, an island possession of Cuba in the Caribbean Sea. She spent 20 years in New York as a model, chorus line dancer and hostess on Bud Collyer's television game show Winner Take All.[3] She had dated Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., elder brother of President John F. Kennedy. There were rumors of an engagement between them, but Kennedy died while on active duty during World War II. She made an unsuccessful bid for state senator and had plans to run for a seat on the St. Johns County, Florida Commission.\nShe married a former mayor of St. Augustine, James \"Jinx\" Lindsley, a successful real estate agent, four months prior to her murder.[4][5] Despite being newly married, they resided in different homes; she lived at 124 Marine Street on the Matanzas River, while he alternatively used the historic Lindsley House at 214 St. George Street and another on Lew Boulevard on Anastasia Island.\nLindsley had been in an ongoing feud with Alan Griffin Stanford Jr., her neighbor at 126 Marine Street. One of the concerns was the six stray dogs she took in that barked incessantly. In a transcript of an October 1973 county meeting, one of the commissioners had remarked, \"I am aware you are a neighbor of the Stanfords and that y'all have had neighbor problems,\" to which Lindsley answered, \"That's true. (But) my life has been threatened. You mention personal things. He threatened my life.\"[1]\nBetween 5:30\u00a0p.m. and 6:00\u00a0p.m. on January 23, 1974, Lindsley was attacked on the front steps of her home at 124 Marine Street by a white middle-aged male wearing a white dress shirt and dark dress pants.[4] According to medical examiner Dr. Arthur Schwartz, who performed the autopsy, she was struck nine times with a machete on her hand, arm and in the head. One of her fingers was severed and she was nearly decapitated. The only thing missing from her house was a pet blue jay, whose cage was found smashed.[6]\nToward the end of the attack, an 18-year-old neighbor, Locke McCormick, heard the sounds of a commotion and went outside to look. He allegedly shouted to his mother that \"Mr. Stanford is hitting Mrs. Ponsell.\"[1] After the perpetrator left, the McCormicks went next door and saw Lindsley lying in a pool of blood on her porch and called the police.\nStanford was indicted, pled innocent[7] and was brought to trial; after two hours of jury deliberation, he was acquitted.[8] Critics accused the police of botching the investigation and tainting evidence.\nIn 1998 Bloody Sunset in St. Augustine, a work of fiction intermixed with facts from the case, was locally published by Jim Mast and Nancy Powell, friends of Lindsley. In 2000, the cable channel A&E aired an hour-long documentary on the case in its City Confidential series titled  St. Augustine: The Socialite and the Politician.[3][4]\n",

It was established in 1990 and is part of the Broward County Public Schools district. It is named after the writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas and is the only public high school in Parkland, serving almost all of the limits of that city as well as a section of Coral Springs.[3][4][5]\nOn February 14, 2018, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was the scene of a deadly mass shooting perpetrated by a 19-year-old former student of the school, that murdered 17 people and left 17 other people with injuries.[6]\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas High School was named after the Everglades environmentalist, Marjory Stoneman Douglas. The school is located just under two miles from the Everglades National Park, on part of the historical Everglades[7] for which Marjory Stoneman Douglas advocated. The school opened in 1990, the year of her centennial,[8] with students in grades 9 through 11, most of whom transferred from nearby schools Coral Springs High School and J. P. Taravella High School. The first senior class graduated in 1992.\nOn February 14, 2018, a mass shooting at the campus perpetrated by a 19-year-old former student of the school armed with a semi-automatic AR-15 style rifle, left 17 dead and 17 more wounded in less than six minutes.[9][10] The gunman was apprehended hours later.[11][6][12] Two years previously, a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School school resource Broward County Sheriff's Office deputy had an investigator for the Florida Department of Children and Families speak to Cruz, but his therapist said that he was \u201cnot currently a threat to himself or others\u201d and did not need to be committed. A mental health counselor said he did not meet the criteria under Florida law that allows the police to commit a mentally ill person against their will. Stoneman Douglas High School conducted a \u201cthreat assessment\u201d on Cruz after the counselor\u2019s report, and the Florida Department of Children and Families ultimately concluded that he  was not a threat because he was living with his mother, attending school, and seeing a counselor.[13][14]\nAuthorities charged the gunman with first-degree murder, and the case went to trial in September 2021 along with the case of an attack by the defendant against a jail officer.[15][16][17] On October 20, 2021, the gunman pleaded guilty to all charges, including murder and attempted murder.[18] On November 2, 2022, the gunman was sentenced to 34 consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, one life sentence for each of the victims murdered and wounded by the gunman.[19]\nStudents from Stoneman Douglas were instrumental in helping organize nationwide student protests following the shooting, and in spurring the revision of Florida law, on March 4, 2018, to raise the legal rifle-owner age from 18 to 21, with a three-day wait.[20][21][22]\nThe Marjory Stoneman Douglas Athletics Department operates programs in football, volleyball, lacrosse, softball, tennis, track, water polo, bowling, basketball, cheerleading, soccer, wrestling, swimming, cross country, and golf.[23]\nThe cheerleading squad at the school received international attention in 2012 when its coach[24] was fired in response to complaints from parents. Parents complained about being charged thousands of dollars for their children to participate in the program, and alleged that the coach mishandled the team's finances and encouraged bullying.[25]\n",

An organized protest in the form of a national school walkout occurred on March 14. March for Our Lives was held on March 24. Another major demonstration occurred April 20, 2018.\nThe anti-gun violence group Never Again MSD, formed and led by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting,[1] held a rally on February 17 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which was attended by hundreds of students.[2]\nThe Fort Lauderdale rally was followed by other protests across the country. On February 19, a group of teenagers staged a \"lie-in\" outside the White House.[3] Hundreds of students marched to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 20.[4] Students also demonstrated at Florida's Capitol.[5] In Kansas, several hundred high school students protested on February 21.[6]\nThe students from Parkland, Florida began encouraging companies who partner with the NRA \u2014 offering perks or discounts to members \u2014 to sever ties with the organization. Over a dozen[7] companies dropped their NRA partnership in the days following.[8]\nThe Enough! National School Walkout[11] was a walkout planned by organizers of the Students' March, that occurred on March 14, in response to the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. The protest had students, parents, and gun control students leaving schools for seventeen minutes (one minute for each person who died during the shooting) starting at 10:00\u00a0a.m. in their respective time zone.[12][13] The protest was held exactly one month after the Stoneman Douglas shooting.[14][15] The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) supported the student's activism.[16]\nAn estimated 3,000 schools and nearly 1 million students participated in the protest.[17][18][19][20] Thousands of students gathered in Washington, D.C. and observed 17 minutes of silence with their backs turned to the White House.[21]\nAt Greenbrier High School in Greenbrier, Arkansas three students elected to receive corporal punishment in the form of two paddlings on the thighs for their participation in the walkout. This required parental consent, and was administered the same day.[22]\n[23]\nNearly 200 U.S. colleges added their names to #NeverAgain Colleges,[24] including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University, and the University of Florida.[25] The colleges would not penalize high school students who face disciplinary action as a result of participating in a peaceful Never Again MSD protest.[25]\n",

He was found shot and beaten to death in his apartment in 1996, along with his longtime friend, Timwanika Lumpkins.[2] Barnes was a six-foot, 220-pound linebacker who played second string for the Hurricanes.  Barnes and former Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis were roommates at the University of Miami.\nOn the morning of April 13, 1996, Barnes' body was discovered when his roommate Earl Little came home to pick up the keys to his truck. Little found that someone had slashed two of the tires on his truck, and when he attempted to open the door to the apartment, he noticed that there was something obstructing the door. When Earl looked through an opening in the door, he saw the Barnes' body slumped against the door with a pool of blood surrounding him. Barnes was severely injured and had nearly lost his entire face in what appeared to be a brutal beating, and was close to death when Little found him. By the time the police arrived, Barnes was already dead. It was discovered that Barnes had been beaten to death with a blunt object. After a thorough search of the rest of the apartment, police found the beaten and broken, yet alive, body of Barnes\u2019 girlfriend, Timwanika Lumpkins, pinned between the bed and the wall. She later died in the hospital.[3][4]\nAfter seventeen days of investigation, it was concluded that Lumpkins\u2019 ex-boyfriend,  Labrant Dennis, had entered the apartment after slashing the tires on Little's car. After entering the apartment, Dennis proceeded to beat Barnes twenty-two times with the butt of a shotgun. When he was done with Barnes, he turned on Lumpkins, doing the same to her as he did to Barnes.[3] Dennis was sentenced to the death penalty[5] and, as of 2018[update], was still on death row.[6]\nIn December 1996, the University of Miami agreed to a financial settlement with the families of Barnes and Lumpkins due to the murders having occurred in an on-campus apartment.  All parties agreed to maintain the confidentiality of the settlement terms. But the Miami Herald reported that each family received more than $1 million.[7][8]\nIn 2003 the popular Discovery Channel documentary series The New Detectives covered the case in the episode named \"Crimes of Passion\" (S08E10) with the similar murder case of Ralph Gawor from Fresno, California.\nThe Investigation Discovery documentary series The Perfect Murder, in an episode titled \"The Last Blitz\"' (S5; E10), air date: September 27, 2018, run time: 42 minutes, depicts the Barnes-Lumpkins murders and the shock waves experienced by the University of Miami campus and community.[9][10]\n\n",

        "paragraph": "Dontae Rashawn Morris (born August 24, 1985)[1] is an American murderer who shot and killed five people in Tampa between May and June 2010. He was initially sentenced to three death sentences in two cases (10-CF-10203A in 2014 & 10-CF-10373A in 2015). After a 2016 change in Florida law requiring a jury to recommend death unanimously, Morris appealed all of his death penalty verdicts. In case 2010-CF-10203A, the murder of Tampa Police officers David Curtis and Jeffrey Kocab, the jury had returned a unanimous verdict recommending death. As such, in 2021, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed his sentence of death in that case.[2] In 2010-CF-10373, the murder of Derek Anderson, death was recommended by a majority, rather than unanimously. In 2021, Morris appealed and instead of retrying the case, State Attorney Andrew Warren elected to agree to re-sentencing Morris to life in prison on that case.[3] Morris is also sentence to life in prison for the murder of Rodney Jones.[4]\nDontae Morris was born the son of a 16-year-old who suffered from depression. His father was murdered when he was two years old, and the crime remains unsolved. He grew up partially with his sick grandmother and changed schools several times. From a new relationship his mother engaged in, two step-siblings were born. Dontae Morris is said to be a member of the \"Bloods\" street gang according to prison records,[5] and he had a 7-year-old son in 2013.\nHis aunt, Carolyn Riggins, worked at the Tampa Police Department and was released in July 2010, as the authorities discovered that she withheld important information that could have led to Morris being arrested earlier.\nHis girlfriend, Cortnee Brantley, who had driven the car on the night of the June 29 murder, was sentenced to a one year prison sentence for fleeing from a crime scene and concealing a dangerous weapon.\nBetween May 18 and June 8, 2010, Morris shot and killed 21-year-old Derek Anderson, 42-year-old Rodney Jones and 25-year-old Harold Wright. According to the investigation, the reason was due to drug trades.[6] The crime scenes were located in the Kenneth Court Apartments, the Cotton Club Bar and Palm River-Clair Mel, all located in Tampa.\nOn June 29, 2010, Morris shot and killed police officers Jeffrey Kocab and David Curtis as they attempted to arrest him in East Tampa. Morris was a passenger in his girlfriend's vehicle when they were stopped on the corner of Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd and 50th Street for missing license plates. As there was an arrest warrant for Morris from Jacksonville for check fraud, Curtis requested assistance from his partner Kocab. When they asked him to put his hands behind his back, Morris shot both officers in the head with a pistol and then fled on foot.[7]\nA witness alerted the police, who started a search for the culprit with a large contingent. The murders of the two officers had been recorded by the dashcam of David Curtis' patrol car, which helped identify Dontae Morris as the perpetrator. His girlfriend, who had fled the car and hid in an apartment, was also identified from the dashcam video. It was the most deadly day of the Tampa Police Department in over twelve years since May 19, 1998, when detectives Ricky Childers and Randy Bell were shot dead by Hank Earl Carr.[8]\nIn the following days, the search for Morris became the biggest manhunt in Tampa's history. More than 1,000 officers and employees from 22 agencies were involved in the search, including FBI and ATF officials, SWAT teams, armored vehicles, dog teams and helicopters with thermal imagers. In addition, about 300 homes were searched and a media-assisted search was launched, with hundreds of wanted posters installed in Florida and two other states. The reward for clues leading to his arrest was increased to $101,000.\nThe authorities announced that Morris' criminal record was 14 pages long and he had twice been in jail.[9] Offenses included disturbances on the street, car theft, drug possession, drug trafficking, violation of the weapons law, resistance to arrest, assault, violation of probation, attempted robbery and dangerous bodily harm. He was also charged with murder, but acquitted. At press conferences, the police also announced that Morris was suspected of two more murders of African-American residents of Tampa.[10]\n",

Being made available for digital consumption as the record's third single on 6 September 2016 through Monkey Puzzle and RCA Records, \"The Greatest\" features a new part with the American rapper Kendrick Lamar. The electropop song was written by Sia, Greg Kurstin, and Lamar while production was only handled by Kurstin. The solo version was written only by the former two. The song was originally intended to be in a new album called We Are Your Children.[1]\nAn accompanying music video for the single was filmed by Sia and Daniel Askill, and features American dancer Maddie Ziegler surrounded by 48 different young people.[2] Although the singer has not provided an interpretation of the video's plot, numerous media outlets have perceived it as a tribute to the 49 victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting.[3] Commercially, \"The Greatest\" reached the top five in several countries and was awarded with certifications in different territories.  The music video was nominated for a 2017 MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography.[4]\nBillboard editor Gil Kaufman described \"The Greatest\" as an \"uplifting, poppy song with a subtle island vibe.\"[5]\nThe song is written in the key of C minor with a cut common time tempo of 96 beats per minute. The vocals span from B\u266d3 to E\u266d5 in the song.[6]\nThe Greatest was highly praised by music critics and its commemoration too. Jessica Goodman from Entertainment Weekly explained the chorus \"massive and catchy.\"[7] Once the critics had picked up on the song's connection with the Orlando nightclub shooting, Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic wrote:\nMaking pop about a specific tragedy is necessarily a tricky job. So it's no crime that some of the other mainstream original songs memorializing Orlando have been as rote as issue-oriented singles are often stereotyped as being. ... But \"The Greatest\" is very potent, a work of art, not charity. ... There's no break here from the rest of Sia's catalog about pain and release in everyday life: You hear a sad voice wailing about bucking up, very stark emotional peaks and valleys, and a danceable backing of explosive drums, toy-box melodies, and reggae grooves. Sia and Greg Kurstin may have written the song even before the massacre. But in the context of Orlando, the possible platitude of the chorus becomes gutting: \"I'm free to be the greatest / I'm alive.\" She's pepping the listener up, but she's also defining the value of life, marking the human potential that's been lost.[8]The Orlando shooting commemoration was also praised by Bruno Russell from The Edge, who called the song's concept \"inspirational\" as \"the message is clear: that we can make a difference and be 'The Greatest,' but we have to act now.\" Russell awarded a 5-star review for the song, praising her performance as having \"somewhat of a narrative feel, especially from the childish nature of the instrumental backing, which emphasizes the vulnerability there to be exposed and challenged (though, at the same time, there is also a power within this from the more powerful chorus).\" Russell also praised Lamar's rap in the single release of the track.[9]\nUpon the song's release, \"The Greatest\" debuted on several charts worldwide, including the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 52, UK Singles Chart at 49, and Australian Singles Chart at number 25, and achieved top ten debuts in France,[10] New Zealand,[11] Scotland, Finland, Norway,[12] Hungary, Spain, and Sweden.[13] In its second week on UK Singles Chart, the song climbed to number 5, making it Sia's ninth top ten single on that chart, and Kendrick's second.[14][15] It later rose to number 2 in Australia,[16] number 1 in Switzerland,[17] and number 18 in the US.[18]\nIn its fourth week on the singles chart, \"The Greatest\" was certified Gold in both Australia and Canada.[19]\n",

Byrd Billings, 66, and his wife, Melanie, 43, were found shot to death on July 9, 2009.[1] The suspects, dressed in \"ninja garb,\"[2] stole a safe and other items during the break-in at the sprawling Billings home west of Pensacola. Nine of their children were home at the time, but were not hurt by the intruders.[1] The family's attorney said that the safe contained jewelry, family papers, and prescription medications.[3]\nByrd Starling Billings divorced his second wife Cynthia Reeve Billings in January 1993.[4] Four months later, he married his third wife, Melanie Anne Billings (n\u00e9e Brock).[4][5] Melanie Billings had two biological children from previous relationships, Ashley Markham[6][7] and Nicole \"Nikki\" Billings (died in 2008).[6][8][9] Melanie was 17 years old when she gave birth to Ashley and 19 years old when she gave birth to Nikki.[7]\nByrd Billings reportedly had two biological children also (not with Melanie Billings).[10]\nThey had a total of 16 children, including each other's stepchildren and adoptive children.[11][12][nb 1] One source said 13 of the children were adopted.[15] Before the couple's murder, three of their adopted children, many of whom had special needs, had died.[10]\nAt the time of their death, Melanie Billings owned a used car lot and Byrd Billings had a company named Worldco Financial Services.[5][16] Byrd Billings was also a used car dealer and former strip club owner.[5][17]\nSeven men were charged with first-degree murder and home invasion robbery, and an eighth suspect was charged with being an accessory after the fact.[13]\nIn October 2010, Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr. was on trial for first-degree murder facing a possible death sentence in Escambia County Circuit Court in Pensacola.[18] The Billings had 16 cameras located around the residence to help them observe their children, and some of the video footage was shown in court.[18] Gonzalez was identified in one video by Frederick Thornton, one of his accomplices, as the person who shot Byrd Billings.[18]\nOn February 17, 2011, it was announced that Gonzalez was to be sentenced to death for the first-degree murders. On April 10, 2014, Gonzalez's conviction and sentence of death were affirmed on direct appeal by the Florida Supreme Court.[19]\nA total of eight people were convicted for planning and participating in the crimes.

        "paragraph": "Jerry White (February 12, 1948 \u2013 December 4, 1995) was executed by electric chair by the state of Florida in 1995 for the murder of James Melson, a shopper in a grocery that White robbed in Orange County in 1981. White's execution was noteworthy due to witnesses reporting that White had an unusual reaction to the electricity. Later two separate death row inmates, Phillip Atkins and Thomas Harrison Provenzano, would attempt to use White's execution as evidence that Florida's electric chair was malfunctioning and subjected death row inmates to cruel and unusual punishment.\nJerry White was born on February 12, 1948,[1] in Quincy, Florida. White grew up in an environment of poverty and instability. He never met his biological father, and his stepfather, a sharecropper, was murdered when White was a child.[2] White's mother, Mabel Pinkins, worked as a maid and was rarely home during White's childhood. White began drinking alcohol when he was a teenager. When he was 14, he was arrested for the first time for burglary. He was sentenced to serve one year in a reform school in Marianna, Florida, where he reported being beaten. Following his release, White's mother noted that his personality suddenly changed and that he seemed \"quiet and withdrawn for a long, long time.\"[3] He began drinking alcohol when he was 15. White subsequently dropped out of school and developed an addiction to heroin.[2]\nPrior to the crime for which he was executed, White accumulated a long history of arrests for crimes including attempted murder, robbery, larceny, and burglary. In 1977, White was convicted of three counts of robbery and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was released from prison in March 1980, a year prior to the robbery of the Alexander Grocery Store.[4] Overall, prior to 1981, White had accumulated nine felony convictions.[5]\nAlso prior to the murder, White was engaged to marry a woman named Pauline Forster.[3]\nAt 11:30 a.m. March 8, 1981, Jerry White entered Alexander's Grocery Store in Taft, Florida, with the intent to rob the store. At the time, Alex Alexander, the store's 53-year-old owner, and James A. Melson, a 34-year-old customer, were the only people in the store. White led Alexander and Melson to a bathroom at the back of the store and then shot them both with a pistol. White shot Melson twice, once in his arm and once in his head, while Alexander was shot in the spine.[6] After White shot Alexander and Melson, two unsuspecting customers, a man and his 12-year-old daughter, entered the store. White attempted to force the customers into a freezer and, when they refused, then attempted to shoot them both at point-blank range. However, the gun misfired. Afterwards, White departed the store on foot, while the man and his daughter left the store in their car and reported the shootings to a nearby police officer.[7][8] During the robbery, White robbed the store of $388.[9]\nOrange County deputy sheriffs found Jerry White lying on his side in a wooded area with cash in his pockets less than an hour after the shootings.[7][8] When White was apprehended, police discovered that he had sustained gunshot wounds in the groin and left thigh. Police denied that he was shot during his arrest and stated that he accidentally shot himself while attempting to tuck his pistol back into his pants while he was still in the store.[4][9]\nParamedics transported Melson and Alexander to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, where Melson was pronounced dead. Alexander remained in critical condition for days, being kept alive with a respirator. Ultimately, his spinal cord injuries caused him to be paralyzed from the neck down and unable to speak for the rest of his life.[4] Alexander remained in a Veterans Administration hospital in that condition until he died approximately four years later, in October 1985, of heart failure and other complications related to the injuries he sustained in the shooting.[9][10][11]\nJerry White's trial began on April 21, 1982. White, who was African American, had an all-white jury after all prospective black jurors were removed from the jury pool.[3] Witnesses included the unsuspecting customers White had attempted to shoot. On the stand, both positively identified White as the man who had attempted to shoot them and stated that they saw him with cash in his pockets.[8]\nWhite testified at trial that he had requested that Alexander make change for $500, and that Alexander cheated him out of some money during the exchange. According to White, an argument ensued, during which he revealed a pistol to intimidate Alexander. He and Alexander fought over the gun in White's possession; White ultimately claimed that Melson and Alexander's shootings were accidental and that he had sustained the gunshot wounds to his groin and leg during the same struggle.[5] Forensic evidence showed that Melson and Alexander were both shot execution-style, at point-blank range from behind.[12]\n",

In mid-1975, after several reprobations of child abuse (among those the molestation of a boy of 9 years and one of 11 years), Goode was sentenced to five years of probation under the condition of psychological treatment at Spring Grove Hospital Center in Baltimore. Goode admitted himself to the treatment for several days but then left the institution and journeyed to Cape Coral, Florida, where his parents had moved.\nOn March 5, 1976, Goode committed the murder for which he was to be executed. In Cape Coral, he happened upon 9-year-old Jason VerDow, lured him into the woods, abused and then strangled him. Afterwards, he traveled back to Baltimore, where he abducted 10-year-old Billy Arthes and took him to Washington, D.C. There he met 11-year-old Kenneth Dawson and took both boys with him on a bus trip to Falls Church, Virginia, where he murdered Dawson with Arthes being present. Goode was apprehended by the police after a woman recognized Billy Arthes (who had since been reported as kidnapped but was physically unharmed on Goode's arrest). On being arrested, Goode told the officers: \"You can't do nothing to me. I'm sick.\"\nA jury in Maryland found him sane and guilty of murder and gave him a life sentence. Hereafter, he also received a trial in Florida for the murder of Jason VerDow. He was permitted to conduct his own defense and was sentenced to death on March 21, 1977.\nGoode's father described him as, \"crazier than hell and dumber than a box of rocks.\"[3]\nOne month before his death, Goode was interviewed by John Waters for the Baltimore City Paper.[4] Goode admitted to being a pedophile and to slaying the two boys, but saw his actions as some kind of \"protest against society\".[5] He also said that if pedophiles were punished less strictly, they wouldn't need to hide by murdering their victims.[6]\nGoode was said to be one of the most hated men on Florida's death row. He wrote countless letters to school teachers, seeking children for pen pals, and also to the parents of the boys he murdered, boasting of  his crimes. He had a fixation with the child actor Ricky Schroder, and during an interview on the eve of his execution, he was asked if he had any last request. With a smile, he answered, \"Yes, I want Ricky Schroder to sit on my lap when I am strapped into the electric chair.\" During the interview, he joked with reporters and had no remorse for the killing of the young boy.\nFor his last meal, Goode had steak, corn, broccoli and cookies. He also reportedly requested to have intercourse with a little boy for the last time.[6]\nArthur Goode was killed by electrocution on April 5, 1984. His last words were, \"I have remorse for the two boys I murdered. But it's hard for me to show it.\"\nYears later when asked to reflect on his involvement in executions, Warden Richard Dugger said, \"Arthur Goode was the hardest. I had some real reservations about that one. Let's face it - he was a nut.\"[7]\n",

Every night has something different in store, but Pulse is known to have some pretty impressive drag shows, and the bar's dancers are usually gorgeous.\"[2] Because of the three areas, Lonely Planet Discover Florida deemed it \"three nightclubs,\"[3] while their Florida volume focused on it being \"ultramodern.\"[4]\nTop 10 Orlando called it a \"firm favorite for the Orlando gay crowd,\"[5] The Rough Guide to Florida deemed it \"justifiably popular,\" citing its \"great lighting and sound plus cabaret performers, drag acts, and erotic dancers.\"[6] Pulse was the only gay club mentioned in The Rough Guide to the USA for Orlando.[7] According to listings, the entire premises, including the washrooms, were accessible.[8] Using \"periodic consumer surveys,\" Zagat rated Pulse 25/30 for atmosphere, 25/30 decor, and 22/30 service.[9]\nIn 1985\u2014prior to Pulse's founding\u2014the property located at 1912 South Orange Avenue was home to a pizza restaurant named Lorenzo's.[10] By 1999, it was called Dante's, a bar with live music.[11] Dante's closed in January 2003.[12]\nFounded by Barbara Poma and Ron Legler, Pulse opened on July 2, 2004.[13][1][14] Poma's brother, John, died in 1991 from AIDS, and the club is \"named for John's pulse to live on,\" according to a marketing staff member in February 2016.[15][16] The venue had a focus on local talent.[16] Poma ensured that her brother's memory was prominent on the website, and that the facility was more than \"just another gay club.\"[15] Legler, who was president of the Florida Theatrical Association when Pulse was founded, also founded two nightclubs in Lake Eola Park in 2010, before moving to Baltimore in 2014.[17] The Washington Post described the club's first 12 years as \"a community hub for HIV prevention, breast-cancer awareness and immigrant rights,\" and reported it had partnered with educational and advocacy groups such as Come Out with Pride, Equality Florida, and the Zebra Coalition.[15]\nOn June 12, 2016, a 29-year-old Muslim extremist named Omar Mateen, killed 49 people and wounded 58 others in a mass shooting. Manteen affirmed he was acting on behalf of the terrorist group ISIS, and swore allegiance to the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.[18][19] The attack was the deadliest single gunman mass shooting in United States history until the 2017 Las Vegas shooting,[20][21][22][23][24] the deadliest incident of violence against LGBT people in U.S. history,[25] and the second deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil since the September 11 attacks of 2001.[26][27][28]\nIn November 2016, the city of Orlando agreed to buy the nightclub for $2.25\u00a0million.

After playing rhythm guitar in the Oaks Band, Sanders was asked to replace William Lee Golden, the baritone in The Oak Ridge Boys, who had left the group in 1987.\nSanders began singing gospel music at the age of 5. By the age of 6, he was the sole support for his family.  His father played piano, and \"Little Stevie\" would sing, mostly at church appearances.  Although he lacked formal education \u2014 Sanders did not graduate from high school\u2014he was a natural on stage.  \nIn addition to appearing on Broadway in The Yearling at the age of 12, he was recruited by Otto Preminger in 1967 for the film Hurry Sundown with Faye Dunaway and Jane Fonda.  He also made appearances on Gunsmoke.  The Oak Ridge Boys, who were also a gospel act at the time, used to open for Little Stevie Sanders.  \nUpon turning 18, he learned his father had squandered all of his money. Disillusioned and broke, Sanders headed to London, began a band called Pyramid, and was known to jam with the local scene, including Mylon Lefever and 10 Years After.[citation needed]  Years later, upon his return to the United States, Sanders provided vocals for several projects at studios such as Bang Records and Muscle Shoals.\nSanders made his debut with The Oak Ridge Boys band in 1981 as a rhythm guitarist. When William Lee Golden left, he moved to the front and sang baritone with the group from 1987 to 1995.  In that position, Sanders kept the Oak Ridge Boys on the charts by providing the blue-eyed soul on the classics - \"Gonna Take Alot of River\", \"No Matter How High\", \"Beyond Those Years\" and \"Bridges and Walls\", the last number-one single they had was with Steve Sanders.[1]\nBorn in Richland, Georgia, on September 17, 1952, to Herbert and Lorraine Sanders, he was the oldest of four children (siblings David and Debra, and stepbrother Noah from Herbert's second marriage).  He did not have a typical upbringing.  His father said before his passing, \"I heard his voice from downstairs singing with the piano, and thought, there is my retirement plan.\"\nSanders met his first wife Mary Milbourn at Bang Records; they had two children, Gaylea and Sevren. Twelve years after his divorce from Milbourn, he married Janet Riggins.  The two had met backstage at Bally's in Las Vegas, where the Oak Ridge Boys were performing, and Riggins was a dancer.  They married at the Tennessee Governor's Mansion after an 18-month courtship.\nImmediately after Sanders's marriage, his ex-wife began a barrage of harassment and litigation, ultimately draining him financially and causing him to leave the group. Eight hours after Sanders took his life, sheriff's officers showed up with the most recent and final set of papers filed by Milbourn.\nYears later, the Oak Ridge Boys were inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame, though Sanders is not included on the plaque.\nSanders died in 1998 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.[2]\n",

Gore was convicted, sentenced to death, and subsequently executed in 2013 at Florida State Prison by lethal injection.[3]\nGore was born on August 17, 1963, in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in a troubled family. He was the second of five children born to Jimmy Joe Gore and Brenda McCurry Gore. His parents married in Chicago in 1961, where Gore grew up. They later moved to the Miami area. The Gore family frequently got into trouble with the law. Jimmy Joe Gore was arrested on felony charges in three states. Some of Gore's siblings were also arrested for various offenses. Gore was arrested at least eight times for multiple offenses throughout the 1980s in Miami-Dade County, Florida. His parents' marriage fell apart in 1985 due to abuse and violence, with the couple officially getting a divorce in 1987. Gore stayed with his father in Florida and worked as a bouncer at a bar his father owned.[4]\nOn January 30, 1988, 19-year-old Susan Marie Roark, a Tennessee college student, disappeared. She was last seen alive with Gore leaving a trailer park in Bradley County, Tennessee. Roark phoned her grandmother and told her she was spending the night with a girlfriend in Cleveland. She said she would be home the following morning in time for church. The following day, Gore murdered her, inflicting trauma to her neck and chest. He then stole her car, a 1986 black Ford Mustang, and dumped her body off a forest road in Columbia County, Florida.[5] On February 14, he attacked a Miami waitress, raping and stabbing her. The waitress survived the attack, and Gore abandoned the stolen Mustang in Miami, where it was found the same day.[6]\nOn March 11, 30-year-old Robyn Gayle Novick, a General Motors credit services representative from Lauderhill, who was working a brief stint moonlighting as a dancer, was seen leaving the parking lot of a tavern in her yellow Corvette.[7] She was spotted leaving with a man, who was later identified as Gore. Gore murdered Novick by stabbing her in the chest and tying a belt around her neck. He stole her car and dumped her body in a trash heap near Homestead. According to a medical examiner, the cause of death was mechanical asphyxia and stab wounds. The time of death was estimated between 9\u00a0p.m. and 1\u00a0a.m. from the late hours of March 11 to the early hours of March 12. In the early hours of March 12, Gore was spotted driving Novick's car. He abandoned the car hours later in Coral Gables, where police found it.[5][6]\nOn March 14, Gore attacked a third woman. He abducted 32-year-old Tina Coralis, a nude dancer from Broward.[8] He beat Coralis with a rock, raped her, choked her, stabbed her, then slit her throat with a knife. He left her for dead by the side of a road near to where he had dumped Novick's body.[9] Gore then stole her car and drove off, abducting her 2-year-old son Jimmy, who was still sitting in the back of the vehicle.[5][6]\nCoralis survived the attack and alerted the police. After attacking Coralis, Gore fled the state and headed to Georgia, where he left Jimmy, locking him in the pantry of an abandoned barn before heading north towards Kentucky. On March 16, while police were searching for Jimmy, they came across the body of Novick, who was found near to where Gore had left Coralis. On March 16, Jimmy was found unharmed.[10]\nGore was tracked to a trailer in Paducah, Kentucky. He was captured on March 17, unarmed and without incident. Near to the trailer, police found the stolen car that belonged to Coralis. After he was arrested, Gore was questioned about all three crimes. He initially denied knowing any of the women and tried claiming that he was the biological father of Jimmy. Police showed him photos of Novick's body, which caused his eyes to fill with tears. He then reportedly said, \"If I did this, I deserve the death penalty.\"[10]\nIn April 1988, Columbia County deputies found Roark's body.[10]\nAt Gore's trial, he chose to represent himself. He was convicted of first-degree murder and armed robbery with a deadly weapon. The jury recommended that Gore be sentenced to death by a unanimous vote. Gore made frequent verbal outbursts during his trial and laughed out loud and howled.[10]\n",

On arrival, the body of Emma Hilliard was discovered, decapitated, with a drunk Manuel holding a jack knife. Despite her having been married, Manuel claimed Hilliard was his girlfriend. Hilliard is reported to have had \"no shortage of men in her past\", including an ex-husband, Benjamin Levins. Manuel immediately arrested. In July, Manuel pleaded guilty, despite not having any recollection of the crime; he claimed this was due to his having been drunk, and believed that witnesses who saw him attack Hilliard were telling the truth.[1]\nOn June 28, 1926, 3 members of the Rowell family and their tenant, mechanic Charles Alexander, were found hacked to death with an axe in their home at 116 South Nebraska Avenue. The bodies were found after a neighboring housewife claimed she felt something was wrong that morning due to a lack of visible activity by the family.[2] Rumors began to spread shortly after the killings that Bee Rowell, the 45-year-old Rowell family patriarch, had told people around Tampa that Manuel was innocent of killing Hilliard and that he knew who the real killer was. Multiple suspects were questioned, but no charges were filed. This led investigators to review the Hilliard case, and they discovered the witnesses who identified Manuel as the attacker were incredible, but evidence to clear him of suspicion in the case was elusive.[1]\nOn May 27, 1927, 5 members of the Merrell family, including 5-week-old baby Lester Merrell, were found killed in their home on the corner of 1st Avenue and 31st Street. The bodies were found by 15-year-old Kenneth Merrell, coming home from a night out with friends in St. Petersburg. His brother Hugh, 8, was in the house unharmed; his brother, 3-year-old Buddy Merrell had been killed in the same room as him, but Hugh had fallen under his bed and was not seen by the killer. As investigators searched the house, the murder weapon was found in the front bedroom: an unusual hammer, identified as a railroad spike driver, leading to suspicion the perpetrator was a railroad worker.[3]\nAt 4:30 that morning, a woman driving through the neighborhood saw a man walk along the street and stop in front of the Merrell home. Investigators suspected this man was the killer; he actually turned out he was a workman looking for the residence of a friend who was going to drive him to work; he found the friend's house shortly after stopping in front of the Merrell's.[4]\nThe next day, two men asked a local fortune teller, Mrs. Lizzell Banta, if \"they were going to get into trouble about this Merrell mess\"; she initially thought they were just giving her ridiculous questions, something she regularly experienced, but called police after becoming suspicious of them.[4]\nThe afternoon of the day after the Merrill murders, Lieutenant D. Z. Meeks of the Tampa Police reported a discovery he had made in a lumber yard 1/2 mile from the Merrill residence. In between the stacks of lumber, a newspaper detailing the Merrill family murders was laid out on the ground with bread loaf scraps and a few hand-rolled cigarette butts; it appeared that someone had been sleeping at the site. Nearby, 3 broken matches were found; broken matches had also been found at the Merrell home. Meeks and his officers set up in the lumber yard, and caught the man sleeping there shortly after midnight and arrested him.[4]\nThe prisoner gave his name as B. F. Levins, age 38; fisherman, laborer, and itinerant worker; born in a small settlement called Bullfrog on the edge of the Everglades, and had lived in Tampa for 5 or 6 years. While in custody he broke a match like the others and his boot print was matched to one found at the Merrill home. He acknowledged having been at the Merrill home that night, but claimed he was not the killer. He said this was a man named Leonard Thompson, who was a friend of Levins.[4]\nHe said that he and Thompson had been drinking together when Thompson said \"Merrell done me a dirty trick and I'm going to get him tonight\". They walked up the railroad tracks to the Merrell home, and Levins laid in the grass while Thompson entered the house. After hearing some noises in the house, Levins lit a match by the back door and saw the bodies. He left immediately, with Thompson taking him to Mrs. Banta's tent the next day.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Carol City murders were a series of murders that took place predominantly in Carol City, Florida and in and around Miami-Dade County between October 1974 and January 1978. The murders were committed by American mass murderer and serial killer John Errol Ferguson (February 27, 1948 \u2013 August 5, 2013)[1] who murdered at least eight people but is believed to have killed up to twelve. He was aided in six of the murders by two accomplices: Marvin Francois (January 18, 1946 \u2013 May 29, 1985)[2] and Beauford White (October 29, 1945 \u2013 August 28, 1987).[2]\nOn July 27, 1977, Ferguson, Francois, and White entered a drug house in Carol City where they tied up a total of eight people and shot all of them in the head execution-style. Only two of the eight survived. At the time, the incident was the largest case of mass murder in Miami-Dade County history. Months after the massacre, Ferguson murdered a teenage couple in Hialeah after raping the female victim. He is also suspected to be responsible for the May 1977 murders of an elderly couple and is suspected of killing a further two men in 1974.[3]\nFerguson, Francois, and White were all eventually captured, sentenced to death, and executed by the state of Florida. Francois was executed in the electric chair on May 29, 1985, followed by White, who was executed in the electric chair on August 28, 1987. Ferguson was executed over two decades later by lethal injection on August 5, 2013, following years of appeals over his sanity.[4][5]\nFerguson, the fourth oldest of eight children, had been known to psychiatrists since he was 10. His father died when he was 13 and his mother had managed to take care of the children on her own. Ferguson dropped out of school after repeating 9th grade three times.[6] Ferguson had his first police encounter when he was 13 after being caught driving someone else's car without their consent. He would continue to get in trouble with the police throughout his youth. In 1969, Ferguson tried to kill a police officer after a traffic stop. He disarmed officer Edward Hartman, ordered him on his knees, and told him to beg for his life. Hartman complied, but also slipped a revolver out of his boot. Ferguson fired four shots at Hartman but missed all of them. Hartman then shot Ferguson four times.[6]\nIn 1975, a court-appointed psychiatrist diagnosed John Ferguson as \"dangerous to himself and others ... homicidal ... a man who should not be released under any circumstances.\" Another psychiatrist said Ferguson's potential for recovery was minimal and that the probability of him returning to a life of crime was very high. He described Ferguson as \"explosive ... a dangerous person who cannot cope with day to day living.\" Ferguson bragged to his friends that he had feigned insanity and misled the doctors. A woman who knew him later said, \"He was into psychology. He told us he psyched them out. He'd say things like 'See that airplane flying in the room?'\"[6]\nAfter repeatedly escaping from a hospital, Ferguson, who had previously been acquitted of six robberies and two assaults on the grounds of insanity, was sent to the more secure Florida State Hospital. In June 1976, doctors said Ferguson's treatment was complete and that further hospitalization was not necessary. Ferguson was sent to Miami to face charges of resisting arrest after a hospital escape. Although a psychiatrist warned that he was \"unpredictable and a danger to himself and others\", a judge ruled Ferguson competent and later accepted a guilty plea. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison and two years of probation, and released 225 days later.[6]\nFrancois, whose parents were not married, had an impoverished upbringing. His father was a deadbeat heroin addict who brought other addicts into the home to take heroin in front of his son and beat Francois when he would not fight with the other children. Francois's mother was a sex worker who did not do much for her son. She married, but Francois's stepfather abused him. Although Francois did not finish school, he did obtain his GED.[7]\nWhite had a lengthy criminal record dating back to July 1963, and was on parole for assault with intent to commit rape at the time of the murders.[8]\nOn October 30, 1974, James Ward, a 40-year-old mental hospital escapee, was murdered. His body was dumped in Collier County and he was killed by a shotgun blast. On November 1, the body of another man named Joseph Walters was found near railroad tracks in Miami by a freight train employee. Walters had also been killed by a shotgun blast but had additionally been shot repeatedly with a handgun. There were no leads in the Walters case until February 1977, when the mother of the man convicted of Ward's murder made contact with Linda Blue, the lead homicide detective who was investigating the case. Convicted killer Edward Eugene Oliver had been spotted leaving the area where Ward's body had been found and was ultimately convicted of murdering him. Oliver made contact with Blue and claimed he wanted to talk about both murders.[9][10]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nGiuseppe Zangara (September 7, 1900\u00a0\u2013 March 20, 1933) was an Italian immigrant and naturalized United States citizen who attempted to assassinate the President-elect of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, on February 15, 1933, 17 days before Roosevelt's inauguration.[1] During a night speech by Roosevelt in Miami, Florida, Zangara fired five shots with a handgun he had purchased a couple of days before. He missed his target and instead injured five bystanders and killed Anton Cermak, the Mayor of Chicago.[2]\nZangara was born on September 7, 1900, in Ferruzzano, Calabria, Italy. After serving in the Tyrolean Alps in World War I, he did a variety of menial jobs in his home village before emigrating with his uncle to the United States in 1923. He settled in Paterson, New Jersey, and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1929.\nZangara had little education and worked as a bricklayer. He suffered severe pain in his abdomen, which doctors told him was chronic and incurable. In 1926 he underwent an appendectomy, but it was no help; if anything, it may have made his pain worse. The doctors who performed his autopsy attributed his abdominal pain to adhesions they found on his gallbladder. In his prison memoir, Zangara himself attributed his pain to being forced to do grueling physical labor on his father's farm from an early age. He wrote that his pain began when he was six years old.[3]\nObservers at the time and following his execution have discussed his mental state. Arguments have been made that Zangara was mentally ill, incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, and ought to have had an insanity defense presented on his behalf while others have contended that he was sane.[4][5]\nOn February 15, 1933, Roosevelt was giving an impromptu speech at night from the back of an open car in the Bayfront Park area of Miami, Florida, where Zangara was working the occasional odd job and living off his savings. Zangara, armed with a .32-caliber US Revolver Company[6] pistol he had bought for $8 (equivalent to $170 in 2021) at a local pawn shop, joined the crowd of spectators, but as he was only 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) tall, he was unable to see over other people and had to stand on a wobbly metal folding chair, peering over the hat of Lillian Cross to get a clear aim at his target from 25 feet away.[7] He placed his gun over Mrs. Cross' right shoulder. (She was only about 4 inches taller than he was and weighed 105 pounds)[citation needed]\nAfter Zangara fired the first shot, Cross and others grabbed his arm, and he fired four more shots wildly. Five people were hit:[8] Mrs. Joseph H. Gill (seriously wounded in the abdomen);[9] Miss Margaret Kruis of Newark, New Jersey, (minor wound in hand and a scalp wound);[10][11][12] New York detective/bodyguard William Sinnott (superficial head wound); Russell Caldwell of Miami (flesh wound on the forehead);[13] and Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was standing on the running board of the car next to Roosevelt. Mrs Cross had powder burns on her right cheek.[14] A Secret Service agent Bob Clark had a grazed hand, possibly caused by the bullet that struck Cermak.[15] The intended target, Roosevelt, was unharmed.[citation needed]\nRoosevelt cradled the mortally wounded Cermak in his arms as the car rushed to the hospital; after arriving there, Cermak spoke to Roosevelt, and before he died 19 days later, allegedly uttered the line that is engraved on his tomb: \"I'm glad it was me, not you.\" The Tribune reported the quote without attributing it to a witness, and most scholars doubt it was ever said.[16]\nZangara confessed in the Dade County Courthouse jail, stating: \"I have the gun in my hand. I kill kings and presidents first and next all capitalists.\" He pleaded guilty to four counts of attempted murder and was sentenced to 80 years in prison. As he was led out of the courtroom, Zangara told the judge: \"Four times 20 is 80. Oh, judge, don't be stingy. Give me a hundred years.\"[17]\n",

After releasing her debut EP, Find Me (2011), her YouTube channel reached one million subscribers. After she reached two million subscribers, she released her debut studio album, With Love (2013).\nGrimmie then became a contestant on season six of The Voice, finishing in third place. Adam Levine, her coach on the show, announced in the finale that, regardless of the results, he would sign her to his label 222 Records. Lil Wayne also offered to sign her to his label, Young Money Entertainment. She was signed with Island Records for a short time before being dropped.\nGrimmie released her second EP, Side A, in 2016. That same year, she took on an acting role, making her first and only motion picture appearance in The Matchbreaker. On June 10, 2016, Grimmie was fatally shot while signing autographs following a concert performance at The Plaza Live in Orlando, Florida.\nSide B, a follow up to Side A, was made available on Spotify and iTunes in 2017, and in June 2017, Grimmie's second and final album, All Is Vanity, was released posthumously.

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

Carr, a former television repairman, additionally admitted to molesting more than a dozen children until his apprehension. Following his arrest, he was sentenced to life imprisonment, which he served until his death in 2007.[2][3]\nRobert Frederick Carr III was born on December 22, 1943, in Virginia. According to his confession, he had a troubled childhood, reportedly being forced into prostitution at 11-years-old and stealing cars as a teen.[3] As an adult, he moved to Connecticut, where he would ultimately start a relationship and get married, as well as getting a job fixing TVs. Carr would later admit that when having sex he would fantasize about committing rape and murder.[3]\nIn late 1972, Carr visited Florida and on November 13, 1972, he picked up 11-year-old friends Todd Payton and Mark Wilson, who were hitchhiking from North Miami Beach. The inside back doors in the car were disabled and the trunk was filled with food, jars of petroleum jelly, and a shovel. Carr raped the boys and strangled Payton. Four days later, he strangled Wilson, for which he would receive an additional 20 years in prison when he was eventually sentenced.[4] After the murders, he drove to Mississippi and Louisiana, burying one boy in each state.[3] Both boys were subsequently reported missing by their parents when they did not return home.\nTammy Ruth Huntley, 16, vanished while waiting for her mother to pick her up. Carr drove her from Miami to Mississippi. On April 7, 1972, after raping her over the 10 days he kept her captive in the woods, he strangled her, saying, \"I killed her because she looked like she was getting despondent.\"[5][6][7]\nIn 1973, Carr was convicted of rape in Connecticut, but was paroled in 1976. Upon his release in Connecticut, he would kill his fourth and final victim, 21-year-old Rhonda Holloway, before burying her body in a rural area.[8]\nOn May 30, 1976 Carr raped a hitchhiker at knife point. During the attack, a Metro police officer stumbled upon the car and witnessed the rape, arresting Carr.[2][9] Once in interrogation, Carr surprised detectives by confessing to four murders,[3] explaining the crimes in detail. Carr, along with detectives David Simmons, Charles Zatrepalek and deputy medical examiner Ronald Wright, went on a long mission to find the bodies.[8]\nCarr confessed that after Huntley's murder he raped an additional four girls and two boys. Only four were reported, for which he was charged and plead guilty.[7]\nCarr received a life sentence after pleading guilty, meaning he would be spared the death penalty.[10] He served part of his sentence at a state mental hospital, but was kicked out after it was found he was hoarding wire cutters and pliers.[3] Afterwards he began mailing letters to prosecutor Ed O'Donnell, who had previously worked on the case.[3]\nOn July 6, 2007, Carr died at the Union Correctional Institution from unspecified causes.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn February 14, 2018, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Miami suburban town of Parkland, Florida, murdering 17 people[note 2] and injuring 17 others.[2][3][4] Cruz, a former student at the school, fled the scene on foot by blending in with other students, and was arrested without incident approximately one hour later in nearby Coral Springs.[5] Police and prosecutors investigated \"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\".[6]\nThe killing spree is the deadliest high school shooting in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre that killed 15, including the perpetrators, in Colorado in April 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

        "paragraph": "Florida Army National Guard\nGovernor Bob Graham\nMayor Maurice Ferr\u00e9\nThe 1980 Miami riots were race riots that occurred in Miami, Florida, starting in earnest on May 18, 1980,[1] following an all-White male jury acquitting four Dade County Public Safety Department officers in the death of Arthur McDuffie (December 3, 1946 \u2013 December 21, 1979), a Black insurance salesman and United States Marine Corps lance corporal.  McDuffie was beaten to death by four police officers after a traffic stop. After the officers were tried and acquitted on charges including manslaughter and evidence tampering, a riot broke out in the Black neighborhoods of Overtown and Liberty City on the night of May 17. Riots continued until May 20, resulting in at least 18 deaths and an estimated $100\u00a0million in property damage.\nIn 1981 Dade County settled a civil lawsuit filed by McDuffie's family for $1.1\u00a0million.  The 1980 Miami riots were the deadliest urban riots in a single city since the 1967 Detroit riot and remained such until the 1992 Los Angeles riots twelve years later.\nIn the early morning hours of December 17, 1979, a group of six White police officers[2] stopped thirty-three-year-old McDuffie, who was riding a black-and-orange 1973 Kawasaki Z1 motorcycle.[3] McDuffie had accumulated traffic citations and was riding with a suspended license. According to the initial police report, he had led police on an eight-minute high-speed chase through residential streets at speeds of over 80 miles per hour (130\u00a0km/h).\nIn that initial report, four of the officers involved in the chase[a] claimed McDuffie had run a red light or stop sign and subsequently led police on an eight-minute chase. Sgt. Herbert Evans (who was not at the scene) added that McDuffie lost control of his motorcycle while making a left turn[3] and, according to Officer Charles Veverka, McDuffie subsequently struck his head on the ground,[3] after which he attempted to flee on foot. The officers caught him and a scuffle ensued in which McDuffie allegedly kicked Sgt. Ira Diggs, who wrote \"the subject was observed to be fighting violently.\"[3] Police drove a squad car over the motorbike to make the incident look like an accident.[4]\nMcDuffie was transported to a nearby hospital where he died four days later of his injuries. McDuffie's ex-wife, who was planning to re-marry him on February 7, 1980, was on duty as a nurse's aide when he was transported to Jackson Memorial Hospital.[5] The coroner's report concluded that he had suffered multiple skull fractures, one of which was 10 inches (250\u00a0mm) long.[6]\nThe medical examiner, Dr. Ronald Wright, said McDuffie's injuries were not consistent with a motorcycle crash, and that if McDuffie had fallen off the motorcycle, as the police claimed, it did not make sense that its gauges would be broken. Wright said that it seemed that he had been beaten to death.[7]:\u200a194\u200a\n\u00a0\"In the process of arresting and handcuffing him, McDuffie's helmet was removed and he was thrown to the ground. Officers Ira Diggs, Michael Watts, William Hanlon and Alex Marrero proceeded to strike McDuffie in and around the head and chest with flashlights and nightsticks no less that five times.\u00a0\"During this time, the defendants used their flashlights and nightsticks to repeatedly strike the motorcycle upon which McDuffie had been riding and which, at the time he was initially apprehended, was undamaged.\u00a0\"At the instructions of Sergeant Herb Evans, the defendants subsequently reported that the injuries to McDuffie and damage to his motorcycle were the result of a motorcycle accident. There was no accident.\"\n",

He was also the owner of Brumos, a Jacksonville, Florida car dealership and racing team.\nGregg was born in New York City, the son of a mechanical engineer and manufacturer of marine incinerators.[1][2]\nHe graduated from the Deerfield Academy, a private prep school,[2] in 1957 and moved on to Harvard University, where he earned a degree in English in 1961.[3] He had a brief career in filmmaking while also competing as a squash player and then eventually settling on auto racing.[2] After graduating from Harvard,[4] he moved to Europe and attended the Centro-Sud Driving School.[3] He then joined the U.S. Navy and became an air intelligence officer. He was assigned to the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida, and served there until discharged in 1965.[3] He was married to Jennifer Johnson and had two sons, Jason and Simon.\nHis legacy lives on in the Peter Gregg Foundation.\nWhile at school, Gregg began his motorsport career in gymkhanas and ice races after an initial appearance in a hill climb in 1958 in Laconia, New Hampshire.[2]\nIn 1963 he drove an unmodified production Corvette in Osceola County, Florida and won the SCCA sanctioned race. He became a serious Porsche racer in 1964 with a Porsche 904 and then moved into competition with a Porsche 906.[2] In 1965 he purchased Brumos Porsche, a local dealership, after the death of the owner, Hubert Brundage.[3] He was the SCCA's Southeastern Division champion in 1967 in two classes and scored victories in Daytona and Sebring.[2] In 1968 he acquired a Mercedes-Benz dealership and entered competition in the SCCA's Under-2-Litre section of the Trans-Am Series. He won six Trans-Am races in 1969 and also took the SCCA's B Sedan National Championship. In 1970, he opened a third dealership, SportAuto, selling Fiats and MGs.[3]\nIn 1971, he was part of the major Trans-Am Series, driving Bud Moore Ford Mustangs, alongside teammate George Follmer.[3] He won the Trans-Am Series in 1973 and 1974 in a Brumos Porsche. By this time, he was involved with IMSA and won the IMSA GTO overall championship in 1971 and 1973, earning him the nickname \"Peter Perfect\", possibly a reference to a character in a Hanna-Barbera cartoon called the \"Wacky Races\" and his clean-cut naval officer image. In 1973 he won the 24 Hours of Daytona in a Porsche Carrera co-driven by Hurley Haywood. He then announced his retirement to lead a life as a director of the Jacksonville National Bank,[3] a club tennis player and a speedboat racer out of the Ponte Vedra Yacht Club.[2]\nGregg retracted his retirement and won the 24 Hours of Daytona three more times, in 1975, 1976, and 1978.[3] His 1976 Daytona victory in the #59 BMW E9 Coupe Sport Leicht (CSL) \"Batmobile\" (the first product of what would become the BMW M Motorsport subsidiary) with co-driver Brian Redman is cited as BMW's first major victory on American soil.[5]\nGregg won IMSA GTO overall championships in 1974, 1975, 1978, and 1979, giving him six career titles in the class. In June 1980, he was due to compete at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in a 924 Carrera GTS for the Porsche factory team along with fellow American Al Holbert, but was injured near Paris; en route to a practice session for the race,[3] he attempted to overtake an ox cart, but a car pulled out in front of him and, in attempting to avoiding a collision,[6] his car careered into a ditch.[4] Artist Frank Stella was his passenger.[7] When doctors refused to allow Gregg to race his place was taken by Derek Bell.[4]\n",

The crime scene was described as \"very complicated\" by the FBI special agent in charge.[1] The president of Miami-Dade's police union claimed that at least eleven officers opened fire on the UPS truck in response to the robbers' firing first.[2]\nAt approximately 4:14 p.m., Lamar Alexander and Ronnie Jerome Hill robbed the jewelry store, Regent Jeweler at Miracle Mile in Coral Gables, Florida.[3] They held the store's cashier at gunpoint and stole diamonds. The two suspects exchanged gunfire with the store owner during the robbery,[4] injuring one jewelry shop worker and hitting nearby Coral Gables City Hall with a stray bullet, causing that building to be placed on lock down.[5][6]\nPolice were alerted when the store's silent alarm system went off. Ninety seconds later, when officers arrived, the gunmen opened fire on the officers, who then returned fire on the gunmen. The gunmen left in a U-Haul van, which they later ditched in a suburban neighborhood one mile away.[7] The suspects then carjacked a UPS delivery truck at gunpoint and took the driver hostage. The two continued their escape in the UPS truck, heading on Interstate 75 into Broward County.[5]\nSeveral police cars pursued the suspects until the UPS truck became boxed in by slow-moving rush hour traffic in Miramar, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) north of the jewelry store.[8] Police then took cover behind the cars containing bystanders and later claimed the suspects opened fire first[8] however, the lawyer representing the two innocent victims of the shooting cites witness testimony that the police shot first.[9] A total of nineteen officers fired at the suspects, including thirteen members of the Miami-Dade Police Department. The other six officers were from the Miramar Police Department and the Pembroke Pines Police Department.[10] The pursuit and shootout were broadcast live on television by news helicopters.[8]\nFour people were killed in the shootout. Both robbery suspects,  Lamar Alexander, and Ronnie Jerome Hill, both 41, were killed by police. The hijacked UPS driver, Frank Ordonez, 27, and bystander Richard Cutshaw, 70, were also both killed in the shootout;[6] the Florida Department of Law Enforcement has not released the result of ballistics investigations that would indicate whether Ordonez and Cutshaw were shot by police or robbers.[11][12] A female store employee was shot and wounded in the initial robbery.[7][13]\nThe sister of Ordonez, who had been taken hostage, expressed her anger that the police responded quickly with gunfire, and did not attempt to negotiate the hostage situation, which she believed caused her brother's death.[13]\nAt a vigil the following year, Ordonez's brother said \"The police murdered my brother on live TV and we all had to watch in horror.\"[14] Lawsuits were later filed on behalf of Ordonez and Cutshaw, alleging that the police agencies involved had behaved negligently.[15] The litigation stalled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[15] Florida Department of Law Enforcement finished their investigation on Sept 17, 2021, and turned it over to  the Broward state attorney\u2019s office.[16]\n",

The doctrine broadens murder liability for participants in violent felonies to include a killing by an accomplice. As the prosecutor David Rimmer explained: \"No car, no murder.\" The victim's father, Terry Snyder, concurred: \"It never would have happened unless Ryan Holle had lent the car. It was as good as if he was there.\"[2]\nAllen said in a pretrial deposition that all Holle did \"was to say, 'Use the car.' I mean, nobody really knew that girl was going to get killed. It was not in the plans to go kill somebody, you know.\" Holle had no criminal record. He had lent his car to Allen countless times before. In a 2007 interview with The New York Times, Holle stated that \"I honestly thought they were going to get food,\" adding that \"When they actually mentioned what was going on, I thought it was a joke.\" He added that he was naive, and had been drinking all night, so he \"didn't understand what was going on.\"[2]\nHolle was the only involved person to be offered a plea bargain that might have led to a sentence of only 10 years, but he refused the deal. Holle's trial lasted one day, including testimony, jury deliberations, conviction, and sentencing.[2] On June 24, 2015, Holle's sentence was reduced by Governor Rick Scott to 25 years in prison and 10 years of probation.[6] Holle's projected release date is June 30, 2024.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Rosewood massacre was a racially motivated massacre of black people and the destruction of a black town that took place during the first week of January 1923 in rural Levy County, Florida, United States. At least six black people and two white people were killed, but eyewitness accounts suggested a higher death toll of 27 to 150. The town of Rosewood was destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black men in the years before the massacre,[2] including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.[citation needed]\nBefore the massacre, the town of Rosewood had been a quiet, primarily black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been assaulted by a black drifter. A mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. For several days, survivors from the town hid in nearby swamps until they were evacuated to larger towns by train and car. No arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black and white residents; none of them ever moved back, none of them were ever compensated for the loss of their land, and the town ceased to exist.\nAlthough the rioting was widely reported around the United States at the time, few official records documented the event. The survivors, their descendants, and the perpetrators all remained silent about Rosewood for decades. Sixty years after the rioting, the story of Rosewood was revived by major media outlets when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s. The survivors and their descendants all organized in an attempt to sue the state for failing to protect Rosewood's black community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned a report on the incident. As a result of the findings, Florida compensated the survivors and their descendants for the damages which they had incurred because of racial violence. The incident was the subject of a 1997 feature film which was directed by John Singleton. In 2004, the state designated the site of Rosewood as a Florida Heritage Landmark.\nOfficially, the recorded death toll during the first week of January 1923 was eight (six blacks and two whites). Some survivors' stories claim that up to 27 black residents were killed, and they also assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths. Minnie Lee Langley, who was in the Carrier house when it was besieged, recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house.[3] A newspaper article which was published in 1984 stated that estimates of up to 150 victims may have been exaggerations.[4] Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave which was filled with the bodies of black people; one of them remembers seeing 26 bodies being covered with a plow which was brought from Cedar Key. However, by the time authorities investigated these claims, most of the witnesses were dead or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories.[5]\nRosewood was settled in 1847, nine miles (14\u00a0km) east of Cedar Key, near the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the local economy drew on the timber industry; the name Rosewood refers to the reddish color of cut cedar wood. Two pencil mills were founded nearby in Cedar Key; local residents also worked in several turpentine mills and a sawmill three miles (4.8\u00a0km) away in Sumner, in addition to farming of citrus and cotton.  The hamlet grew enough to warrant the construction of a post office and train depot on the Florida Railroad in 1870, but it was never incorporated as a town.[3]\nInitially, Rosewood had both black and white settlers.  When most of the cedar trees in the area had been cut by 1890, the pencil mills closed, and many white residents moved to Sumner. By 1900, the population in Rosewood had become predominantly black.  The village of Sumner was predominantly white, and relations between the two communities were relatively amicable.[6] Two black families in Rosewood named Goins and Carrier were the most powerful. The Goins family brought the turpentine industry to the area, and in the years preceding the attacks were the second largest landowners in Levy County.[7] To avoid lawsuits from white competitors, the Goins brothers moved to Gainesville, and the population of Rosewood decreased slightly.[3] The Carriers were also a large family, primarily working at logging in the region. By the 1920s, almost everyone in the close-knit community was distantly related to each other.[8] The population of Rosewood peaked in 1915 at 355 people. Florida had effectively disenfranchised black voters since the start of the 20th century by high requirements for voter registration; both Sumner and Rosewood were part of a single voting precinct counted by the U.S. Census. In 1920, the combined population of both towns was 638 (344 black and 294 white).[9]\nAs was common in the late 19th century South, Florida had imposed legal racial segregation under Jim Crow laws requiring separate black and white public facilities and transportation.[10] Black and white residents created their own community centers: by 1920, the residents of Rosewood were mostly self-sufficient.  They had three churches, a school, a large Masonic Hall, a turpentine mill, a sugarcane mill, a baseball team named the Rosewood Stars, and two general stores, one of which was white-owned.  The village had about a dozen two-story wooden plank homes, other small two-room houses, and several small unoccupied plank farm and storage structures.[3] Some families owned pianos, organs, and other symbols of middle-class prosperity. Survivors of Rosewood remember it as a happy place.  In 1995, survivor Robie Mortin recalled at age 79 that when she was a child there, that \"Rosewood was a town where everyone's house was painted. There were roses everywhere you walked. Lovely.\"[11]\nRacial violence at the time was common throughout the nation, manifested as individual incidents of extra-legal actions, or attacks on entire communities. Lynchings reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising black voters and imposing white supremacy; white supremacists used it as a means of social control throughout the South. In 1866 Florida, as did many Southern states, passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens.[12] Although these were quickly overturned, and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing, by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil. The white Democratic-dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885, which largely served to disenfranchise all poor voters. Losing political power, black voters suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following.[13] Without the right to vote, they were excluded as jurors and could not run for office, effectively excluding them from the political process. The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes: an influx of European immigrants, industrialization and the growth of cities, and political experimentation in the North. In the South, black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second-class citizens.[14]\nElected officials in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905\u20131909) suggested finding a location out of state for black people to live separately. Tens of thousands of people moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration, unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913\u20131917) and Sidney Catts (1917\u20131921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state.[6] By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.[3]\n",

Roselli was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in a plot to assassinate Cuban leader Fidel Castro.[1]\nRoselli was born Filippo Sacco on July 4, 1905, in Esperia, Lazio, Italy.[2] His father, Vincenzo Sacco, had moved to the United States first, followed by Filippo at the age of 6, who had immigrated with his mother, Mariantonia Pascale Sacco to Boston, Massachusetts.[2] His father died in 1918.[3]\nIn 1922, Sacco was arrested on narcotics charges in Massachusetts.[4] He first fled to New York for three months,[2] before moving on to Chicago, where he changed his name from Filippo Sacco to John Roselli.[4]\nRoselli moved to Los Angeles in 1924, pleading guilty to bootlegging that same year.[5] [6] Roselli began his California criminal career working for small-time bootleggers, becoming the top truck driver for Tony Cornero. Eventually, Roselli was promoted to working closely with the Cornero brothers in securing the liquor imports into Southern California. He was especially important in bribing and securing the loyalty of Orange County officials, opening up their ports for the gang's use. In 1926, Tony Cornero fled to Canada, escaping a 2-year bootlegging sentence. As a result of the gang's dissolution, Roselli went independent. He became further involved in several LA area vice rackets, especially prostitution and gambling.[7]\nRoselli first met Al Capone in 1927, on a trip to Chicago to attend the Jack Dempsey-Gene Tunney Boxing match. Capone was holding a party that night at his headquarters, Metropole Hotel, where Johnny was able to briefly meet him and the Chicago Outfit's inner circle. Roselli next met with Capone at the Biltmore Hotel in Downtown Los Angeles. In 1928, Capone invited Roselli to Chicago, this time offering him a role in his organization. Roselli was tasked with working with the Los Angeles crime family, to keep an eye on Capone's investments and facilitate cooperation between the LA and Chicago organizations. The LA branch of the mafia was at the time under the leadership of Joseph Ardizzone, and Roselli worked closely with Ardizonne's underboss Jack Dragna.[7]\nDuring this time, Roselli was involved with Los Angeles' offshore gambling racket. He led the mob's hostile takeover of the Monfalcone gambling ship. Roselli's underworld activities sometimes had to be put on hold while he dealt with long bouts of tuberculosis.[7]\nRoselli became close friends with film producer Bryan Foy, who brought Roselli into the movie business as a producer with Foy's small production company, Eagle Lion Studios, where Roselli is credited on a number of early gangster movies as a producer. Roselli was also close friends with Columbia Pictures co-founder Harry Cohn.[7]\nIn 1931, LA Mafia boss Joseph Ardizzone survived two assassination attempts and declared he would retire. Instead, he disappeared in October 1931 and Jack Dragna took his place as Don. \nIn July 1933, Frank L. Shaw began his term as the Los Angeles mayor. He put in place a heinously corrupt administration where the city's underworld paid regular bribes directly to city hall. Roselli was able to use his position in LA's mafia and deep knowledge of the city's underworld to make himself the liaison between the mayor's office and the various gangs and individuals who sent regular payoffs to city hall. This favored position with the city government helped to position Jack Dragna's organization as the preeminent criminal organization in Los Angeles under the Shaw administration. [7]\n",

She was assassinated while preaching in Miami, Florida.\nLaura Adorkor Kofi (surname variously spelled as Kofy, Koffey or Kofey) was born near Accra, Ghana, possibly into a royal family. A plaque at her gravesite gives the title \"Princess\", and 1893 as a birthdate; other sources put her birthdate much earlier.[1] Some versions of her early life also say that she experienced visions and voices which encouraged her to go abroad and teach Africans in America.[2] Her detractors in her last years spread rumors that she was born \"Laura Champion\" in Athens, Georgia; but religious history scholar Richard S. Newman compiled evidence to confirm that she was, in fact, Ghanaian by birth.[3]\nKofi moved to North America around 1918, and lived in Detroit for several years. She worked as national field director for Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, touring the deep South and attracting large crowds[4] as a \"prophet\" (in her own estimation), with her base in Jacksonville, Florida.[5] In 1927 she founded the African Universal Church, with herself as its head (\"Warrior Mother of Africa's Warriors of the Most High God\" was her self-chosen title).[1] Garvey soon decided that she was building too much of a following independent of his cause, and announced, \"This woman is a fake and has no authority from me to speak.\"[6] He also encouraged his followers to have her arrested for fraud.[7]\nIn March 1928, Laura Adorkor Kofi was shot while speaking from the pulpit at a church in Miami. She died from the gunshot wound to her head; a Jamaican follower of Marcus Garvey, Maxwell Cook, presumed to be her assailant, was immediately beaten to death by the congregation who witnessed the attack.[3] Ten thousand people are said to have attended her funerals in several cities; her remains were dressed in robes of black, green and red, placed in a bronze casket, and entombed in a mausoleum in Jacksonville's Old City Cemetery.[6]\nHer congregation called a new pastor from South Africa, Eli Nyombolo. They continued her work as the Missionary African Universal Church. In the 1940s, on the outskirts of Jacksonville, they built a small settlement they called \"Adorkaville\" after Mother Kofi.[8] (Most of Adorkaville was demolished by the city in the 1970s, after Nyombolo died and the church experienced infighting and schism.)[6]\nThere is a small collection of research materials related to Laura Adorkor Kofi at the New York Public Library.[9]\nThis African American\u2013related article is a stub.

In early 1974, Knowles was serving time at Raiford Prison in Florida (now known as Florida State Prison) when he began corresponding with a divorcee in San Francisco, eventually becoming engaged. His fianc\u00e9e paid for his legal counsel and, upon his release, Knowles flew directly to California to be with her, but she called off the wedding. Knowles claimed to have murdered three people on the streets of San Francisco that night, but that has never been verified.\nKnowles returned to Jacksonville, Florida. He was soon arrested after stabbing a bartender during a fight, but he picked a lock in his detention cell and escaped on July 26, 1974.\nAfter his escape from police custody, Knowles began a four-month, multistate crime spree. At the time, the crimes were not linked but after Knowles' capture authorities discovered he had recorded audiotaped confessions that he mailed to an attorney. These tapes were never released to the public, but were reviewed by a grand jury in 1975. The tapes, along with all transcripts, were destroyed \"after being ruined beyond repair in a flood of the Federal Courthouse in Macon,\" according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.[2]\nOn the night of his escape from police custody, Knowles broke into the home of 65-year-old Alice Curtis and gagged her, ransacked her home for money and valuables, then stole her car. Curtis choked to death due to being gagged.[3]\nIn his taped confessions, Knowles claimed to have murdered a teenage girl named \"Alma.\" On December 21, 2011, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation identified this victim as 13-year-old Ima Jean Sanders, who disappeared on August 1, 1974 in Warner Robins, Georgia, and whose skeletal remains were found in April 1976.[4][2]\nKnowles claimed to have kidnapped and killed 11-year-old Lillian and 7-year-old Mylette Anderson outside of Jacksonville, Florida, on Aug. 1, 1974. Although the girls' disappearance was never solved, investigators have said they believe this was a false confession [5]\nOn August 2, 1974, Knowles met Marjorie Howie, 49, in Atlantic Beach, Florida. She was found strangled in her apartment and her television set was stolen.[6]\nOn August 23, 1974, Knowles forced his way into the home of Kathie Sue Pierce in Musella, Georgia. Knowles strangled Pierce, but left her three-year-old son physically unharmed.[7]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nChristopher Bernard Wilder (March 13, 1945\u00a0\u2013 April 13, 1984), also known as the Beauty Queen Killer, was an Australian serial killer[1] who abducted and raped at least twelve young women and girls, torturing some, and killing at least eight of them, during a six-week, cross-country crime spree in the United States in early 1984. Wilder's series of murders began in Florida on February 26, 1984, and continued across the country through Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Nevada, and California, and attempted abductions in Washington State and New York State before he was killed during a struggle with police in New Hampshire on April 13, 1984. Wilder is also believed to have raped two girls, aged 10 and 12, in Florida in 1983. Since his death, he has also been considered a suspect in many unsolved murders, including the unsolved 1965 murder of two teenaged girls in his native Sydney, where he had lived during the same period.\nChristopher Bernard Wilder was born on March 13, 1945, in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia,[2] the oldest of four sons to an American father, a naval officer, and an Australian mother. He nearly died at birth, and reportedly almost drowned in a swimming pool at the age of two.[3][4]\nOn January 4, 1963, aged 17, Wilder raped a 13-year-old girl in company with two other young men, both of whom denied being involved in the actual assault. Wilder was sentenced to probation, and claimed later in life that he also received electroshock therapy.[4][5] It has been suggested that this therapy aggravated Wilder's violent sexual tendencies.[6] However, journalist Duncan McNab claims there is no evidence that he underwent electroshock therapy, and that the story of Wilder's near-drowning was an invention of Wilder himself.[7]\nWilder married in 1968, but his wife left him after one week. He emigrated to the United States in 1969 and lived in Boynton Beach, Florida in an upscale home and was successful in real estate while developing an interest in photography. From about 1971 through 1975, Wilder faced various charges related to sexual misconduct.[8] He eventually raped a young woman he had lured into his truck on the pretense of photographing her for a modelling contract.[5] This was to become part of his modus operandi during his later crime spree. Despite several convictions, Wilder was never jailed for any of these offenses.[9]\nWhile visiting his parents in Australia in 1982, Wilder was charged with sexual offenses against two 15-year-old girls whom he had forced to pose nude. His parents posted bail and he was allowed to return to Florida to await trial, but court delays prevented his case from ever being heard, as the eventual initial hearing date of April 1984 came after his death.[10] In early 1984, Wilder began a bloody six-week, cross-country crime spree in the United States. He left in his wake eight murder victims, all female.[11]\nThe first murder attributed to Wilder was that of Rosario Teresa Gonzalez, who was last seen on February 26, 1984, at the Miami Grand Prix, where she was employed as a spokesmodel at a temporary job distributing samples of aspirin for a pharmaceutical company. She was paid $200 a day. Witnesses stated that she left the Grand Prix track between noon and 1:00 p.m. with a Caucasian man in his thirties. Her blue 1980 Oldsmobile Cutlass was found parked near Dupont Plaza. Wilder was a race car driver who frequented the Miami Grand Prix racetrack and was also at the race, where he raced in the IMSA GTU class in a Porsche 911. On March 5, Wilder's former girlfriend, Miss Florida finalist Elizabeth Ann Kenyon, 23, went missing. She dated Wilder for a period of time, and was proposed to by him, but she declined due to their age difference; she is  believed to have been last seen with him at a gas station near Miami. Her car was found six days later abandoned at the Miami Airport.[12] Gonzales was an aspiring model at the time of her disappearance and had participated in the Miss Florida beauty contest along with Elizabeth Kenyon. Neither woman's remains have ever been found. On March 18, Wilder led 21-year-old Theresa Wait Ferguson away from the Merritt Square Mall in Merritt Island, Florida. He murdered Ferguson and dumped her body at Canaveral Groves, where it was discovered on March 23.\nWilder's next victim was 19-year-old Linda Grover from Florida State University, whom he abducted from the Governor's Square Mall in Tallahassee, Florida, and transported to Bainbridge, Georgia, on March 20. She had declined his offer to photograph her for a modeling agency, after which he assaulted her in the mall parking lot. Wilder tied Grover's hands, wrapped her in a blanket, and put her in the trunk of his car. Grover was taken to Glen Oaks Motel and was raped. Wilder blinded her with a blow dryer and super glue. He applied copper wires to her feet and passed an electric current through them. When she tried to get away, he beat her, but she escaped and locked herself in the bathroom, where she began pounding on the walls. Wilder fled in his car, taking all of Grover's belongings with him.\nOn March 21, Wilder approached Terry Walden, a 23-year-old wife, mother, and nursing student at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, about posing as a model. She turned him down, but ran across him again two days later, March 23, and he kidnapped her then. Wilder stabbed her to death and dumped her body in a canal, where she was found on March 26. After killing Walden, Wilder fled in her rust-colored 1981 Mercury Cougar.\n",

McCullers and Reg H. Scott, allegedly went to Willie's house and took the youth from his mother at gunpoint. They picked up Willie's father, James Howard, at the Bond-Howell Lumber Company where he worked, then drove to the Suwannee River east of Suwannee Springs, where they bound Willie by the hands and feet, and forced the youth to choose between getting shot and jumping into the Suwannee River. After his father said he could do nothing to save him, Willie jumped into the river and drowned. Goff, McCullers, and Scott signed an affidavit which stated that they had only wanted James Howard to whip his son and, rather than be whipped by his father, Willie had committed suicide by jumping into the river. James Howard also signed the affidavit, but after selling his home and moving to Orlando, he recanted. Harry T. Moore, of the NAACP, interviewed the parents. After a county grand jury failed to indict, Moore was able to get a federal investigation started, but no convictions followed. Goff, McCullers, and Scott died without having to face murder charges.[2]\nA documentary film on the murder, Murder on the Suwannee River, was produced in 2006 by Marvin Dunn, a historian, who tried to get Charlie Crist, then attorney general and later governor of Florida, to reopen the case, but to no avail; neither was his case investigated under the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act.[3] It is frequently cited as comparable to the case of Emmett Till, who was also lynched (at age 14) for allegedly making advances at a white woman at a grocery store.[4]\nTameka Hobbs wrote about the lynching and three other lynchings in her 2015 book Democracy Abroad, Lynching at Home: Racial Violence in Florida.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "On July 16, 2011, in Port St. Lucie, Florida, Blake Hadley, 54, and Mary-Jo Hadley, 47, were murdered by Tyler Hadley, their 17-year-old son. Three years later, he was convicted of the murder, and sentenced to life in prison.\nTyler allegedly decided how he wanted to commit the murders a few weeks prior to committing them. He apparently told a friend exactly what he was planning to do at that time - noting that having a big party after a parricide had \"never been done before.\" Shortly after noon Tyler wrote on his Facebook wall, \"party at my crib tonight...maybe.\"\nAfter Tyler's parents returned home that day, he hid their phones and locked their black labrador (who he suspected would defend his parents) in a closet.\nShortly before 5:00\u00a0p.m. on the evening of July 16, 2011, Tyler took three pills of ecstasy and then stood behind his mother, Mary-Jo, as she worked on her computer in the family room. He attacked his mother with the back-end of a claw hammer first. Hearing the screams, his father rushed out of the bedroom to see what was happening. Blake saw Tyler attacking his mother and froze at the sight. Tyler then fatally attacked his father with the hammer. After killing them, he dragged their bodies into the master bedroom and spent three hours cleaning up the blood and throwing household items that reminded him of them on top of their bodies.[1][2]\nTyler first invited people to his party at 12:15 p.m. on the day of the murders, hours before he murdered his parents. He funded the party with his dead parents' credit cards (he was spotted by an ATM when his photo was taken as he pulled cash out of the accounts) and then picked up some friends. Around 60 people attended the party that night and several are alleged to have noticed \"the smell of dead bodies\".\nDuring the party, Tyler apparently told several people about what he had done. Tyler went on a short walk with a friend, Michael Mandell, and confessed his crime to him. After returning to the party, Michael discovered the bodies of Blake and Mary-Jo in the master bedroom. Michael did not leave the party immediately. He continued to spend hours with Tyler and even took a selfie with him. Four hours later, he then left the party and called a local crime hotline to report the murders. News of the crime was then spread by word of mouth. Hadley was arrested early the next morning.[2]\nTyler was 17 at the time of the murders. During his teenage years, Tyler began skipping school and taking drugs. His sentencing documents indicate he had been involved in myriad crimes prior to these murders. To wit, Tyler had participated in drug use, sales, and purchases and had been criminally detained for arson, vandalism, thefts, aggravated battery, and now murder (there was also a $15,000 civil suit pending after Tyler had hit and injured a child while driving his father's car in June 2010). Prior to the parricides, he had been enrolled in an out-patient drug treatment program (which was not working because he was not willing to stop using drugs). Knowing he would soon turn 18 - and desperate to get him help, his parents had recently found an in-patient treatment program for him - which was subsequently stated to be the motive for the murders; he did not want to be in the program - as per the resentencing documents.[3][4]\nBecause Tyler was a minor, he could not be sentenced to death by Florida law. In 2014, he was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.[5]  While in jail awaiting sentencing, Tyler had spent his time signing autographs for fellow inmates. He would take a news article about the murder and write, \"It's Hammer Time\" across the article and sign with his self-proclaimed nickname - Hammer Boy.\nIn April 2016, his sentencing was overturned by an appeal judge who stated the lower court \"did not consider the correct alternative to a life sentence\".[6] Miller v. Alabama had just recently been handed down by the Supreme Court which changed how Juvenile Murderers were to be treated within the adjudicatory process. When sentencing occurred, the Judicial Review mechanism was not in place - and Tyler was entitled to having Judicial Review at some point in the future now that the law had evolved. Although the original judge had worked hard to meet the requirements of the new law during the Sentencing Hearing, the procedure had not yet been codified - so a new Sentencing Hearing would cure both of those defects and ensure Tyler received the justice due him.\n",

        "paragraph": "Edwin Bernard Kaprat III (September 21, 1964 \u2013 April 19, 1995), known as The Granny Killer, was an American serial killer, rapist, and arsonist who committed six murders in Tampa and Hernando County, Florida from 1991 to 1993, with a majority of his victims being elderly women. Convicted for two of the killings and sentenced to death, he and another inmate were stabbed to death during a dispute in prison.[1]\nEdwin Bernard Kaprat III was born on September 21, 1964, in New York City, New York, one of two children born to refrigeration mechanic Edwin \"Skip\" Kaprat Jr. and his wife Ruth, a real estate agent. The family moved to the Great Meadows section of Independence Township, New Jersey when he was still young, and according to neighbors, they were considered to be upstanding citizens.[2] Although described as intelligent and obsessed with reading books, Kaprat, who was nicknamed \"Mike\" by family members, was also known to be a very violent and easily-angered bully who would attack those weaker and smaller than him. Due to this, his teachers resorted to giving him plush toys so he could redirect his anger to them, punching and kicking them.[2] He reportedly started drinking at age 12 and developed an addiction to alcohol, which landed him in juvenile treatment centers and juvenile courts on numerous occasions.\nAfter his 16th birthday, Kaprat dropped out of the Hackettstown High School, and in November 1982, he married his pregnant girlfriend, Nora Niederhaus.[3] Even after the birth of his two sons, Kaprat continued drinking and smoked marijuana. By that time, the Kaprat family had faced some strife, as the elder Kaprats divorced and their daughter, Ruthie, experienced marital problems with one of her husbands having threatened to torch her car.[3] Despite his hot temper, Kaprat was well-liked by his family and relatives, and was noted for his interest in the Middle Ages and Dungeons & Dragons.[4] In October 1990, he and his wife moved to his parents' home in Spring Hill, Florida, where they had planned to start a new life with their children.[3]\nOn February 22, 1991, the body of 27-year-old Lee Anthony Bugay III was found in a mangrove near the Courtney Campbell Causeway in Tampa by a man who had been sunbathing.[5] Bugay had been reported missing the previous morning, and injuries on his head indicated that he had been beaten to death with either a tire iron or a pipe.[6] His vehicle was later found at a nearby boat ramp, and investigators took plaster casts of footprints and tire tracks found near the crime scene in the hopes of finding clues that would let them catch the killer.[5]\nJust hours after Bugay's body was found, authorities were notified that someone had purchased gasoline from a Texaco store using his credit card.[4] Upon further investigation of this clue, they identified the man as Kaprat, who by then had returned to New Jersey.[7] In early March, after learning that an arrest warrant had been issued for him, Kaprat called a detective in the Hackettstown Police Department and expressed his desire to turn himself in. On March 9, Kaprat surrendered himself to authorities, and soon after extradited back to Florida to charges of first-degree murder, armed robbery and forgery.[7]\nBefore being put on trial, investigators attempted to link Kaprat with an unrelated arson attack on another man committed the day after Bugay's murder, but could not charge him due to a lack of evidence. At the trial itself, it was determined that Kaprat's confession was not overtly reliable, and he was thusly convicted on the forgery charge and dealing in stolen property. He was then placed under house arrest at his parents' home in Hernando County, but was later arrested for violating it and was imprisoned until May 7, 1993. By that time, his wife had divorced him due to his aggressive behavior towards their children and his volatile temper (which she believed was a projection of his own alleged physical abuse as a child), and he had dropped out of the Hillsborough Community College.[3] After his release, Kaprat wrote a letter to his attorney in New Jersey, alleging that his eldest son had attempted to kill his younger brother and had sexually molested his mother, but these allegations could not be substantiated.[3]\nAfter his release, Kaprat started work as a machinist at the Padgett-Swann Machinery Company, which allowed him to commute between Hudson and Spring Hill.[8]\nOn August 7, 1993, a fire broke out at the Spring Hill home of 80-year-old Sophia Francis Garrity, a retired public relations employee from New Jersey who lived by herself.[9] By the time the firemen had arrived to extinguish the flames, she had perished in the blaze. The incident came as a shock to the community, as Garrity, affectionately called \"The Cookie Lady\", was well-liked and respected by everyone.[9] The starting point of the fire was determined to be the cause of an electrical malfunction in Garrity's bedroom, with the fire being spread by her bedroom fan. Due to the circumstances, it was ruled as accidental and Garrity's death was also ruled as such.[10]\nTen days later, an elderly couple consisting of 84-year-old William \"Bill\" Whitney and his 83-year-old spouse Alice were found beaten up at their home in Spring Hill, after a neighbor had heard Bill screaming and that the couple's smoke detector had gone off.[11] Upon arriving at the scene, firefighters took care of a fire that had been set in the home, but had failed to spread quick enough before it could be put out. Both Whitneys were transported to Bayfront Health St. Petersburg, but as Bill had been severely injured and Alice suffered from Alzheimer's disease, they were unable to provide any useful testimony that could identify their assailant. This was further complicated by the apparent lack of a weapon or motive, which left the authorities at a standstill.[12]\n",

[1] The murder would be adapted into the 2001 film Bully.\nBobby Kent, the son of Iranian immigrants Fred and Farah Kent (originally surnamed Khayam),[2] attended South Broward High School in the South Florida suburb of Hollywood, Florida.[3] According to Tim Donnelly, who prosecuted all the conspirators for this murder, one attorney described Kent as \"like Eddie Haskell. All the parents loved him in the neighborhood, but the kids looked at him a different way.\"[4]\nMarty Puccio is an Italian-American, and was raised Catholic.[5] Kent and Puccio had known each other since third grade, had lived on the same block in Hollywood, Florida since that time, and were good friends as teenagers. Bad blood, however, existed between the two. Puccio felt \"ill-will and hatred\" towards Kent, who would bully and pummel him.[6]\nBoth sets of parents were wary of the friendship as well. Puccio's parents, Martin Sr. and Veronica, were concerned because Marty often returned from being with Kent bleeding or covered in bruises. Fred Kent thought of Puccio as a wayward slacker who had no future (Puccio was a high school dropout) and felt the friendship with his son would destroy the future he was helping him build. Frequent gym-goers, both boys were rumored to use steroids, which, in Kent's case, according to testimonial accounts, significantly contributed to his erratic, aggressive behavior.[citation needed]\nKent and Puccio had experimented with making gay porn movies, hoping to distribute them to local shops. Neither Kent nor Puccio actually participated in these movies, but, rather, allegedly directed them and coaxed a Florida man in his 40s to perform on camera. Kent tried to peddle a movie, titled Rough Boys, to porn shops across South Florida. None took him up on the offer, due to the poor audio and video quality as well as the lack of any sexual activities in the film beyond the man dancing nude and playing with a dildo.[7]\nToward the beginning of 1993, Puccio (aged 20) began dating Lisa Connelly (aged 18). Frustrated by how much time Puccio spent with Kent (aged 20) as well as Kent's treatment of Puccio, Connelly tried to distract Kent from Puccio by setting up her friend Alice \"Ali\" Willis (aged 17) with Kent.[8] Kent and Willis dated for a few weeks, but she ultimately ended the relationship because he was abusive.[9] In June, Puccio confided to Connelly that Kent had been abusive to him quite often over the years. Connelly tried to convince him to end the friendship, but Puccio seemed hesitant. By this time, Connelly knew she was pregnant with Puccio's child, and was determined to pursue a permanent relationship with him.[10]\nAllegedly, Connelly decided that Kent needed to be eliminated permanently, and began talking to Puccio and other friends about murdering him.[11] On July 13, 1993, Connelly called Willis and told her that \"Bobby Kent was planning to come to Palm Bay, Florida, where Willis was living, to murder her and smother her baby [by a previous relationship], unless she returned to Broward County to date him again.\"[12] Willis claimed Connelly asked her to come to Connelly's house to discuss murdering Bobby Kent. Willis went to Connelly's house and brought two friends, her current boyfriend, Donald Semenec (aged 17), and Heather Swallers (aged 18).[13]\nOn the night of July 13, 1993, Puccio, Semenec, Swallers, Connelly and Willis met with Kent. Puccio, Semenec, and Swallers became uncomfortable and left. Connelly and Willis lured Kent to a new development under construction with the promise that he would be able to drive Willis' Mustang 5.0 and have sex with her.[14] Connelly had brought along her mother's pistol, intending to kill Kent while he was distracted by sexual activity with Willis, but was unable to go through with shooting him.[15]\nDespite the failed attempt, Connelly still wanted Kent dead. Seeking assistance, she contacted a self-proclaimed hitman named Derek Kaufman (aged 20), who had been recommended by a friend of Willis'. The group met Kaufman at his home in Rolling Oaks, Florida.[16] They wanted him to get a gun so they could kill Kent that night, but Kaufman told them he couldn't procure a weapon that quickly. Willis, Connelly, Semenec and Swallers then went back to Connelly's house and were joined by her cousin, Derek Dzvirko (aged 19).[17] The group continued to discuss their plans, and ultimately decided to go ahead with murdering Kent the next night, with Kaufman's assistance.[18]\n",

He was killed by an assassin, whose likely target was President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the assassin shot Cermak instead after a bystander hit the assassin with a purse.\nAnton Joseph Cermak was born to a mining family in Kladno, Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic), the son of Anton\u00edn \u010cerm\u00e1k and Kate\u0159ina n\u00e9e Frank(ov\u00e1).[2][3][4]\nHe emigrated with his parents to the United States in 1874, and  grew up in the town of Braidwood, Illinois, where he was educated before beginning to work full time while still a teenager.[5] He followed his father into coal mining, and labored at mines in Will and Grundy counties.[6] After moving to Chicago at age 16, Cermak worked as a tow boy for the horse-drawn streetcar line,[7][a] and then tended horses in the stables of Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood.[6] During the early years of his working life, Cermak supplemented his education with evening high school and business college classes.[8]\nAfter saving enough money to buy his own horse and cart, he went into business selling firewood, and he subsequently expanded his venture into a haulage business.[8] As he became more politically active, Cermak served in municipal government jobs, including as a clerk in the city police court, and as a bailiff for the Municipal Court of Chicago.[9][10] As his political fortunes began to rise, Cermak was able to avail himself of other business opportunities, including interests in real estate, insurance, and banking.[8]\nHe began his political career as a Democratic Party precinct captain, and in 1902, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives. Seven years later, he became alderman of the 12th Ward (serving two terms: one from 1909 through 1912, and another from 1919 through 1922).[11] Cermak was elected President of the Cook County Board of Commissioners in 1922, chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party in 1928, and mayor of Chicago in 1931.[12]\nIn 1928, he ran for the United States Senate, but was defeated by Republican Otis F. Glenn, after Cermak received only 46% of the vote.\nCermak's mayoral victory came in the wake of the Great Depression, the deep resentment many Chicagoans had of Prohibition, and the increasing violence resulting from organized crime's control of Chicago\u2014typified by the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.[citation needed]\nThe many ethnic groups, such as Czechs, Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, Italians, and African Americans, that began to settle in Chicago in the early 1900s were mostly detached from the political system, due in part to a lack of organization, which led to underrepresentation in the City Council. As an immigrant himself, Cermak recognized Chicago\u2019s relatively new immigrants as a significant population of disenfranchised voters, which had the potential to be a large power base for Cermak and his local Democratic organization.[citation needed]\n",

She and her mother, Ana Blanco,[7] moved to Medell\u00edn when she was three years old. Upon arriving there, she adopted a criminal lifestyle. Blanco's former lover, Charles Cosby, recounted that at the age of 11 she allegedly kidnapped, attempted to ransom and eventually shot a child from an upscale flatland neighborhood near her own neighborhood.[1][8][9] Blanco had become a pickpocket before she even turned 13. To escape the sexual assaults of her mother's boyfriend, she ran away from home at the age of 19 and resorted to looting in Medell\u00edn until the age of 20.[1][8]\nBlanco was a figure in the drug trade from Colombia to Miami, New York and California.\nIn the mid-1970s, she illegally immigrated to the United States with false passports and settled in Queens, New York. She established a sizable cocaine business there and in April 1975, she was indicted on federal drug conspiracy charges along with 30 of her subordinates. She fled to Colombia before she could be arrested, but returned to the United States and settled in Miami in the late 1980s.[citation needed]\nHer return more or less coincided with the beginning of very public violent conflicts that involved hundreds of murders and killings yearly which were associated with the high crime epidemic that swept the City of Miami in the 1980s. The struggle by law enforcement to put an end to the influx of cocaine into Miami led to the creation of CENTAC 26 (Central Tactical Unit), a joint operation between the Miami-Dade Police Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) anti-drug operation.[10][11]\nBlanco was involved in the drug-related violence known as the Miami Drug War or the Cocaine Cowboy Wars that plagued Miami in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

He was the younger brother of writer Ernest Hemingway and wrote six books, including a first novel entitled The Sound of the Trumpet (1953), based on Leicester's experiences in France and Germany during World War II.\nIn 1961, Leicester published My Brother, Ernest Hemingway,[2] a biography. The work was well-received and brought Leicester both recognition as a writer in his own right and significant financial rewards. With the capital from the work, Hemingway created the micronation of New Atlantis on a raft off the coast of Jamaica,[3] intended to serve as a marine research headquarters. The project was cut short when New Atlantis was destroyed in a 1966 tropical storm.[4][5]\nHemingway was born in Oak Park, Illinois, to Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and Grace Hall Hemingway, a musician. He was the youngest of six siblings, the others being Marcelline (1898 - 1963), Ernest (1899 - 1961), Ursula (1902 - 1966), Madelaine (1904 - 1995), and Carol (1911 - 2002).\nHemingway married twice.

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

He was a member of the Presidential anti-drug task force in South Florida.\nAriel Rios was born in New York City to Puerto Rican parents.  He graduated from William Howard Taft High School in February 1972, and immediately enrolled in John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan and received his B.S. in Criminal Justice in 1976. He married his high school sweetheart, Elsie Morales, immediately upon graduation. Rios started working as a guard with the Washington, D.C., and New York City Department of Corrections; he worked his way up to the Internal Affairs Unit. He then joined the ATF and took the oath of office on December 3, 1978. He completed his formal training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia, in 1979. After training, he was assigned to the New Haven office on June 3, 1979.\nOn December 2, 1982, as part of the Presidential anti-drug task force in South Florida, Special Agent Rios and his partner, Alexander D'Atri, were sent into a \"buy and bust\" undercover operation to negotiate a large cocaine deal from suspected drug traffickers. The meeting took place at the Hurricane Motel on West Flagler Street, Miami. The operation was going well until one of the suspects, standing by the window, noticed other agents closing in. When he pulled a gun, Rios moved forward in an attempt to disarm the man and save his fellow agents. While struggling with the drug dealer, he was shot in the face and died on the scene; his partner was seriously wounded. Rios was survived by his wife and two children. He was buried in Jayuya, Puerto Rico.\nCitizens of Miami donated $23,000 to the Ariel Rios Memorial Fund. President Ronald Reagan invited the Rios and D'Atri families to the White House for a special tribute. The Secretary of the Treasury presented medals to Elsie Rios and Alexander D'Atri.\nOn April 20, 1983, the district court sentenced Augustin D. Alvarez and Mario C. Simon to life plus 50 years in federal prison, for the first-degree murder of the federal agent Ariel Rios and assault against federal officer Alexander D'Atri, cocaine conspiracy and distribution of cocaine, and using of a firearm during the commission of a felony; Oscar Hernandez to 30 years in prison; Victoriano Concepcion to 25 years in prison; and Eduardo Portal to 22 years in prison. Two other men were sentenced for lesser charges.\nOn February 5, 1985, the block-long federal building at 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., that used to house the ATF Headquarters was renamed the Ariel Rios Federal Building in his honor.  It now houses the United States Environmental Protection Agency headquarters. In May 2013, the building was renamed the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building for former President Bill Clinton.[1]\nThe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) headquarters is now located at 99 New York Avenue NE in Washington, DC.  In 2013, the ATF honored the memory of Special Agent Ariel Rios by naming the reflecting pool the Ariel Rios Reflecting Pool in accordance with the wishes of the family.[2][3]  In December 2016, this ATF Headquarters building was renamed the Ariel Rios Federal Building in his honor.\nIn 2003, a stretch of 49th Avenue from Flagler Street to 8th Street SW was renamed Special Agent Ariel Rios Ave. (M Res. 02-633) by the City of Miami.\n",

        "paragraph": "The lynching of Leander Shaw occurred near midnight on July 29, 1908, in Pensacola, Florida. Shaw was accused of the attempted murder and rape of 21-year-old Lillie Davis. Shaw, being positively identified by Davis, was arrested and taken to jail. On the night of July 29, an angry mob shot the Escambia County Sheriff and hung Leander Shaw in Plaza Ferdinand VII.[1][2]\nEarlier on July 29, 1908, 21-year-old Lillie Davis was beaten and found, a victim of assault in her Gull Point home. Davis' husband absent at the time, the assailant raped her, slit her throat, beat her in the head with a Colt revolver he\u2019d stolen from the home, and then fled. Davis' daughter had also been struck. Davis was taken to a nearby hospital.[3][4][5]\nTwo hours later, a sheriff\u2019s deputy arrested Leander Shaw near the bridge over Bayou Texar, \u201crealizing in an instant he had caught the negro brute.\u201d The still-bloody knife and stolen revolver were reportedly found on Shaw. Shaw was taken to the hospital Davis was being treated at, where she recognized Shaw in an instant as the man responsible for the assault. Shaw was taken into custody and was held at the county jail. Lillie Davis died three days later, on August 1.[3][4]\nBy 7:00 p.m., a crowd began to form outside of the Escambia County Jail. Sheriff of Escambia County James C. Van Pelt, after unsuccessfully trying to convince the mob to disperse, was quoted by the Pensacola News Journal:\nGentlemen, here I am. You can kill me if you want to, but if you get my prisoner, it will be over my dead body. I have sworn to do my duty, and I am going to do it if I die for it!At 8:45, the mob stormed the jail, using a section of the streetcar rail to break down the jail yard gate. There was a volley from the second story windows of the jail building, where several deputies were stationed. Sheriff Van Pelt talked for thirty minutes before him and his deputies opened fire on the mob. A firefight began, several men on both sides being injured. Two people died, including \"Bud\" Nichols, a member of the mob who was shot in the head, and street car conductor Henry C. Kellum, who was shot in the heart accidentally, when the revolver of Sheriff Van Pelt was discharged while in his pocket.[4][3][5]\nAt about 11:30, about a dozen members of the mob scaled the rear wall of the jail and entered the backyard. Proceeding quietly, while the officers were busily engaged with the mob in front, the dozen men leaped upon them, kept a number of them to the floor, while others kept deputies at gunpoint. Keys to the jail were taken from Deputy Cusachs. The mob took Shaws, attached a noose to his neck, and dragged him through east on Zarragossa street to Tarragona, before taking him to Plaza Ferdinand VII, where the crowd attached the rope to an electric pole, hung him, and shot his body with more than 500 bullets. In the final attack, H. C. Kellum was also killed. It is believed that Kellum received his death wound when a group of four or five men were engaged in overpowering Van Pelt.[4][3][5][6]\n",

Nine of their children were home at the time, but were not hurt by the intruders.[1] The family's attorney said that the safe contained jewelry, family papers, and prescription medications.[3]\nByrd Starling Billings divorced his second wife Cynthia Reeve Billings in January 1993.[4] Four months later, he married his third wife, Melanie Anne Billings (n\u00e9e Brock).[4][5] Melanie Billings had two biological children from previous relationships, Ashley Markham[6][7] and Nicole \"Nikki\" Billings (died in 2008).[6][8][9] Melanie was 17 years old when she gave birth to Ashley and 19 years old when she gave birth to Nikki.[7]\nByrd Billings reportedly had two biological children also (not with Melanie Billings).[10]\nThey had a total of 16 children, including each other's stepchildren and adoptive children.[11][12][nb 1] One source said 13 of the children were adopted.[15] Before the couple's murder, three of their adopted children, many of whom had special needs, had died.[10]\nAt the time of their death, Melanie Billings owned a used car lot and Byrd Billings had a company named Worldco Financial Services.[5][16] Byrd Billings was also a used car dealer and former strip club owner.[5][17]\nSeven men were charged with first-degree murder and home invasion robbery, and an eighth suspect was charged with being an accessory after the fact.[13]\nIn October 2010, Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr. was on trial for first-degree murder facing a possible death sentence in Escambia County Circuit Court in Pensacola.[18] The Billings had 16 cameras located around the residence to help them observe their children, and some of the video footage was shown in court.[18] Gonzalez was identified in one video by Frederick Thornton, one of his accomplices, as the person who shot Byrd Billings.[18]\nOn February 17, 2011, it was announced that Gonzalez was to be sentenced to death for the first-degree murders. On April 10, 2014, Gonzalez's conviction and sentence of death were affirmed on direct appeal by the Florida Supreme Court.[19]\nA total of eight people were convicted for planning and participating in the crimes.

He was later fatally shot by two witnesses while cycling away from the scene.\nBrown was born on November 26, 1930 in Chicago, Illinois. He joined the U.S. Navy and was honorably discharged in 1954. People later stated that Brown always kept a military bearing about himself and was quite militaristic. In 1955, he moved from Chicago to Florida,[1] where he graduated from the University of Miami in 1957 and in 1964 from East Carolina College in Greenville, North Carolina, earning a master's degree in education. After working briefly for Keyes Realty, he got a full-time job as history teacher at Hialeah Junior High School in 1962[1] and moonlighted at Miami-Dade Community College as an accounting instructor from 1964 to 1970.\nBrown was married twice and had three children. His first wife died and his second marriage failed, according to his second wife, Sylvia, because he refused to seek psychological help. As a consequence, his condition began to deteriorate, resulting in an increasingly disheveled and gaunt appearance, and, though once being a rather gregarious person, he began isolating himself more and more. A neighbor later described him looking \"as if he were 80 years old\". Reportedly, one of his daughters once tried to have him hospitalized, though as his admission had to be voluntary, her request was declined. Additionally, his career began to suffer. At Hialeah Junior High, Brown was an alleged bigot who hated everyone,[2][3] and was transferred to Drew Middle School, a school with a black majority, in 1981. There he taught American history until March 3, 1982, when he was relieved of his teaching duties for medical leave to treat his psychiatric problems.\nThough neighbors described Brown as a quiet, kind and helpful man, who was working hard to keep his duplex neat and clean, and praising him overall as a landlord, it was also said that he made a habit of walking into other people's yards early in the morning, waking them by yelling \"United States!\" and that during the night, shots were heard from his house. It was also reported that he once broke a window when firing a pellet gun, and picked grapefruit from a neighbor's tree wearing only his underwear. Apparently, he also collected aluminum cans.\nAfter a trip abroad, which he had taken shortly before the shooting, he came back in worse shape than before and stated that nothing in the United States stood for anything.[2][3]\nWhile Brown wrote in his application for a job as a teacher in 1961 that he \"always enjoyed being with younger people\" and felt that he \"could benefit these younger people with his abilities\", his work began to suffer as his psychological problems aggravated over the years. Being seen as a competent teacher for a long time, more and more complaints were filed against him as his condition worsened. Students began to refuse to sit in his class as he rambled incoherently about his personal problems and topics unrelated to his curriculum and conducted confusing conversations where he strung together completely unrelated things. Students would often take advantage of this by asking him a question that resulted in him talking for the rest of the period.[2] On one occasion, on May 5, 1977, Brown sent three girls to detention because they refused to sit in his class, as they were \"sick and tired of hearing him talk.\" He was also known to be very prejudiced, to make threatening remarks, and to insult people of other races.\nDuring his time at Hialeah Junior High, Brown wrote a letter to the principal for \"the enlightenment of the assistant principals,\" discussing the misbehavior of his students in rambling and poorly constructed sentences. \"I don't read the students their rights as infants, you all do\u00a0... If you ever study business law, until a child is 18, the child can do just about anything the child desires to do and get away with the abuse. Any adult interfering, is accountable as an adult, but with infancy laws, the child is a child.\"\nIn the summer of 1981, Brown was transferred to Drew Middle School. There, on December 3, he had a dispute with two students, whom he accused of throwing books. During the argument, Brown described his sexual behavior with a girlfriend and chased the boys with a stapler. The school board's director of personnel control, Pat Gray, described this as \"a classroom incident\u00a0... wherein Mr. Brown demonstrated a significant lack of adult judgment, an overtone of sexual fixation, and definitive aggression toward students.\" The school's principal wrote: \"I found Mr. Brown to be incoherent and unable to grasp the severity of the situation at hand. I, also, fear for the safety of the students since during my conference with Mr. Brown he demonstrated no regret for his actions pointing to the fact that he is a 'man' and any man would have reacted in the same manner.\"\nPrincipal Octavio Visiedo wrote in his last evaluation of Brown: \"I find Mr. Brown to be a negative force. Today I did a follow-up observation of Mr. Brown's second-period class and I continue to be alarmed about the potential for disaster in that class. As you can see, from today's observation, there is absolutely no discipline or control in that class and I am concerned for the safety of the students and also Mr. Brown.\" Further, he stated that Brown's class was in \"total and complete chaos\", with students talking constantly, wandering about at will, and leaving without permission.\n",

On December 12, 1970, when Spencer was called up to play with the Leafs in what would be his first NHL game on television, he telephoned his father Roy in British Columbia to tell him to watch the game that night on Hockey Night in Canada. Spencer was to be interviewed between periods of the game. However, a game featuring the Vancouver Canucks versus the California Golden Seals was aired instead. Infuriated, Roy Spencer drove 135 kilometres (84\u00a0mi) to Prince George, where the closest TV station, CKPG-TV (then a CBC Television affiliate), is located. When he arrived, he ordered station staff, at gunpoint, to broadcast the Maple Leafs game instead. The station complied, but as Roy Spencer left the station, he was confronted by the RCMP. After a brief stand-off Roy Spencer was shot and killed.[2][3]\nAfter several seasons with Toronto and the New York Islanders, Spencer was acquired by the Buffalo Sabres. Spencer had his best offensive production in a Sabres uniform when he scored 41 points (12 goals, 29 assists) in 1974\u201375. Spencer played well in Buffalo and was extremely popular with the fans at Buffalo's Memorial Auditorium. His hustle, aggressive play, and hitting ability were things the fans admired.  Spencer developed into a solid two-way player. He would however be dealt to the Pittsburgh Penguins in September 1977.\nHis offensive production declined as he took on the role of a checking forward with the Penguins. Spencer's last NHL season came in 1978\u201379 when he played seven games for Pittsburgh. He then finished his playing career in the AHL (Binghamton, Springfield and Hershey) and retired after the 1979\u201380 season.\nAfter hockey, Spencer submerged himself in a life of alcohol and violence. In 1987, he was charged with kidnapping and murder and faced the death penalty.[4] Family and friends, including ex-teammates, gathered around him and tried to help. A former teammate from the Sabres, Rick Martin, tried to help by testifying as a character witness at his trial. The jury returned a not guilty verdict in March 1988 and Spencer vowed to change his life. Despite the acquittal and a move to Florida, Spencer's life continued to spiral out of control. Three months later, Spencer would die under similar circumstances to his father; he was fatally shot in a robbery following a crack cocaine purchase in Riviera Beach, Florida.\nSpencer was survived by five children from two marriages, and his twin brother, Byron.\nA book on Brian's life Gross Misconduct: The Life of Spinner Spencer, written by Martin O'Malley, was adapted in 1993 by Paul Gross and directed by  Atom Egoyan into a made-for-television film in Canada, Gross Misconduct: The Life of Brian Spencer.\nIn 1999, Spencer's daughter and grandson were killed in a car accident in Oklahoma.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn the morning of December 6, 2019, a terrorist attack occurred at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida.[3][4][5] The assailant killed three men and injured eight others.[6][7][8] The shooter was killed by Escambia County sheriff deputies after they arrived at the scene.[9] He was identified as Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, an aviation student from Saudi Arabia.[10][11]\nThe FBI investigated the case as a presumed terrorism incident, while searching for the motive behind the attack.[12] On January 13, 2020, the Department of Justice said they had officially classified the incident as an act of terrorism, motivated by \"jihadist ideology.\"[5][4]\nOn February 2, 2020, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the shooting. In an audio recording, emir of the Yemen-based group Qasim al-Raymi said they directed Alshamrani to carry out the attack.[13] On May 18, 2020, the FBI corroborated the claims.[14]\nAlshamrani, a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force, was participating in a training program sponsored by the Pentagon as part of a security cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia.[15]  A United States Department of Defense official said more than 850 Saudi nationals are in the U.S. participating in the training program, which includes English, basic aviation, and initial pilot training.[10]\nSaudi Arabia is one of many countries allied to the United States that send members of their military to the naval station for training.[9] At the time of the shooting, the program hosted 5,180 students from 153 countries, including the perpetrator.[16]\nPrior to the attack, at 6:39\u00a0a.m. a message on Twitter was posted by a user using the handle @M7MD_SHAMRANI, which declared hate for Americans due to its support of Israel. This message has not yet been verified as being posted by the perpetrator.[17]\nThe shooting began at 6:43am[18] and was first reported at 6:51\u00a0a.m. when the suspect, armed with a 9mm Glock handgun and several extra magazines,[19] opened fire in one of the classroom buildings.[20] During the incident he moved through two floors of the building, discharging his weapon on both.[21] One of the victims was able to make his way away from the scene to alert the first response team of the location of the shooter amongst other details.[22] The suspect was shot and killed at 6:58am[18] after two deputies from the Escambia County Sheriff's Office and members of the base security force exchanged gunfire with him.[9][23]\nThe outside of the building was videotaped by another Saudi Arabian student while the shooting was occurring, as two additional Saudi Arabian students watched the shooting from a car.[24] The student who was filming, and the other two students, had attended a dinner party hosted by the perpetrator prior to the attack.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn February 14, 2018, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Miami suburban town of Parkland, Florida, murdering 17 people[note 2] and injuring 17 others.[2][3][4] Cruz, a former student at the school, fled the scene on foot by blending in with other students, and was arrested without incident approximately one hour later in nearby Coral Springs.[5] Police and prosecutors investigated \"a pattern of disciplinary issues and unnerving behavior\".[6]\nThe killing spree is the deadliest high school shooting in United States history, surpassing the Columbine High School massacre that killed 15, including the perpetrators, in Colorado in April 1999. The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

        "paragraph": "Alfred Warner Hair (1941-1971), also Freddy Hair,[1] was an American painter from Fort Pierce, Florida who, along with Harold Newton, was instrumental in founding the Florida Highwaymen artist movement.[2][3] Hair was the leader of a loose-knit group of prolific African American painters who sold their vibrantly colorful landscapes from the trunks of cars along the eastern coastal roads of South Florida. In 2004, Hair was inducted into Florida Artists Hall of Fame.[4]\nAlfred Warner Hair was born 20 May 1941 in Fort Pierce, Florida, one of seven children of Samuel and Annie Mae Hair.[2] Hair graduated from Lincoln Park Academy in 1961, and attended one year at community college before dropping out to pursue his career as an artist.[5]\nHair's artistic talent had been noticed by his high school art teacher Zanobia Jefferson and she introduced him to the prominent Florida landscape artist, A. E. Backus. Backus had been encouraging several young African American artists and persuading them to paint landscapes rather than religious motifs.[6] In 1956, when Hair was 14 years old, he began taking painting lessons from Backus. After three years, Hair set out on his own to earn a living as an artist. Because of Jim Crow era racism, art galleries in Florida would not represent African American artists, forcing Hair to find other m\nethods of selling his artwork. Following the example of Backus' former student Harold Newton, Hair peddled his landscape paintings door-to-door from the trunk of his car.\nHair and Newton inspired a loose-knit group of 26 African American artists to follow their leads. While Newton is recognized by fellow artists for his technical inspiration, Hair is considered the leader and catalyst \"who set the tone for the group through the 1960s.\"[6][7] He gathered a group of a \"young, energetic\" artists who painted large quantities of brilliantly colorful impressionistic landscapes.[6]\nHair created dozens of paintings at a time. He later hired friends to drive along the highways, selling his paintings door-to-door for $20 or $25. According to fellow members of the Highwaymen, Hair had vowed that his art would make him a millionaire by the time he was 35 years old.[7]\nIn 1970, Hair was killed in a barroom brawl at age 29 and the prodigious output of the movement's artists began to wane.[7]\nHair \"eschew[ed] any formal color theory and rel[ied] on instinct and intuition to depict [a] steady stream of beaches, palm trees and Everglades scenes. Organic colors were not their main focus; they wanted to wow buyers with burnt-orange Florida skies or unnaturally florescent clouds.\"[2] Hair worked on dozens of canvasses at once. According to visual arts professor Gary Monroe, \"He would tack up 20 boards at a time outdoors, then quickly lay down the color without sketches, as fast as he could, going from board to board, painting parts of sky, a tree or some other element. The essence of his paintings was spontaneity, bold colors, palm trees, surf, sand and incredible skies. 'Painting fast was a prerequisite, not a deterrent to Hair's art,' Mr. Monroe writes. 'He simply \"threw paint\" on his boards to miraculously achieve images that are more about being alive than about the manipulation of plastic values.' \"[6]\nHair signed his original works \"A. Hair.\" Several dozen paintings produced in 1966 and 1967 were signed \"Freddy.\"[1] According to his widow, the Freddy paintings were collaborative works in which she painted the backgrounds and Hair completed all of the detail work.[1]\nHair was married to Doretha Hair (later Truesdell) and he had five children.[8] On 9 August 1970, Hair was shot to death during a barroom dispute.[2][7]\n",

In 1987 he was convicted by a Florida court for the double murders of Chinese Jamaican businessmen Derrick Moo Young and Duane Moo Young, and was sentenced to death. Maharaj has always denied committing the murders, and according to the human rights organisation Reprieve, the case of Krishna Maharaj is \"an epic miscarriage of justice\".[2]\nOn 13 September 2019, Federal Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-Reyes made a legal finding that Maharaj had proven his innocence by \"clear and convincing evidence\" and that \"no reasonable juror could convict him\", but ruled that this was not sufficient for Maharaj to be set free.[3]\nMaharaj is of Indo-Trinidadian descent and is the brother of Ramesh Maharaj, former Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago. He is also the brother of Indra Rambachan (n\u00e9e Maharaj), who is the wife of National Award-winner lawyer Roopnarine Rambachan.\nAccording to the prosecution, in December 1986[4] Maharaj arranged a false meeting with Derrick Moo Young in the DuPont Plaza Hotel, in order to demand of Moo Young to repay money that he had fraudulently taken from Maharaj's relatives in Trinidad. Derrick Moo Young turned up at room 1215 together with his son Duane. Once inside the room, Maharaj is said to have appeared with a gun from behind a door. An argument resulted, and the father, Derrick Moo Young, was allegedly shot to death by Maharaj. The prosecution stated that the son, Duane, was then taken upstairs in the suite and shot by Maharaj.\nIn 1997, a Florida court overturned the death sentence.[5] In 2001, almost 300 British politicians, church leaders and judges wrote a letter to the then Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, asking for a retrial. The letter stated that there were \"astonishing flaws\" in the case against Maharaj. Among those signing the letter were Lord Goldsmith, then Attorney General for England and Wales and Northern Ireland, Lynda Clark, then Advocate General for Scotland, Charles Kennedy, then Leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ken Livingstone, then Mayor of London, and Nicholas Lyell, former Attorney General for England and Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe governor denied him a retrial; Maharaj was instead re-sentenced to life imprisonment in 2002.[5]\nIn 2006, the British human rights organisation Reprieve made an appeal to Governor Jeb Bush for clemency on Maharaj's behalf, pointing out that the jury had heard from none of Maharaj's alibi witnesses, who would have put him 25 miles away at the time of the murder; that the prosecution's star witness had changed his story several times; and that evidence had emerged since the trial that the murder victims were involved in money laundering and had links to drug traffickers, and that there were a number of alternative suspects with strong motives, which had not been considered at the time.[5]\nThe appeal was denied.\nIn 2008, Reprieve made a second appeal for clemency to the then Governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, but this appeal was also denied.[2]\n",

Conahan was convicted of one murder, but has been linked to a dozen murders, mostly of transients seeking employment and gay men in the Charlotte County, Florida area in what came to be known as the Hog Trail Murders.\nConahan was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, and moved with his family to Punta Gorda, Florida, shortly after birth. When he was a teenager, he discovered he was homosexual; this displeased his parents, who sent him to several psychiatrists. He graduated Miami Norland High School in 1973 and joined the United States Navy in 1977, stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois. In 1978, he was nearly court-martialed for taking fellow Naval officers off base for sex, and was discharged a few months later after getting into a fight with a man upon whom he had attempted to force oral sex.[2]\nAfter his Navy discharge, Conahan stayed in Chicago for 13 years before moving back to Punta Gorda to live with his elderly parents in 1993. In 1995, he became a licensed practical nurse, graduating at the top of his class from Charlotte Vocational-Technical Center.[2] He was employed by Charlotte Regional Medical Center in Punta Gorda.[citation needed]\nOn February 1, 1994, the mutilated corpse of a man was discovered in Punta Gorda. The body had been outside for about a month and had rope burns on the skin and the genitalia had been removed and discarded. The man was not identified[3] until 2021, when the Charlotte County Sheriff's Office announced that new DNA testing confirmed the victim as Gerald (Jerry) Lombard, of Lowell, Massachusetts.[4][5]\nOn January 1, 1996, a North Port family's dog brought home a male human skull. Police eventually pieced together much of a skeleton and determined that the genitalia had been cut out, similar to the 1994 victim (Lombard). The North Port skeleton has not been identified.[6]\nA third man's mutilated body was discovered in North Port on March 7, 1996. He had been killed only 10 days earlier.[7] He also remained unidentified until June 1999, when he was identified as John William Melaragno.[8]\nAnother man's skull was found in Charlotte County on April 17, 1996. Police searched the surrounding woods and found the rest of the man as well as a second body. The second was a man who had been raped, murdered, and mutilated only the day before, and was identified as Richard Allen Montgomery.[9][10][11] The first body was later identified as Kenneth Lee Smith.[12][13] Speculation became rampant about a serial killer, and the media dubbed the murders \"The Hog Trail Killings\", named for the wooded areas in which the bodies of the victims were found.[13]\nFacial reconstruction of (previously) unidentified victim, known as John Doe #1; DNA tests in 2021 confirm identity as Gerald (Jerry) Lombard.\nIn May 1996, a few witnesses directed police to Daniel Conahan, including one who had escaped him when Conahan's car became stuck while driving him down a dirt road.[14] Later, police linked Conahan to a 1994 Fort Myers police report where Stanley Burden had been propositioned, tied to a tree, and nearly strangled. Burden survived and had rope scars on his body two years later.[15]\n",

The gunman, identified as Scott Paul Beierle, shot six women, two of them fatally, and pistol-whipped a man before killing himself.[2][3]\nCriminal investigators attested to the attacker's hatred of women. The US Secret Service and International Centre for Counter-Terrorism consider the attack an act of misogynist terrorism.[4][5]\nScott Paul Beierle entered the hot yoga studio at 5:37\u00a0p.m. EDT on November 2, 2018, shooting six people, resulting in the deaths of two women, Maura Binkley, 21, and Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, 61.[2] Officers responded to reports of gunfire within three and a half minutes, at which point the perpetrator was found deceased.[6] Partygoers in a bar across the street told reporters how they witnessed people fleeing from the studio and that a man in a bloody white T-shirt who ran into the bar claimed to have charged the shooter only to be pistol whipped.[7] This claim was later backed up in interviews with survivors who stated that the male customer used a vacuum cleaner and then a broomstick to attack Beierle, which gave other students time to escape. Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo also credited the students who \"fought back and tried not only to save themselves but other people\".[8]\nThe yoga studio was a part of a plaza that is occupied by restaurants and other businesses. Those eating at the restaurant underneath the studio heard the gunshots and told reporters that the owner came through the dining area shortly after, asking if anyone was a doctor.[9]\nWhen officers arrived, it was discovered that six people had been shot during the attack. Two victims, Maura Binkley and Nancy Van Vessem, were deceased at the scene.[10] Maura Binkley, age 21, was a student at Florida State University, and due to graduate in 2019.[11] Dr. Nancy Van Vessem, age 61, was a doctor and the chief medical director for Capital Health Plan. She was also a faculty member at Florida State.[12]\nScott Paul Beierle (October 6, 1978 \u2013 November 2, 2018)[13] was later revealed as the perpetrator by police. According to his social media profiles on Facebook and LinkedIn, Beierle was a military veteran and former teacher for the Anne Arundel County Public School System in Maryland, teaching both English and social studies at Meade High School and being affiliated with conservative groups FSU College Republicans and We Are Conservatives.[14][15][16] Additionally, Beierle has also taught at numerous other schools as a substitute teacher, yet only briefly due to performance issues and inappropriate behavior. In one instance, Beierle was fired for an incident where he reportedly asked a female student if she was \"ticklish\", while touching her \"below the bra line\" on her stomach.[17] He had been charged twice for battery, in 2012 and 2016, where he was accused of grabbing a woman's buttocks in both situations.[18]\nYouTube videos posted by Beierle in 2014 showed that he identified with the involuntary celibate community while often complaining about  his sexual rejections from women.[19] He also sympathized with the shooter behind the 2014 Isla Vista killings, Elliot Rodger, as he too felt lonely and unloved as well as posting misogynistic songs on SoundCloud. Other videos depicted him ranting about African-Americans, illegal immigration and interracial relationships.[20][21][22] One of the videos was named \"Dangers of Diversity\".[23]\nThe FBI and the Tallahassee Police Department attested to Beierle's hatred of women, saying he was \"disturbed\" during the shooting.  They further noted he had planned the attack months in advance.[24] The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism lists the attack as an act of misogynist terrorism.[5]\n",

He supported Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election,[13] endorsing Trump's ideas about immigration, the Trump wall, and Trump's \"America First\" approach.[8] Kashuv was initially guided by conservative commentators Ben Shapiro and Guy Benson.[14] Kashuv has also worked for Ron DeSantis' campaign for the 2018 Florida gubernatorial election.[14][15] By March 2018, Kashuv was in the process of producing a mobile phone application, ReachOut, which aims to let students who have emotional struggles to ask for help.[5][16] In April 2018, Kashuv criticized CNN for being biased because one of their contributors, Joan Walsh, had liked a tweet by Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter died in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[17] In July 2018, Kashuv gave a speech at the 2018 National Western Conservative Summit.[18] Kashuv also gave a speech in April 2019 at the yearly meeting of the National Rifle Association (NRA).[19]\nThe Miami Herald in July 2018 wrote that the conservative Second Amendment supporter Kashuv had \"gained a national following as a counterweight to the March For Our Lives\" movement.[14] Associated Press in February 2019 described Kashuv as \"the most prominent conservative voice among the students\" who had survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.[15] As of June 2019, Kashuv has amassed over 300,000 followers on Twitter.[20]\nKashuv became director of high school outreach of the conservative[14] group Turning Point USA and gave speeches about gun rights, including at Princeton University.[21] Kashuv invited Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk to address Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, but the school did not permit the activity.[22] Kashuv helped to plan the organization's 2018 High School Leadership Summit for over 800 students, and was lauded by Fox News in July 2018 as \"a role model for young conservatives across the country\".[23] That month, Kirk described Kashuv as a \"a national spokesperson for one of the most controversial and divisive issues of our time\", and as \"probably the most hated pro-gun advocate at the time besides Dana Loesch\", a spokesperson of the NRA.[14][18]\nHe resigned from Turning Point in May 2019,[24] hours after former classmates threatened to make public screenshots of racist remarks Kashuv had made.[25][26] Kashuv denied that his resignation was related to his racist remarks.[6]\nFollowing the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Michael Gruen, a 19-year old \"influencer marketer\", noticed Kashuv's posts on Twitter and approached him offering to help him get his message out. With the help of conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, and former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, meetings on Capitol Hill were set up for Kashuv in March 2018. The trip was mostly planned on short notice, with Kashuv reacting: \"I never really wanted to get into politics.\"[7][8] During his visit, Kashuv met with President Trump and his wife Melania Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, two Democratic senators (Chris Murphy and Chuck Schumer), three Republican senators (Orrin Hatch, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz), Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, and CNN's Jim Acosta.[5][8]\n",

        "paragraph": "Tiffany Ann Cole (born December 3, 1981) is an American convicted murderer who was found guilty of the kidnapping and first-degree murder of a Duval County, Florida husband and wife and sentenced to death. Also found guilty in the case were three men: Alan Wade; Bruce Nixon; and Cole's boyfriend, Michael Jackson. Prosecutors said Cole and the three men developed a plan to kidnap and kill the couple to steal their money, and dug a grave for them in Charlton County, Georgia, two days before knocking on their door and asking to use the phone.[1] As of February 2015, Cole is the third youngest woman on death row in the United States;[2] she was 26 at the time of her conviction.\nTiffany Cole was a familiar face to Carol and Reggie Sumner since her family had been neighbors to the 61-year-old couple in South Carolina. When the Sumners moved to Jacksonville, Florida, in March 2005, they sold a car to Cole. Cole agreed to make monthly payments and often drove to Jacksonville with friends.\nIn June 2005, Cole and her new boyfriend, Michael James Jackson,[3] drove to Jacksonville to complete the paperwork on the car. While there, they stayed at the Sumner home. While staying with the couple, Jackson began hatching a plan to rob the couple and steal money from their bank accounts.[4]\nIn early July 2005, Tiffany Cole, Michael Jackson, and two other men, Alan Wade and Bruce Nixon, drove to the Sumners' home. Wade and Nixon went to the door and asked to use the phone. Once inside, Wade and Nixon attacked. The Sumners were bound and gagged with duct tape, put into the trunk of their Lincoln Town Car, and driven across the border to a remote part of Georgia. Cole and Jackson traveled separately in their car, planning to get deliberately pulled over for speeding if the police got too close to the Lincoln. Once in Georgia, the Sumners were forced to reveal the personal identification numbers of their bank accounts. The couple, blindfolded and bound, was pushed into a pre-dug grave and buried alive by Wade and Nixon.[5][6]\nCole subsequently pawned jewelry and other items stolen from the Sumners' home,[7] and the ATM card was used to obtain more than $1000 in cash. Three of the group were tracked back to a hotel in South Carolina by the use of the ATM card and arrested there. After being arrested Nixon willingly led police to the Sumners' grave, revealing that both victims had managed to free themselves of their bonds, but could only manage to hug each other in their final moments before they died.[citation needed]\nAt Cole's week-long trial in October 2007, the jury deliberated for less than 90 minutes before finding her guilty of first-degree murder.[8] They voted 9-3 that she should receive the death penalty.[5] Evidence included photos of Cole and two co-defendants in a limousine, celebrating with champagne and handfuls of cash.\nFive months later, a judge handed down two death sentences for the murders, and a sentence of life in prison for the kidnappings. She awaits execution at Lowell Correctional Institution Annex.[9]\nCole is one of three women currently on Florida's death row, the others being Margaret Allen and Tina Brown, each sentenced to death in unrelated murders.[10][11]\nWade and Jackson also received death sentences. Nixon, who had led police to the bodies and testified against the others, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 45 years in prison.\n",

        "paragraph": "The National School Walkout was a national student-led protest on April 20, 2018, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre.[1] The walkout was one of many protests against gun violence in the United States that erupted in response to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas mass shooting on February 14, 2018.\nAfter the shooting in Parkland, Ridgefield High School student Lane Murdock uploaded a petition to change.org, asking people to protest the lack of responses that follow school shootings in America by participating in a walkout. The petition accumulated over 270,000 signatures.[2][3][4] Murdock and fellow Ridgefield students Paul Kim, Max Cumming, and Grant Yaun partnered with Indivisible to successfully rollout the effort.[5][1]\nThe National School Walkout's Twitter account accumulated more than 100,000 followers in five days.[6] National School Walkout scheduled the nation wide walkout to take place on April 20, as it marked the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High school shooting.[2][5] The official color for The National School Walkout was orange, as a nod to the color hunters wear to distinguish fellow hunters from animals.[6]\nThe walkout took place at 10 o\u2019clock in the morning in each local time zone. When students headed outside, they participated in 13 seconds of silence to honor the 13 people killed at Columbine High School.[2] Many walkouts consisted of the incorporation of open mics, to guest speakers and even voter registration sections; where senior students that were eligible, registered to vote.[2] Some students also wrote letters to students from other school communities that have been impacted by school shootings,[7] whereas others decided to set booths where students could call their representatives to pressure lawmakers over gun control.\nThe April 20 walkout organized by Murdock was set to last until the end of the school day, because the issue is one that needed to be \u2018'addressed [for] longer than 17 minutes\".[7] This was said in reference to the March 14 walkout, which lasted for 17 minutes to mark the 17 lives lost at the Marjory Stone High School shooting, after which students returned to their classrooms.[4]\nMurdock\u2019s plan to hold a school walkout met much criticism from different groups of people, ranging from students and staff from Columbine High school to educators of various schools and even government branches of education from different states across the country. The backlash was largely due to uncertainty about the purpose of the walkout, as well as its overlap with many standardized student exams.[8]\nNational School Walkout occurred on the anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting, but faced criticism from students, alumni and staff from the high school. It was custom for classes to be cancelled on April 24 for Columbine High School students in honor of those who passed during the shooting to allow students to engage in community service. Many members from the school community expressed their dislike of the walkout being held on that day and made it clear that they did not support it.[9] The principal from Columbine High School, Scott Christy, wrote a letter addressed to students from different high schools near the area; prompting them to partake in community service in lieu of participating in a walkout. The letter read, \"Please consider planning service projects, an activity that will somehow build up your school . . . as opposed to a walkout.\u201d[9]\nThe New York City Department of Education announced that students who were absent from school due to the walkout would be marked with an unexcused absence.[1] Other schools across the country also placed restrictions on students' ability to participate.[1] This led to some students holding alternative events after school. However, other schools compromised with students holding demonstrations before, or after school or permitting them to attend walkouts, if they had a parental note.[9]\nParkland students organized their own walkout in their community. The morning of the nationwide walkout, news broke that one person was injured in a shooting at Forest High School in Ocala, Florida.[8] This led to some students cancelling their planned walkouts, but also energized others, such as David Hogg, who expressed in a video posted on his social media that the event reiterated the necessity of the walkout.[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "James Bailey Cash Jr. (born August 2, 1932) was a five-year-old child from Princeton, Florida who was smothered to death during his kidnapping by Franklin Pierce McCall in 1938.\nMcCall successfully collected a large ransom for the dead child, having gone so far as to plant and publicly \"discover\" one of his own ransom notes, leading the authorities to detain him as a suspect. After several days of interrogation, McCall confessed to Cash's abduction and directed authorities to the hidden ransom money and the child's remains.\nDuring the 1930s, the United States experienced a series of \"ransom kidnappings\" committed explicitly for financial gain, with victims generally from either middle-class or wealthy families.[1][2] The most widely publicized ransom kidnapping at the time was the 1932 kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh Jr., the only son of the record-setting aviator Charles Lindbergh.[1][2] Like James Bailey Cash Jr., Lindbergh's son died during the abduction, but a ransom was sought nevertheless. The Lindbergh case inspired Congress to pass legislation that allowed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate kidnappings in any state under certain conditions, one of which was a ransom demand.[3] Despite this legislation, ransom kidnappings continued to be a major concern at the time when James Bailey Cash Jr. was abducted in May 1938.[4]\nOn the night of May 28, 1938, five-year-old James Bailey Cash Jr., nicknamed \"Skeegie\", was kidnapped in the middle of the night by Franklin Pierce McCall.[4] McCall was a local laborer and a former tenant of the Cash family.[5] After putting James Jr. to bed, sometime after 9:30 pm, his mother, Vera Cash locked up the house and left to meet her husband at the family-owned general store.[4] Sometime later, McCall entered the house and used a handkerchief to quiet the boy before taking him from the home, smothering him to death in the process.[6] McCall hid the boy's body about a half-mile away from his home.[4] By 10:10 PM, both parents returned home to find the boy missing and began to search the surrounding area. The search effort was later joined by neighbors and local Boy Scouts.[7][8]\nSoon after the murder, by 11:00 pm the same night, McCall began to intimidate John Emanuel and Geraldine Barnes, a local African American farming couple.[9] At first, McCall attempted to get Emanuel to speak with him and to deliver a letter to Bailey Cash, Cash Jr's father. Emanuel, however, refused and McCall threatened to shoot Emanuel before leaving.[10] The couple then left their home, to hide out at a friends home for safety.[11] Meanwhile, Beatrice Cash, a relative of John Baily Cash who lived in the same town, found a letter wrapped around the door knob on her front door, which instructed the reader to go to a specific house in Princeton's African American neighborhood where they would find further instructions.[12]\nThe note was addressed to J.B. Cash. Beatrice woke up her husband and drove over to the Cash residence to help with the search.[12] The house mentioned in the letter was the house belonging to Emanuel. By midnight the search was beginning to end, by now many of them were angry over the disappearance and by 1:00 AM, Bailey Cash and the rest of the family went over to Emanuel's house, surrounding it while Bailey and Asbury began to look for the note.[13] They soon found the note underneath the door of the house.[13] This note was the first of a series of ransom letters that the Cash family would receive.\nThe first note was composed of multiple sheets of paper with a series of demands written throughout:\nThe Cash family was to provide 10,000 dollars in various types of bills with serial numbers not in an order and deliver carry the money in a shoe box to Homestead, where they would drive along the road until they saw a flash two times, at which point they would leave the money on the roadside and continue the route. If Bailey complied, and kept the ransom secret, the note promised that John Baily Jr. would be safely returned.[14]\nBy 3:00 AM that morning, Special Agent Arthur Rutzen of the FBI had been contacted by a Dade County Sheriff, R.B. Eavanson.[15] They would meet up later at the Roberts Hotel at Miami Beach to further discuss the case. After their discussion another investigator, Samuel K. McKee, joined the case.  McKee and Rutzen went to the Cash home to continue the investigation.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Monson Motor Lodge, at 32 Avenida Menendez, Saint Augustine, Florida, was in 1964 the site of a landmark protest event of the Civil Rights Movement. The site was before that occupied by the Monson House, a 19th-century boarding house.\nThe original Monson hotel was established by Captain Anthony Vincent \"Bossy\" Monson and his wife Florence Young in the 1880s, not long before the opening of the Flagler hotels made the city a luxury destination.[1]  Monson was a Saint Augustine native raised at 56 Marine Street (now known as the Gonz\u00e1lez-Jones House). Born in 1854, he was the youngest of eight children, including William F Monson, who became a notable architect/builder in Mandarin, Florida. His mother was Laurenna Leonardy, a Minorcan descendant of the Bonelly and Leonardy families who were original colonists in Andrew Turnbull's expedition at New Smyrna, Florida. Leonardy married William Monson (Anton Bengt Osmundsen), who had immigrated to America in 1836 from Stavanger, Norway.\nThe first Monson House was on the water's edge at 24 Bay Street (now Avenida Menendez), between the Plaza and Fort Marion. An 1885 advertisement claimed rooms for ten boarders at $9-$10/week.[2] In addition to rented rooms, the Monson offered tourists a chance to sail to the Saint Augustine Lighthouse on Anastasia Island on one of four yachts anchored near the club house.\nThe visitor to St. Augustine should consider the sojourn incomplete without a sail in the harbor and over in the beach where one can climb the stairs to the top of the light-house on Anastasia Island, and get a magnificent view of the ocean on one side and the town on the other. In order to do this, it will be necessary to engage one of Captain Monson's yachts, Mamie, Maria, Traveller or Ocrenba. which are at anchor near the club-house. Captain Monson is a native of St. Augustine and about 58 years of age. He is also proprietor of a boarding house which can accommodate ten guests at $1.50 per day from $9 to $10 per week.[3]This first house burned in an 1895 fire. The second Monson House was located at 26 Bay Street next to Brava Lane. Open all year, the rates were $1.50 to $2.00 per day with $7.00 to 12.00 per week. Residents could enjoy hot and cold baths. The hotel was again enlarged in 1901 and in 1912, when the capacity was advertised at 75.\nThe final wooden hotel fell victim to the April 1914 fire that started at the Florida House and destroyed everything from Saint George Street to the Bay. The fire claimed four hotels, the opera house, the courthouse, and countless homes and businesses.[4]  The Monson was replaced by a masonry structure that opened on January 5, 1915. Monson died later that year, and his brother-in-law Charles E Young Sr became manager of the new hotel.[5]\nThe Monson was enlarged in 1916 with an addition to the south side that almost doubled its size. The Monson Hotel remained a fixture on Saint Augustine's bay front until 1960, when it was demolished and replaced by the Monson Motor Lodge. That structure was eventually razed as well, and in 2003 reopened as the Hilton Bayfront Hotel. It remains under Hilton's management today, with 72 rooms spread over 19 small buildings. During excavations prior to construction of the Hilton's underground parking garage, archeologists found evidence of colonial foundations from Saint Augustine's British Period (1763\u20131784).[6]\nIn the spring of 1964, Robert Hayling worked with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to recruit college students to come to Saint Augustine for spring break to take part in civil rights activities.  Martin Luther King Jr. of the SCLC was arrested on the steps of the Monson Motor Lodge restaurant, June 11, 1964. He wrote a \"Letter from the Saint Augustine Jail\" to his friend, Israel S. Dresner, in New Jersey, encouraging rabbis to come to Saint Augustine and take part in the movement. The result was the largest mass arrest of rabbis in American history, which occurred June 18 at the Monson.[7] That same day, black and white activists jumped into the Monson swimming pool in defiance of segregation ordinances. The manager of the hotel, James Brock, responded by pouring muriatic acid into the water to drive the \"wade in\" protestors out. Photographs of this action, and of a police officer jumping into the pool to arrest the young activists, were broadcast around the world and became some of the most famous images of the movement. On June 30, Florida Governor Farris Bryant announced the formation of a biracial committee to restore interracial communication in Saint Augustine. National SCLC leaders left Saint Augustine on July 1, the day before President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law.\nThe motel and pool were demolished in March 2003, despite five years of protests, thus eliminating one of the nation's important landmarks of the civil rights movement.[8]  The Hilton Bayfront Hotel was built on the site. Today, the steps of the Monson Motor Lodge have been preserved with a plaque to commemorate King's activism in the city.[9] The last sign from the Monson is preserved in the ACCORD Civil Rights Museum at 79 Bridge Street, the former dental office of Dr. Robert Hayling, the leader of the civil rights movement in St. Augustine. It has also been displayed at the state Capitol in Tallahassee.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn February 2, 2021, a shootout occurred between a gunman and several agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) at an apartment complex in Sunrise, Florida, United States. At the time, the agents were serving a warrant related to a child pornography case. Two FBI agents were fatally shot and three others were injured. The gunman, who was the subject of the warrant, was later found dead after barricading himself inside the apartment. The incident was one of the deadliest in the FBI's history.\nAt 6:04\u00a0a.m., FBI agents investigating a child exploitation case served a federal warrant at the Water Terrace apartment complex, located in an upscale gated community in Sunrise, 11 miles (18\u00a0km) outside of Fort Lauderdale. They were seeking a computer and other evidence for the case. The agents were being backed up by officers with the Sunrise Police Department. As the agents were about to execute the warrant, the subject of their warrant, who had reportedly seen them coming through a doorbell camera, began firing at them with a rifle. Five agents were struck, two of them fatally, prompting a massive law enforcement response, including the SWAT team from the Broward County Sheriff's Office. One of the fatally wounded agents, Daniel Alfin, managed to return fire, despite being shot multiple times. The other deceased agent, Laura Schwartzenberger, was killed instantly.[3] The gunman, who was wounded in the exchange, then barricaded himself inside the home for several hours and was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.[1][4][5][6][7][8] Witnesses calling 9-1-1 reported hearing multiple gunshots in the apartment complex.[9]\nThe shootout was the most violent incident in the FBI's history since the 1986 Miami shootout that left two agents dead and five others injured, and it was also the first time an agent was fatally shot in the line of duty since 2008.[4][5][10]\nTwo FBI agents were killed in the shootout and three others were injured. Those killed were Special Agent Daniel Alfin, 36, and Special Agent Laura Schwartzenberger, 43. Schwartzenberger had been with the FBI since 2005, and Alfin since 2009. Both of them specialized in crimes against children. Two of the injured agents, both of whom suffered multiple gunshot wounds, were in stable condition at a hospital and eventually released, while the third did not require hospitalization and was treated at the scene.[4][5][11][12]\nThe gunman, 55-year-old David Lee Huber, was also identified as the subject in the federal warrant.[2][13][14] The FBI and investigators said he was being investigated for possession of child pornography.[15] A Sunrise Police spokeswoman said the department hadn't had any prior dealings with Huber, nor were they aware of any prior concern that he was armed.[5] The department later said they had been called to his apartment three times in April 2020, twice in one day because of noise and nuisance complaints, and the third time for a \"medical run\".[14] His only interactions with law enforcement were through a series of traffic tickets and an eviction in Colorado.[15]\nHuber was born and raised in Louisiana and lived in South Florida for most of his life. He had previously lived in New York, Colorado, and Atlanta for portions of his life. He married in late 2000 and had two children, but he divorced in 2016.[15] Huber attended an unspecified college in Broward County, according to an online resume he wrote. He ran a computer troubleshooting company with his then-wife from 2004 to around 2006, then a computer consultation company from 2006 to 2011. From 2013 to 2020, he worked a series of computer-related jobs.[2] He was also a former mortgage broker.[14] A neighbor described Huber as an awkward, antisocial man who lived alone and with little furniture. He had been living in Pembroke Pines before the shooting.[15]\nA former coworker said Huber told him that he was suffering from bipolar disorder that he was taking medication for. The coworker also said Huber had been fired from his job as a systems analyst after ranting against President Donald Trump taking away his medical coverage during a company discussion on healthcare. Following the incident, employees were concerned about Huber returning and committing a workplace shooting in retaliation, which led to the company organizing escorts and allowing some employees to bring their firearms into the office.[16]\nPresident Joe Biden reacted to the shootout, saying his \"heart aches\" for the deceased agents.[17] FBI Director Christopher A. Wray praised the two deceased agents in a statement and also said the FBI \"will be forever grateful for their bravery.\" The FBI Agents Association offered condolences to the injured and said the two agents' deaths were \"devastating to the entire FBI community and to our country.\"[4][5]\n",

In an audio recording, emir of the Yemen-based group Qasim al-Raymi said they directed Alshamrani to carry out the attack.[13] On May 18, 2020, the FBI corroborated the claims.[14]\nAlshamrani, a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force, was participating in a training program sponsored by the Pentagon as part of a security cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia.[15]  A United States Department of Defense official said more than 850 Saudi nationals are in the U.S. participating in the training program, which includes English, basic aviation, and initial pilot training.[10]\nSaudi Arabia is one of many countries allied to the United States that send members of their military to the naval station for training.[9] At the time of the shooting, the program hosted 5,180 students from 153 countries, including the perpetrator.[16]\nPrior to the attack, at 6:39\u00a0a.m. a message on Twitter was posted by a user using the handle @M7MD_SHAMRANI, which declared hate for Americans due to its support of Israel. This message has not yet been verified as being posted by the perpetrator.[17]\nThe shooting began at 6:43am[18] and was first reported at 6:51\u00a0a.m. when the suspect, armed with a 9mm Glock handgun and several extra magazines,[19] opened fire in one of the classroom buildings.[20] During the incident he moved through two floors of the building, discharging his weapon on both.[21] One of the victims was able to make his way away from the scene to alert the first response team of the location of the shooter amongst other details.[22] The suspect was shot and killed at 6:58am[18] after two deputies from the Escambia County Sheriff's Office and members of the base security force exchanged gunfire with him.[9][23]\nThe outside of the building was videotaped by another Saudi Arabian student while the shooting was occurring, as two additional Saudi Arabian students watched the shooting from a car.[24] The student who was filming, and the other two students, had attended a dinner party hosted by the perpetrator prior to the attack.[16]\n",

A native of Toronto, he earned a J.D. degree from Harvard in 2001 and after working briefly as a law clerk and junior associate at a law firm, joined the faculty of Florida State University in 2005.\nMarkel was murdered in Tallahassee, Florida, in 2014, in a murder for hire motivated by child custody issues following Markel's divorce from Wendi Adelson, a clinical law professor and child advocate also employed at Florida State University at the time.[1][2][3] Wendi Adelson has not been charged,[4] but she has been named, together with her brother Charlie and mother Donna, as \"conspirators\" in the killing. So far, four individuals have been charged: Luis Rivera pled guilty to murder, and was sentenced to 19 years in jail. Sigfredo Garcia was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, and sentenced to life in prison. Katherine Magbanua was found guilty of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation of murder, in a retrial following a mistrial in her original case, and was sentenced to life in prison plus two consecutive 30-year sentences.[5] Charlie Adelson (Wendi Adelson's brother) has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation of murder, but has not yet been tried. Jury selection will begin April 24, 2023, and evidence will be heard May 1.

The shooting came at a period of heightened public support for gun control that followed mass shootings in Paradise, Nevada, and in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in October and November 2017.\nStudents at Parkland founded Never Again MSD, an advocacy group that lobbies for gun control. On March 9, Governor Rick Scott signed a bill that implemented new restrictions to Florida's gun laws and also allowed for the arming of teachers who were properly trained and the hiring of school resource officers.[7][8]\nThe Broward County Sheriff's Office received widespread criticism for its handling of the police response, both for not following up on multiple warnings about Cruz despite a lengthy record of threatening behavior and for staying outside the school instead of immediately confronting him.[9] This led to the resignations of several police officers who responded to the scene, and the removal of Sheriff Scott Israel.[9] A commission appointed by then-Governor Scott to investigate the shooting condemned the police inaction and urged school districts across the state to adopt greater measures of security.[9][10]\nOn October 20, 2021, Cruz pleaded guilty to all charges and apologized for his crimes. The prosecution sought the death penalty, and a four-month death penalty trial was expected to commence in January 2022.[11] After suffering numerous delays, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial commenced on July 18, 2022.[12][13] On October 13, 2022, a jury unanimously agreed that Cruz was eligible for the death penalty, but deadlocked on whether it should be imposed, resulting in a recommendation to sentence him to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.[14] On November 2, 2022, Cruz was sentenced to life without parole, in accordance with a Florida law requiring the court not to depart from the jury's recommendation.[15][16]\nThe shooting took place during the afternoon of February 14, 2018, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, an affluent suburb about 30 miles (48\u00a0km) northwest of Fort Lauderdale and 45 miles (72\u00a0km) northwest of Miami.[17][18] The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, was dropped off at the school by an Uber driver[19] at 2:19\u00a0p.m.,[20] 20 minutes before dismissal time.[21][22] According to a police report, Cruz was carrying a rifle case[23] and a backpack.[24] He was spotted and recognized by a staff member who radioed a colleague that he was walking \"purposefully\" toward Building 12.[25][26] However, he did not pursue the shooter or call a \"Code Red\" to lock down the school.[27] The first staff member later claimed that his training called for only reporting threats; his colleague hid in a closet.[28]\nCruz entered Building 12,[note 3] a three-story structure containing 30 classrooms typically occupied by about 900 students and 30 teachers.[29] Armed with an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle[note 4] and multiple magazines,[32] Cruz entered a hallway and began firing indiscriminately at students and teachers.[30][33][34] A fire alarm went off (either pulled by Cruz or activated by smoke from the gunfire), causing confusion because there had been a fire drill earlier in the day.[35] Cruz first killed three students in the hallway, then fired through the windows of four closed classroom doors, killing six more students and wounding thirteen others.[21][29] Students were unable to seek shelter at \"hard corners\"\u2014areas of a classroom that people could safely hide at if a gunman peered through the window of a door\u2014because many of the classrooms in Building 12 lacked one, and furniture otherwise obstructed potential safe spaces.[21] Two of those killed were students in Ivy Schamis' Holocaust History class; Schamis was teaching a class lesson on combating hate when Cruz fired shots into her classroom.[36][37][38][39] Around five students from Schamis' class were injured.[37][38] According to Schamis, Cruz was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he had scrawled swastikas onto the ammunition magazines that he left at the school.[37][38]\nAs the shooting unfolded, a \"Code Red\" was still not called due to confusion among school employees over who had the authority to do so.[21] At about 2:21\u00a0p.m., a staff member eventually activated a lockdown, but only after discovering the body of a victim and hearing gunfire.[25][21][40] An armed school resource officer of the Broward County Sheriff's Office was on campus when the shooting broke out, and he remained outside between Building 12 and the adjacent Building 7.[41]\n",

Accounts differ about how the conflict began and who fired first, but Long shot and killed Wynne, and wounded another man, L. G. Harris, who accompanied him. Long escaped, but surrendered to authorities two days later.\nIn the meantime, a posse was organized by the sheriff. The posse shot and killed Jim Dennis, a friend of Long. The sheriff said he was resisting arrest. Relatives and friends of Long were rounded up and taken to jail for allegedly helping him escape; they were Bert and Mary Dennis, Long's wife Stella Young, and two friends of Dennis, Andrew McHenry and Reverend Josh Baskin. A mob of 200[1] took them from the jail the morning of August 18 and hanged them from a single oak tree, one mile from Newberry; newspapers called it \"a lynching bee.\"[2][3] The tree no longer exists, but it was at the intersection of Newberry Lane and Alachua County Route 235.[4]  So many African\u2013Americans gathered when the news of the lynchings reached them that whites were afraid of a \"race war\u201d.[5]\nNo arrests were ever made. The Ocala Evening Star reported a rumor that the coroner's jury had returned a verdict that the six lynching victims had died in freak accidents, such as running into a barbed wire fence and bleeding to death, or falling out of a tree and choking to death or breaking their necks.[6] Archivist Rebecca Fitzsimmons at the Matheson History Museum has noted that legal documents pertaining to the lynchings have not been found.[7]\nLong was tried on September 7, found guilty after an all-white jury deliberated seven minutes, and sentenced to hang.[8] He was executed in the yard of the Alachua County jail on October 27, 1916. A man who had voiced an opinion approving the killing of Wynne was forced to leave town.[9]\nAccording to historian Patricia Hilliard-Nunn, as many as nine people may have been lynched or shot to death during the events.[10] The Alachua County Historical Commission presented research in 2018 that concluded at least 43 lynchings took place in Alachua County in the 18th and 19th centuries.[11]\nIn 2019, a marker was unveiled in remembrance of the lynchings and to acknowledge the black men and women who were murdered.[12]\nCoordinates: 29\u00b039\u203205\u2033N 82\u00b035\u203253\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff29.6513\u00b0N 82.5980\u00b0W\ufeff / 29.6513; -82.5980\n",

Antinori was regarded as the first boss of the Tampa crime family, later known as the Trafficante crime family.\nAlthough much of his early life is unknown, Antinori was one of the first mobsters to emerge in Florida during the Prohibition era. By the 1930s, Antinori was one of the largest heroin traffickers in the country, with close ties to French-Corsican heroin traffickers and American mafia bosses. Antinori established a drug pipeline from Marseille, France through Cuba into Tampa, Florida.  According to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, the drugs were subsequently distributed in the Midwestern United States, primarily through St. Louis mobster Thomas Buffa and Kansas City mobsters Nicola Impastato, James DeSimone and Joseph Deluca.\nLaw enforcement soon began to concentrate on Antinori's operation. In addition, mobsters such as Florida mobster Santo Trafficante Sr. soon set up rival smuggling rings. Antinori was eventually eclipsed by Trafficante, who held his own strong connections to Mangano crime family boss Vincent Mangano and Profaci crime family boss Joseph Profaci in New York.\nOn October 23, 1940, Ignacio Antinori was sipping coffee at the Palm Garden Inn in Tampa with a friend and a young female companion. Suddenly, a gunman appeared and fired two shotgun blasts at Antinori, blowing off the back of his head. The gunman was allegedly sent by one of Antinori's dissatisfied customers, the Chicago Outfit criminal organization. Antinori had sent the Outfit a poor quality shipment of narcotics. When the Outfit complained, Antinori refused a refund. At that point, the Outfit put a murder contract on Antinori.\n",

Chris Tabron mixed the song at Rumours Studios in New York City, and was assisted by Peter Geiser. The track was mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York.[1] In an interview with iHeartRadio, MNDR explained that the song is about \"celebrating life, dancing, individuality, differences, fierceness, and sometimes 'Swerlk' is even a shoulder to cry on\". She further said that it \"is not only a dance floor anthem, but it is a way of life, a mindset, and a show of solidarity.\"[2] MNDR conceived the song in honor of the one-year anniversary of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.[3] Its title is a combination of the words \"twerk\", \"twirl\", \"werk\", \"swerve\" and \"swirl\".[4]\n\"Swerlk\" marked the first single in five years by Scissor Sisters after they went on indefinite hiatus in 2012.[5] Babydaddy explained that when MNDR approached the band about the song, they all agreed that \"it was too important to refuse\".

The project was later joined by GLAAD as an additional partner, which was \"excited to be able to add an uplifting and fun message to what is also such a serious time for our community\".[6]\n\"Swerlk\" was announced as a charity single during the Pride Month of June, in view of the one-year anniversary of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.[7] It was released on June 9, 2017, through WonderSound Records on iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, and Google Play.

        "paragraph": "Leon Davis, Jr. (born December 14, 1977)[1] is an American murderer and arsonist who murdered five people over the span of seven days in Polk County, Florida, in December 2007. He was sentenced to death in two separate trials and is currently awaiting execution at Union Correctional Institution.\nDavis was born on December 14, 1977, in Lake Wales, Florida. Early friends of Davis described him as someone funny, enjoyed four-wheeling, and was an avid listener of country music.[2] Davis was also regarded as a good athlete due to him being 6 foot 5 and a high school basketball player.[2] Despite this, Davis often got into fights, which led to police detaining him, though Davis did not get charged with any crime. \nIn 2002, when Davis was 24, he and his girlfriend were arrested after leaving Walmart with about $50 of unpaid products. In July 2006, Davis purchased a home that left him over $196,000 in debt.[2] It was later found after his arrest for the murder that in January 2007, Davis wrote on his blog, \"I have hurt people in the past and I'm sorry for it! So 2007 and on I will live my life the right way, and that's keeping it real with my family and friends!\".[3] The following month, Davis married his longtime girlfriend Victoria Campo.[2]\nOn December 7, 2007, Davis entered a gas station alongside Interstate 4 in Polk County, where 33-year-old Pravinkumar Patel and 55-year-old Dashrath Patel were working.[4] Once inside, Davis brandished his gun and shot both men in close-range execution-style shootings, ultimately killing both.[5][4] Afterwards he did not steal any money, but fled the scene. The murders were caught on camera and Davis himself; however, Davis was not questioned in the days afterward.\nOn December 13, 2007, Davis entered the Headley Nationwide Insurance office in Lake Wales, which was run by 26-year-old Yvonne Bustamante, whom Davis knew, and 23-year-old Juanita \"Jane\" Luciano, who was 5\u00bd months pregnant with a baby boy whom she was going to name Michael.[2] Once inside, Davis forced both into the backroom where he forced them to unlock the safe, which contained around $900. Next, he bound both to chairs with duct tape, doused both with gasoline, and lit them ablaze. Reportedly, the fire burned through the tape, temporarily setting the women free, but by the time police arrived, both were in critical condition.[4]\nBustamante and Luciano had to be hospitalized, but Bustamante died from her injuries on December 18. Luciano, too succumbed to her injuries on January 8, along with her unborn child.[6] Before she died, she positively identified Davis as the assailant. Afterward, Davis became one of Florida's most wanted suspects, but it was short-lived as he turned himself in on December 14, Davis' 30th birthday. Besides the identification, Davis was also tied to the crime scene based on bullets and ballistics left at the scene. The bullets and ballistics also linked Davis to the previous murders on December 7.[7] Davis' murders were described as the worst killing spree in Polk County history.[8]\nThe first trial began in early 2010. During the trial, the prosecution brought forward a witness who was an emergency technician at the time. The EMT testified that one of the victims, Bustamante, told him shortly before she died that Leon Davis was her attacker. However, because this story could not be confirmed because the victim was dead, it became impossible for the defense to cross-examine. Due to this, the judge announced a mistrial.[9][10] After the mistrial was announced, Richard Bustamante, the father of victim Yvonne Bustamante, attempted to attack Davis but was ultimately apprehended. At the same time, Bustamante's mother Ebelia Rodriguez, threw her purse at Davis, hitting his lawyer Andrea Norgard.[9] Richard was not charged with the attack, but he was prohibited from being present at any future court proceedings.[10]\nA new trial was brought forward in 2011. At the end of the trial, Davis was found guilty, and a jury voted for him to be sentenced to death on April 29, 2011, for the three murders.[6] He was also given an additional life sentence for killing Luciano's unborn child.[4] Davis was due to stand on the first day of his second trial on April 16, 2012. However, due to issues with Davis's lawyers and the prosecutors, the second trial would be postponed until September 10.[11] The second trial began in September, and at the end, the court sentenced Davis to death a second time.[5] In 2016, Davis attempted to appeal, but his sentences were upheld by the Florida Supreme Court.[4][12]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJerry Michael \"Mike\" Williams (October 16, 1969[2] \u2013 December 16, 2000) was an American murder victim. Initially, it was said he left his home in Tallahassee, Florida, United States, to go duck hunting. After subsequent investigations, he was presumed to have drowned in Lake Seminole, a large reservoir located in the southwest corner of Georgia along its border with Florida; investigators later came to suspect he had been the victim of foul play, possibly at another location.[3] His body was found in October 2017 near Tallahassee,[4] and Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) officials confirmed Williams was a victim of homicide.[5]\nAfter Williams's boat was found abandoned on the lake, the initial theory was that he had fallen out of it after a collision. However, a lengthy and exhaustive search of the lake bed in the area failed to find his body: at that time, it was the only known occasion when no remains or body had been discovered after a drowning death in the lake.[6] It was eventually concluded that his body had been eaten by alligators. After waders and a jacket containing Williams's hunting license were found in the lake six months later, he was declared legally dead, following a court petition by his widow, Denise. She went on to marry Brian Winchester, a mutual friend who had helped her take out a large life insurance policy on Williams shortly before his disappearance.\nSome investigators felt aspects of the case were not consistent with the alligator theory. After years of pressure from Williams's mother, Cheryl, the case was reopened in 2004 by the FDLE. By then, officers had learned that alligators do not, in fact, eat during the winter months, as the water is too cold, and as such, it was suspected that foul play might have occurred. But it did not produce any new evidence, as the potential crime scene had not been secured during the search for Williams.\nCheryl Williams wrote letters daily to the governor, asking him to have the state reopen the investigation even though two later investigations were likewise unable to uncover any significant new information, alienating many of the law enforcement officials she had previously persuaded to reopen it.[7][8] The Investigation Discovery channel series Disappeared devoted an episode to the case in 2012.[9] In 2016, Winchester was arrested on charges stemming from an incident where he allegedly kidnapped Denise, the missing man's widow, who was now divorcing him;[10] he was sentenced to 20 years in prison on the day before the FDLE announced that Williams's body had been found. In May 2018, Denise Williams was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and accessory.[11] She was found guilty that December, after Winchester testified to shooting Michael at Denise's behest when their original plan to stage a boating accident failed, and was sentenced to life in prison in January of 2019.[12] In 2020, a Florida appellate court overturned her murder conviction but upheld her murder conspiracy conviction, for which she will serve 30 years.\nJerry Michael Williams was known as Michael or Mike. He grew up in Bradfordville[6] (north of Tallahassee), the son of a Greyhound bus driver[3] and a day care provider who raised him and his older brother Nick in a double-wide trailer. Instead of building a house, the parents saved their money so both boys, who helped by working nights at supermarkets, could attend North Florida Christian High School. There Mike excelled, serving as student council president, playing football and being active in the Key Club. At the age of 15, he began duck hunting as a hobby, and also came to know fellow student Denise Merrell.[13]\nAfter North Florida Christian, he attended Florida State University, where he majored in political science and urban planning.[14] Before graduation, he was hired by Ketcham Appraisal Group as a property appraiser. He distinguished himself as \"the hardest-working man I ever saw\", according to the company's owner. After he married Merrell in 1994, he would often go home for dinner and return to work after she (and later, his daughter as well) went to bed, and he sometimes went into work after going duck hunting in the morning.[13] According to his mother, Mike was making US$200,000 annually by the time of his disappearance.[15] He and Denise had bought a home in a small upscale subdivision on the east side of the city.[2]\nIn 1999, Williams's only child, a daughter, was born. His coworkers said he was as devoted to her as he was to his work. The following year his father died. Midway through the year, the couple bought a $1 million life insurance policy on him through Brian Winchester,[6] a childhood acquaintance of Merrell who had also become best friends with her husband. Later that year, Williams told his mother, whom he had been consoling, that he would have liked to have $50,000 to take the next year off.[3]\nTwo days before his disappearance, Mike and Denise told his mother, as well as his brother Nick, that they were planning to have another child soon. In 2001, she said, they were planning to go on a cruise in Hawaii that spring; later in the year he expected to travel to Jamaica for work as well.[13]\n",

The name \"Bet Shira\" (House of Song) was selected to reflect the upbeat and dynamic character of the founders.[3] In May 1988, the Letty Roth Synagogue Complex was dedicated as was the Arin Stacey Appplebaum Sanctuary.[4][5]\nIn January 1990, Mark Kula, a graduate of the Cantor Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City, became Bet Shira's new cantor.[6]  In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew badly damaged the synagogue.[7][8]\nIn 2005, the synagogue was serving 500 families.[4]  That year, Sam Rosen of Bet Shira Congregation was chosen as co-winner of the Jewish community's Teacher of the Year, Excellence in Teaching Award by the Center for the Advancement of Jewish Education.[9]  In 2007, the synagogue acquired a Torah scroll that during World War II had been smuggled out of the Polish town of Tarn\u00f3w, when it was invaded by Nazis and its Jewish population destroyed, and protected by monks in a monastery near Kiev until the Soviet Union collapsed.[10]\nBet Shira holds an annual \"Mitzvah day\" every year, where volunteers, and members engage in activities such as: Beautification of community sites, planting trees at homes of the disabled and elderly as part of a \"Treemendous Miami\" project; blood drives; and many clothing, food, toy and medical supply drives to benefit the Miami community.[11][12][13]\nThe synagogue's Early Childhood Center was also a site of \"Project Kavod\", a three-year pilot program in improving the culture of employment in early childhood, by the Coalition for the Advancement of Jewish Education, which was launched in 2004.[14][15]\nFor the holiday of Sukkot, Bet Shira erects what is believed to be the first and only drive-through Sukkah,[16] a tent in the parking lot of the synagogue that it calls the \"McBet Shira Sukkah\", allowing the community to participate in the celebration of the holiday from the convenience of their cars.[17][18] Members of the public can drive into the sukkah, park, lower their car window, and say the blessings for the holiday, including shaking a lulav and an etrog, as volunteers hand them snacks at the end of their visit.[17]  The idea, put into effect first in 2009, is credited to Cantor Mark Kula, who noted that cars are \"integral\" to people's lifestyles.[16] He explained that \u201cWe sit as we drive; this way, we can sit in our cars in the Sukkah.\" He also commented that \"Perhaps realizing the fragility of the Sukkah will encourage us to drive more carefully.\u201d[19][20]\nDavid H. Auerbach was the founding rabbi of the synagogue. He is from Montreal, Canada, and had served as rabbi of Ahavat Achim synagogue in Atlanta, Georgia, and then senior rabbi of Beth David Congregation in Miami prior to the founding of Bet Shira. Since his retirement in 2005, he served as the rabbi emeritus of the synagogue, until his passing in September 2016. In 2005, Rabbi Auerbach was followed as rabbi by Micah Caplan,[21] until 2010.  In July 2010, Brian Schuldenfrei assumed the post of senior rabbi.  Schuldenfrei had been associate rabbi at Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, California.[22]\nMark Kula, brother of Rabbi Irwin Kula, assumed the post of cantor in 1989. Mark and his father Morton Kula are the only father and son that have been ordained as cantors by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York. Prior to coming to Miami, Mark was the assistant cantor of New York\u2019s Park Avenue Synagogue. In 2013 Mark was appointed the Rabbi of the congregation and served as Rabbi until 2018.\n",

        "paragraph": "The Groveland Four (or the Groveland Boys) were four African American men, Ernest Thomas, Charles Greenlee, Samuel Shepherd, and Walter Irvin. In July 1949, the four were accused of raping a white woman and severely beating her husband in Lake County, Florida. The oldest, Thomas, tried to elude capture and was killed that month. The others were put on trial. Shepard and Irvin received death sentences, and Greenlee was sentenced to life in prison. The events of the case led to serious questions about the arrests, allegedly coerced confessions and mistreatment, and the unusual sentencing following their convictions. Their incarceration was exacerbated by their systemic and unlawful treatment\u2014including the death of Shepherd, and the near-fatal shooting of Irvin. Greenlee was paroled in 1962 and Irvin in 1968. All four were posthumously exonerated by the state of Florida in 2021.\nThomas, Shepherd, Irvin, and Greenlee (then 16) were accused of raping 17-year-old Norma Padgett and assaulting her husband on July 16, 1949, in Groveland, Lake County, Florida.[1]\nOn July 26, 1949, Thomas fled and was killed by a sheriff's posse of 1,000 white men, who shot him over 400 times while he allegedly fled after being found asleep under a tree in southern Madison County.[2][3] Greenlee, Shepherd, and Irvin were arrested. They were beaten to coerce confessions, but Irvin refused to confess. The three survivors were convicted at trial by an all-white jury. Greenlee was sentenced to life in prison because he was only 16 at the time of the alleged crime; the other two were sentenced to death.\nIn 1949, Harry T. Moore, the executive director of the Florida NAACP, organized a campaign against the wrongful conviction of the three African Americans. Two years later, the case of two defendants reached the Supreme Court of the United States on appeal, with special counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund Thurgood Marshall as their defense counsel. In 1951, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered a retrial after hearing the appeals of Shepherd and Irvin. It ruled they had not received a fair trial because no evidence had been presented, because of excessive adverse publicity, as well as because black people had been excluded from the jury. The court overturned the convictions and remanded the case to the lower court for a new trial.\nIn November 1951, Sheriff Willis V. McCall of Lake County, Florida shot Irvin and Shepherd while they were in his custody and handcuffed together. McCall claimed they had tried to escape while he was transporting them from Raiford State Prison back to the county seat of Tavares for the new trial. Shepherd died on the spot; Irvin survived and later told FBI investigators that McCall had shot them in cold blood and that his deputy, Yates, had also shot him in an attempt to kill him.[4] Harry Moore called for the Governor of Florida to suspend McCall. On Christmas Night 1951, a bomb went off below Moore's house, fatally wounding both him and his wife; he died that night and his wife followed nine days later. The bombers were never caught.\nAt the second trial, Irvin was represented by Marshall and again convicted by an all-white jury and sentenced to death. In 1955, his death sentence was commuted to life in prison by recently elected Governor LeRoy Collins. He was paroled in 1968, but died the next year in Lake County, purportedly of natural causes.[4] Greenlee was paroled in 1962 and lived with his family until he died in 2012. In 2016, the City of Groveland and Lake County each apologized to survivors of the four men for the injustice against them. On April 18, 2017, a resolution of the Florida House of Representatives requested that all four men be exonerated.[5] The Florida Senate quickly passed a similar resolution; lawmakers called on Governor Rick Scott to officially pardon the men. On January 11, 2019, the Florida Board of Executive Clemency voted to pardon the Groveland Four.[6] Newly elected Governor Ron DeSantis subsequently did so. On November 22, 2021, Judge Heidi Davis granted the state's motion to posthumously exonerate the men.[7]\nCharles L. Greenlee (born 4 June 1933, Florida),[8] was the son of Thomas H. and Emma Greenlee, who were born in Georgia and Alabama, respectively.[9] His family was living in Columbia County when he was two,[10] but they had moved to Baker County by the time Charles was 12.[9] His father worked in turpentine manufacturing in 1935[10] and later as a laborer, likely also in the timber industry. In 1945, Charles and four of his siblings were all in school.[9] Greenlee had come to Groveland in July 1949 looking for work, as he was already married and his wife was pregnant.[11]\nWalter Lee Irvin (born 8 May 1927, Gainesville, Florida), was living in Groveland when he registered for the draft in May 1945. He listed his mother Ellia Irvin as next of kin. He was working at the time for Apshawa Groves. He was recorded as 5'3\" and weighing 105 pounds, and was described in his registration as \"light brown\", with brown eyes and black hair.[12] He served in the Army, leaving with the rank of private.\nSamuel Shepherd (born 7 April 1927) was born in Fitzgerald, Georgia[13] to Henry Shepherd and his wife Charlie M (Robinson) Shepherd, both of Georgia. His father was working in the lumber industry.[14] The Shepherd family moved to Groveland, Florida, where his father achieved ownership of his own farm by clearing and developing former swamp land.[15] When Samuel Shepherd registered for the draft in 1945, he was described as 5'8\", 149 pounds, with a light brown complexion, brown eyes and black hair.[13] He gave his father Henry Shepherd as next of kin.[13] Shepherd and Irvin were friends and fellow veterans after World War II.[15]\n",

On July 1, 1948, he was elected president of Cuba as a member of the Partido Aut\u00e9ntico.[2]  Pr\u00edo was assisted by Chief of the Armed Forces General Genobebo P\u00e9rez D\u00e1mera and Colonel Jos\u00e9 Luis Chinea Cardenas, who had previously been in charge of the Province of Santa Clara.\nThe eight years under Grau and Pr\u00edo, were, according to Charles Ameringer,\n[...] unique in Cuban history. They were a time of constitutional order and political freedom. They were not 'golden years' by any means, but in two elections (1944 and 1948), Cubans had the opportunity to express their desire for a rule of civil liberties, primacy of Cuban culture, and achievement of economic independence. If there were sharp contradictions in Cuban society under the Aut\u00e9nticos, the circumstances differed only in degree from the complexities and dynamics encountered in free societies everywhere (how often did Cubans compare Havana with Chicago?).[3]\nPr\u00edo, called el presidente cordial (\"the cordial president\"), was committed to a rule marked by civility, primarily in its respect for freedom of expression. Several public-works projects and the establishment of a National Bank and Tribunal of Accounts count among his successes.\nHowever, violence among political factions and reports of theft and self-enrichment in the government ranks marred Pr\u00edo's term. The Pr\u00edo administration increasingly came to be perceived by the public as ineffectual in the face of violence and corruption, much as the Grau administration before it.\nWith elections scheduled for the middle of 1952, rumors surfaced of a planned military coup by long-shot presidential contender Fulgencio Batista. Pr\u00edo, seeing no constitutional basis to act, did not do so. The rumors proved to be true. On March 10, 1952, Batista and his collaborators seized military and police commands throughout the country and occupied major radio and TV stations. Batista assumed power when Pr\u00edo, failing to mount a resistance, boarded a plane and went into exile.\nAccording to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., Pr\u00edo later said of his presidency:\nThey say that I was a terrible president of Cuba. That may be true. But I was the best president Cuba ever had.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "Palm Bay is a city in Brevard County, Florida, United States. The city's population was 119,760 at the 2020 United States Census,[5] making it the most populous city in the county and the largest by land mass. The historic section of the city lies on the mouth of the Turkey Creek and the Palm Bay. Palm Bay has historically expanded south and to the west. The newer section is mostly situated west of Interstate 95 and south of the Tillman Canal.[6]\nPalm Bay is a principal city[7] of the Palm Bay\u2212Melbourne\u2212Titusville Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 606,612 at the 2020 census.[5]\nThe Ais people, attracted to the mouth of Turkey Creek at the Indian River by freshwater springs, fish, oysters, and wildlife, are thought to have been the first inhabitants in the Palm Bay area.\nThe earliest place names for this area on early maps of the late 1700s were Turkey Creek, Elbow Creek and Crane Creek. An 1870 map of the Indian River by John Andrew Bostrom shows the area void of any settlements within about 15 miles of Turkey Creek. The first prominent European-American settler was John Tillman in the late 1870s. Tillman's wharf marked the mouth of Turkey Creek at what became known as Palm Bay on the Indian River.[8]\nBy the late 1880s, Tillman was operating a profitable orange and banana grove on the north shore of the creek. He had the most notable banana grove on the Indian River. Tillman's wharf also attracted settlers, as it was a steamboat stop.[8]\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, there was a lumber operation,[clarification needed] orange groves, and packing house. Growth was slow until the arrival of the railroad in 1894. Then goods were brought in and produce was shipped to market faster. \nBetween 1910 and 1914, a land company known as the Indian River Catholic Colony became established at Tillman. Attempting to grow two crops a season, farmers quickly depleted the soil, and the colony failed. Those remaining built St. Joseph's Church on Miller Street, the oldest building still standing.\nIn the 1920s, the city was renamed as Palm Bay, after the bay bordered with sabal palm trees known as Palm Bay, located at the mouth of Turkey Creek.[8] A group of Tillman businessmen established the Melbourne-Tillman Drainage District, and issued $1.5 million worth of bonds. Starting in 1922, a 180 miles (290\u00a0km) grid of 80 canals was dug to drain 40,000 acres (160\u00a0km2) of swampy land west of Palm Bay for other uses. The canals made it possible to control flooding and redevelop marsh lands to agricultural use. These actions had the unintended consequences of leaving the land more vulnerable to flooding from storms and destroying important habitats for complex ecology.\nFarmers planted citrus groves and truck farms which shipped winter produce by the Florida East Coast Railroad to northern markets. Farmers sold timber and land to paper companies. Based on use of the Tillman and Hopkins canals, ranchers raised beef cattle in West Melbourne.[9]\n",

        "paragraph": "Rilya Shenise Wilson (born September 29, 1996)[1] was an American child who was placed in the foster care system of the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF), and was the centerpoint of an investigation into neglect and mismanagement in the organization. She was approximately four years old when she disappeared on January 18, 2001.[2] DCF did not discover her disappearance until two years later, when she was not found living at the home of her caretaker and alleged godmother or grandmother, Geralyn Graham.\nRilya was placed into Graham's care by DCF after Rilya's cocaine-abusing mother, Gloria Wilson, had her parental rights terminated. Despite varying accusations regarding Rilya's parentage and how she came to be in Graham's care, the true relationship between the two is unclear.\nThe last recorded welfare check of Rilya Wilson took place in early January 2001, by social worker Deborah Muskelly. Rilya's caretaker, Geralyn Graham, initially told investigators that on January 18, 2001, an unidentified African-American woman claiming to work for the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) took Rilya for an unspecified evaluation; this was the last time she supposedly saw Rilya. Despite this, Graham continued to cash checks from the state for Rilya's care. She further claimed that Muskelly was aware of Rilya's disappearance. Graham was later jailed for identity fraud and Medicaid fraud for accepting payments on behalf of Wilson after she went missing.[3]\nAuthorities denied that any state worker had ever taken Rilya for medical testing.[4] They claimed to have first learned of Rilya's disappearance on April 25, 2002, the date she was officially reported missing. In March 2002, Muskelly and her supervisor resigned after allegations of fraud surfaced. Muskelly faced forty-one criminal charges regarding her time with DCF, including grand theft. She pled guilty to one count of official misconduct and was given five years' probation; the remaining charges were dropped. She never faced charges directly relating to Rilya's disappearance.[5]\nManville Cash, a man currently incarcerated for auto theft and drug charges, was listed as the girl's \"prospective father\" on documents terminating her birth mother's parental rights. In early 2002, Cash told authorities he last saw Rilya at the home of Pamela Kendrick, Cash's aunt and sometimes mistakenly referred to as Graham's sister. Kendrick briefly had custody of Rilya in 2000 before she was removed amid allegations of neglect.[1] In August 2004, Graham was charged with kidnapping and three counts of child abuse, and Kendrick with two lesser counts of child abuse. Kendrick testified against Graham at her trial, claiming that both of them had spanked Rilya with switches and had locked her in a dog cage and in the laundry room.\nIn March 2005, a grand jury indicted Graham after she allegedly gave a detailed confession to Rilya's murder. Graham had confessed to inmate Robin Lunceford, who testified at trial over four days. In her testimony, Lunceford revealed that Graham admitted to killing Rilya because the child was \"evil\" and was plagued by \"demons\" from previous abuse. Her body was supposedly buried in a ravine close by a place Graham regularly visited for fishing and cookouts. Two other inmates also testified that Graham, while behind bars, suggested she killed the child.[6]\nEvidence of Rilya's abuse was presented at the trial, including the dog cage witnesses said Graham used to punish Rilya, and testimony about the girl's lengthy confinement in a small laundry room. Pamela Kendrick testified that Geralyn regularly tied Rilya to her bed using plastic restraints so she would not get up during the night. Graham alleged that a woman who claimed to work for DCF said she was removing Rilya from the home for evaluation and never returned.\nIn January 2013, the jury convicted Graham of kidnapping and child abuse, but deadlocked 11-to-1 on the charge of murder.[7] On February 12, the judge sentenced Graham to 30 years for kidnapping plus 25 years for aggravated child abuse. Two other abuse sentences\u201425 years and five years, respectively\u2014will be served concurrently for a total of 55 years behind bars. Prosecutors had sought the maximum of life plus 65 years. At 67 years old at the time of sentencing, Graham will end up serving a life sentence.[8]\nThe case led to the resignation of DCF director Kathleen Kearney and the passage of several reform laws, including a new missing-child-tracking system and the contracting out of foster child casework to private organizations. Lawmakers also made it illegal to falsify records of visits between caseworkers and foster children.[8]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Jim Jumper massacre, or Bluefields massacre, was an incident in 1889 at a Seminole Indian camp northeast of Lake Okeechobee, in St. Lucie County, Florida, United States, in which Jim Jumper, a biracial Seminole, killed several Seminoles, and was then killed by another Seminole.\nJumper was the son of an African woman named Nagey Nancy, who had been one of only three African slaves retained by the remnant of the Seminoles left in Florida after the Third Seminole War. The three women had been purchased by Seminoles when they were children. Inheritance in the Seminoles was matrilineal, with a woman's children belonging to her clan. Normally, children with a Seminole father and a black mother would not have belonged to any clan, a distinct disadvantage in Seminole society. The last three African women among the Seminoles were adopted into the clan system. Nagey Nancy was owned by the Snake clan, and her two children by Seminole fathers, Jim Jumper and Nancy, were designated as belonging to the Little Black Snake Clan.[1]\nThe Snake clan, along with other Seminole clans, had lived on Fisheating Creek west of Lake Okeechobee for many years after the Third Seminole War, but in the 1880s a white cattleman bought their herds on the condition that the Seminoles move away. The Snake clan then moved to an area northeast of Lake Okeechobee later called Bluefields.[2][a]\nOne report says that Jumper was living by himself, and had a reputation for bad deeds. A cattleman from Fort Pierce had taken a herd over to Punta Rassa for shipment to Cuba, and was returning home with the money from the sale in gold coins. He spotted Jim following him and suspected Jumper meant to rob him, but, by running his horse at a full gallop, was able to reach his ranch house at Ten Mile near Fort Pierce before Jumper could catch up to him.[3]\nJumper wanted to marry the daughter of Big Tommie, but was told to find a black wife. Jumper insisted that he had been raised to be a Seminole, and wanted to marry a Seminole wife, but was refused again, and reportedly got drunk. Big Tommie's mother, who had recently died, had reportedly said before she died that she wanted her slave Jumper killed and buried with her to be her servant in the afterlife. As Seminoles sometimes killed horses to accompany their owners in the afterlife, Jumper may have worried that he would be killed to join her in death. Jumper was also seen just before the attack to have a bad wound on his leg that may have become infected and made him delirious.[4]\nDescriptions of the attack include ones from Betty Mae Tiger Jumper's grandmother Mary Tiger, from Will Addison, the son of a white settler, who witnessed the attack from a trader's camp next to the Snake Clan camp, from Billy Bowlegs III, Jumper's nephew, from an unnamed source that appeared in The New York Times, and in a book on the history of the cattle industry by Joe Ackerman. Betty Jumper says the attack occurred on February 15, 1889.[5] One article based on an account from Billy Bowlegs places the attack on February 14, 1889,[6] another places the attack in March, 1889.[7] The New York Times article was filed from Jacksonville on March 2, 1889.[8] Details of the attack vary, but Jumper entered the Snake Clan camp and shot and killed several people. Names listed in various accounts include his sister Nancy (Billy Bowlegs' mother), Big Tommie, Big Tommie's daughter and wife, Woxo Micco (also known as Cypress Tom Tiger and Old Tiger), Young Tiger, his wife, Martha Tiger, Jimmy Tiger, a pregnant woman named Lucy, and Lake Willson, as well as unnamed men, women, and children, including two of Nancy's children (no account lists more than six victims by name). A half-brother of Billy Bowlegs was knocked unconscious and feared dead, but recovered.[9][7][6][8][3]\nA boy who was shot at by Jumper escaped and alerted a Seminole named Billy Martin who was working in a nearby cane field. Martin took his rifle and returned to the camp, where he saw Jumper sitting, and shot him. The Seminoles did not want to contaminate their goods with contact with Jumper's body, so they borrowed a wagon and team of oxen from Will Addison's father John, dragged Jumper's body to a cypress pond, and left it to be eaten by alligators. The Snake Clan moved to a temporary camp a short distance away. Jumper's victims were buried nearby, and a medicine man came to ritually clean the camp site. The Snake Clan then moved away from the area.[10]\n\n",

He is suspected of up to 26 further murders.[3]\nDescribed by prosecutor Robert Stone as \"the most sexually deviant person\" he had ever encountered,[4] Schaefer was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment at his 1973 trial, to be served at Florida State Prison. He was stabbed to death by a fellow inmate while incarcerated at this facility in December 1995.[4][5]\nSchaefer became known as the \"Killer Cop\" as he was a sheriff's deputy in Martin County, Florida, at the time of his initial arrest.[6] He also became known as the \"Hangman\" due to his favored practice of binding restrained women to trees with a hangman's noose around their neck prior to their torture and murder.[7]\nGerard Schaefer was born in Neenah, Wisconsin, on March 26, 1946, the first of three children born to Gerard John and Doris Marie (n\u00e9e Runcie) Schaefer. His father was a traveling salesman, and his mother a housewife. He was raised in Nashville, Tennessee, and, later, in Atlanta, Georgia, where he attended Marist Academy until his family permanently relocated to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1960.\nSchaefer later described his childhood as \"troubled and turbulent\", largely due to the frequent family relocations, his father's alcoholism, and his father's frequent verbal abuse of his wife and children. Although Schaefer's father's occupation resulted in his being frequently absent from the household, he had a difficult relationship with his oldest son, who resented his frequent belittling of him and believed his father favored his sister over himself and his brother. By contrast, Schaefer was close to his mother, who was extremely protective of her children.[8]\nAs a child, Schaefer preferred outdoor pursuits. By his adolescence, he had developed an interest in nature. His primary interests as a teenager included collecting guns, hunting, and fishing\u2014activities that he and his father occasionally pursued together when his father was at home.[8] Although hardly a classic loner, classmates at St. Thomas Aquinas High School recall his \"not being part of any clique\". He frequently pursued his interests alone, leading his family and peers alike to view him as an \"outdoors man\" who held aspirations to become a forest ranger.[9]\nBy his teenage years, Schaefer developed erotic fantasies of hurting women whom he deemed worthy of his contempt. These fantasies gradually evolved into his developing a penchant for sadomasochism and bondage, and deriving pleasure from inflicting pain upon himself\u2014occasionally as he wore women's underwear\u2014until he achieved orgasm via autoerotic asphyxia. Typically, these sadomasochistic rituals involved Schaefer tying himself to a tree in rural locations.[10] These fantasies would increase in terms of frequency and intensity with time, gradually dominating many of his waking hours.[11]\nSchaefer also became a peeping tom in his mid-teens and is known to have developed the habit of cross dressing.[8][a] Although he dated in his high school years, several female classmates viewed him with disdain. One former classmate, Barbara Krolick, later recollected: \"I can't remember him being friends with any of the guys. He was always on the outside looking in. As a matter of fact, the only thing I really remember is that I always had to tuck my skirt under my legs because [Schaefer] would practically stand on his head to look up a girl's skirt.\"[12]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe \"Baby Lollipops\" murder was the murder in 1990 of three-year-old Lazaro Figueroa by his mother Ana Maria Cardona, in Florida. The body of Lazaro was found abandoned, and identified through house-to-house inquiries. The case was widely covered in US media, who called the initially unidentified boy \"Baby Lollipops\", after the design on the T-shirt he was wearing when found.\nCardona was arrested for the murder and sentenced to death; her girlfriend, Olivia Gonzalez, was sentenced to forty years. On a second appeal Cardona was sentenced to life in prison. Gonzalez was released after 14 years.\nLazaro Figueroa was born on September 18, 1987, to Ana Maria Cardona and Fidel Figueroa. Cardona also had two older children.[1] Fidel Figueroa was a well-known drug dealer and died under mysterious circumstances on September 20, 1987. This crime remains unsolved.[2]\nIn November 1990, Lazaro Figueroa's body was discovered in front of a beach property in Miami Beach. He had been severely battered, which made it initially very difficult for authorities to identify him. Because Lazaro's remains were unidentified for weeks after his discovery, local news outlets nicknamed him \"Baby Lollipops\" in reference to the shirt he was found wearing.[3]  The cause of death was later determined to be a blow to the head from a baseball bat.[4] Trial evidence showed that shortly after leaving Lazaro's body in the bushes, Cardona and her lover, Olivia Gonzalez, fled to Central Florida, even making a stop at Disney World.[5]\nDespite claims by neighbors and other individuals that Cardona was abusive towards Lazaro, she consistently denied it. Her main defense was that it was Olivia Gonzalez who had beaten Lazaro and delivered the fatal blow with a baseball bat. Cardona attested that she wanted to escape the pain of her son's horrible beatings at her girlfriend's hands and so sank into cocaine use to cope. To support claims on the influence of her past in the case, her defense presented the court with evidence pertaining to her unsettled Cuban upbringing and the psychological devastation caused by the death of Lazaro's father.[6] According to prosecutor Reid Rubin, however, Cardona was \"angry and spiteful\" from the death of her wealthy husband as she had lost a luxurious lifestyle.[5]\nGonzalez, however, was able to state her case against Cardona in exchange for a lighter 40-year sentence on the count of second-degree murder. She served 14 years.[5] While admitting she played a role in her girlfriend's abuse of Lazaro, she was able to lay the majority of the blame on Cardona for Lazaro's eventual death.\nEmployees for the Florida Power & Light Company discovered Lazaro Figueroa's dead body on the morning of November 2, 1990, at Miami Beach, hidden beneath some bushes. The boy was so emaciated that he appeared skeletal, with a bruised right eye. He wore blue gym shorts over a soiled diaper wrapped multiple times with brown packaging tape. At the time of his murder, Lazaro's weight was 18 pounds (8.16\u00a0kg), half the weight of a healthy child his age. The t-shirt he was wearing caused the Miami Beach Police Department to name him \"Baby Lollipops,\" and he remained unidentified for weeks after his discovery.[7]\nThe Miami Beach Police Department hosted a media conference with multiple detectives handling the murder case. They also conducted door-to-door interviews in both English and Spanish to obtain more information about the boy. They received numerous leads and were eventually[when?] able to identify the boy as Lazaro Figueroa, son of Ana Maria Cardona and the late Fidel Figueroa .\n",

As a member of the Bears, he was selected to four consecutive Pro Bowls from 1985 to 1988 and was part of the 1985 defense that won the franchise's first Super Bowl in Super Bowl XX. He also played for the New York Giants and Arizona Cardinals, winning Super Bowl XXV with the former.\nAt age 50, Duerson died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. Following his request, his brain was sent to the Boston University School of Medicine for research on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Neurologists at Boston University confirmed that Duerson had CTE as a result of the concussions he had during his playing career.\nBorn and raised in Muncie, Indiana, Duerson played football, basketball, and baseball at Northside High School. Duerson's honors during his high school years included the 1979 Indiana Mr. Football.[1]\nDuerson played college football at the University of Notre Dame from 1979 to 1982,[2] and graduated with honors, with a BA in economics.  He started all four years for the Fighting Irish, and earned recognition as an All-American in 1981 and 1982. Duerson was a captain and the team's MVP as a senior in 1982, intercepting seven passes and returning them for 104 yards.  He finished his college career with 12 interceptions, which he returned for 256 yards and a touchdown.  He also returned 103 punts for 869 yards and 3 kickoffs for 75.[3]\nHe was the winner of the Edward \"Moose\" Krause Distinguished Service Award in 1990 by the Notre Dame Monogram Club, of which he was a past president. He was also a member of the University of Notre Dame Board of Trustees from 2001 to 2005.[2]\nTaken in the third round of the 1983 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears, Duerson was selected to four consecutive Pro Bowls (1986\u20131989). He won two Super Bowl championship rings, with the 1985 Bears (XX), and 1990 Giants (XXV). During the 1986 season, Duerson set an NFL record that stood for 19 years (Adrian Wilson, 2005) for most sacks in a season by a defensive back, with seven. He also intercepted six passes for 139 yards with a longest return of 38 yards. At season's end, Duerson was named first-team All-Pro by Pro Football Weekly, the Pro Football Writers Association and The Sporting News and second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press.  In 1987, Duerson was the recipient of the NFL Man of the Year Award. In his 11 seasons, Duerson recorded 20 interceptions, which he returned for 226 yards, and 16 quarterback sacks. He also recovered five fumbles, returning them for 47 yards and a touchdown.\nDuerson owned three McDonald's restaurants in Louisville, Kentucky for six months, from late 1994 to April 1995. He purchased the majority interest in Fair Oaks Farms (formerly Brooks Sausage Company) in 1995.[4] He sold his stake in the company in 2002 and started Duerson Foods, but that company was forced into receivership in 2006 and most of its assets were auctioned off.[5]\nDuerson was found dead at his Sunny Isles Beach, Florida[6] home on February 17, 2011. The Miami-Dade County medical examiner reported that Duerson died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest.[7] He sent a text message to his family saying he wanted his brain to be used for research at the Boston University School of Medicine, which is conducting research into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease, which can be caused by playing football.[8] He left behind three sons and a daughter from his marriage to ex-wife Alicia.[7] He was buried in the Cedar Grove Cemetery in Notre Dame, Indiana.\n",

Tongay, the children's father, began training Kathy and Bubba when they were very young. Time magazine reported in 1953 that by the age of ten months, Kathy could swim 20 feet (6.1\u00a0m) deep. By the time each of the children reached 17 months old, they were swimming .25 miles (400\u00a0m) per day.[1]\nIn 1950, Tongay staged a swimming performance for his children in the Mississippi River, 22 miles (35\u00a0km) from St. Louis. Tongay followed in a boat while his children swam along the river. Kathy, age two, swam five miles (8.0\u00a0km) and Bubba, age four, swam the entire distance to St. Louis.[2] The performance was recorded by reporters and served as a national introduction for the two children. Tongay announced that his children would swim across the English Channel.[2]\nFollowing the Mississippi River swim, Tongay began to actively promote the children as an entertainment act and bragged of their diet, which consisted entirely of baby food.[2] Bubba would leap from a 30-foot diving platform and swim underwater with his hands and feet bound. The family later moved to Miami, where the children continued to perform.\nThe Tongays arrived in Europe in June 1951, where the act was regarded as abuse rather than entertainment. Upon their arrival in London, the family was placed under \"technical arrest\" and the British and the French governments forbade Russell Tongay from forcing the children to swim the English Channel.[2] Tongay argued with the British Home Office to permit the swim. Letters to the editor and a general sense that the swim was exploitative caused Home Secretary James Chuter Ede to say: \"I cannot help thinking that swimming the Channel at that early age is rather a severe test even for an infant prodigy.\"[3]\nThe Home Office initially intended to expel the Tongays from the country, but an officer declared that they could stay for one month provided that the children did not swim for profit.[3] Although the Daily Mail had offered the children a $20,000 prize for the stunt, and they had received much publicity, the Tongays returned to the United States without having performed the swim across the channel.[1][2][3]\nThe publicity continued to increase after the family's return from Europe. The children were featured in newsreels and made a cameo appearance in the 1952 musical film Skirts Ahoy!, starring Esther Williams.[2]\nKathy and Bubba were both accomplished platform divers. In May 1953, Kathy Tongay attempted to complete a one-and-a-half layout dive from a height of 33 feet (10\u00a0m) at Miami's Macfadden-Deauville Pool, but her attempt failed and she bellyflopped. Afterward, she complained of back pain, and her father took her to the Treasure Isle Pool, where the children trained five days a week. A lifeguard at the pool later reported that Kathy was badly bruised and ill. Her father fed her some soup and ordered her to enter the pool even though Kathy was crying.[1] She did not swim for long, and after the Tongays returned home, Kathy went into convulsions and died.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Brooks Brothers riot was a demonstration led by Republican staffers at a meeting of election canvassers in Miami-Dade County, Florida, on November 22, 2000, during a recount of votes made during the 2000 United States presidential election, with the goal of shutting down the recount. After demonstrations and acts of violence, local officials shut down the recount early. This had the effect of ensuring that the December 12 \"safe harbor\" deadline set by Title 3 of the United States Code could not be met, guaranteeing that George W. Bush would win the 2000 election.\nThe name referenced the protesters' corporate attire; described by Paul Gigot in an editorial for The Wall Street Journal as \"50-year-old white lawyers with cell phones and Herm\u00e8s ties\", differentiating them from local citizens concerned about vote counting.[1] Many of the demonstrators were Republican staffers.[2] Both Roger Stone and Brad Blakeman take credit for managing the riot from a command post, although their accounts contradict each other.[2] Republican New York Representative John E. Sweeney gave the signal that started the riot,[3] telling an aide to \"shut it down\".[4][5]\nIn the 2000 United States presidential election between candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore, in the state of Florida, George W. Bush achieved an election night majority by 1,784 votes, a very close margin. Due to the closeness of the race, and irregularities such as hanging chads, the Gore campaign successfully advocated for a re-count of certain ballots. Miami-Dade County was one of the counties where ballots were re-counted.\nThe Miami-Dade County Democratic Party chairman suspected that thousands of ballots in this county might have been affected by a voting machine glitch.[6] He suspected that these ballots, after re-tallying, would help candidate Al Gore.[6]  Miami-Dade County official canvassers, in order to meet a court-ordered deadline, decided to limit the county's recount to the 10,750 ballots that their tabulation machines had been unable to tally. They moved the counting process to a smaller room, closer to the ballot-scanning equipment, to speed up the process, at a distance from the media. Republican officials objected to this change.\nHundreds of people, including many Republican staffers,[3][7] descended upon South Florida to protest the state's recounts.[7] The demonstration was organized by these operatives, sometimes referred to as the \"Brooks Brothers Brigade\",[8] to oppose the recount of ballots during the Florida election recount. The official canvassers, to speed up the process and meet their deadline, moved the counting process into a new room, and members of the media were restricted to a distance of 25 feet away.\nRepublicans objected to this change of plans. John E. Sweeney of New York, nicknamed \"Congressman Kick-Ass\" by President Bush for his work in Florida,[9] set the incident in motion[10] by telling an aide to 'stop them'[1][5] and to \"Shut it down.\"[1][5] The demonstration turned violent and, according to The New York Times, \"several people were trampled, punched or kicked when protesters tried to rush the doors outside the office of the Miami-Dade supervisor of elections. Sheriff's deputies restored order.\" Democratic National Committee aide Luis Rosero claimed to be kicked and punched outside of Leahy's office.[11] Within two hours after the event, the canvassing board unanimously voted to shut down the count, in part due to perceptions that the process was not open or fair, and in part because the court-mandated deadline had become impossible to meet, due to the interference.[11][12]\nSweeney defended his actions, arguing that his aim was not to stop the hand recount, but to restore the process to public view.[3] Other Bush supporters acknowledged they hoped to end the recount. \"We were trying to stop the recount; Bush had already won,\" said Evilio Cepero, a reporter for WAQI, an influential Spanish talk radio station in Miami. \"We were urging people to come downtown and support and protest this injustice.\" A Republican lawyer commented, \"People were pounding on the doors, but they had an absolute right to get in.\"[11] The protest interfered with attendance by official observers and hindered access by members of the press.[13] In a radio interview in Albany on November 28, Sweeney said, \"What I essentially told my people is, 'You've got to stop them'.\" \"Whether I said, 'You've got to shut it down' or 'stop them,' I frankly don't quite recall.\"[3]\nSeveral of the protestors were identified as Republican congressional staffers.[3][7] A number of the demonstrators later took jobs in the incoming Bush administration.[14]\n",

Among the Native American leaders and civilians rounded up at the end of the Red River War to be transported as a prisoner of war to Fort Marion in Florida, he is one of two who died during the incarceration.\nHe was a leader of the Hotamitaneo (\"Dog soldier\") society of young warriors.[1]  He was involved in a skirmish with Edwin Vose Sumner's troops at the Kansas River in 1857, and gained recognition among whites in 1867 for battling soldiers under Winfield Scott Hancock and George Armstrong Custer in an attempt to prevent the building of the Kansas Pacific Railroad across tribal lands.[1]  He refused to sign the failed Medicine Lodge Treaty, and continued fighting until 1871, when his people settled on a reservation in Indian Territory.[1]  In what is known as the Red River War, he and other chiefs began raiding settlements again in 1874 out of frustration with poaching of buffaloes.[1]  After participating in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls, Grey Beard and his followers went into hiding in what is now the Oklahoma Panhandle.[1]\nIn late 1874, Grey Beard's band, numbering approximately 500 warriors and family,[1] received two daughters who had been abducted from a family of settlers by Chief Medicine Water, husband of Mochi, on their way to Colorado.[2] The girls were freed after a military surprise attack on his camp on November 8, 1874, near present-day McClellan Creek National Grassland,[3] after which his band scattered across the plains and was pursued for two days across 96 miles by 120 soldiers from the United States Cavalry before escaping.[4][5][6][7]  Facing starvation, he surrendered to the Darlington Agency within a few months.\nBecause he was one of the ringleaders of the insurrection, Grey Beard was chosen to be among the Native Americans to be taken to Fort Marion, the old Spanish fort near Saint Augustine, Florida. Convinced that he and fellow prisoners were going to be killed by the Americans, he asked his captor, Captain Richard Henry Pratt, to write a letter conveying to his people that they should settle peacefully and cooperate with the United States government.[8] He unsuccessfully attempted suicide by hanging himself during the train convoy. Later, he was shot and killed trying to escape.[9] His body was left in Baldwin, Florida where he was later interred.[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Ocoee massacre was a mass racial violence event that saw a white mob attack numerous African-American residents in the northern parts of Ocoee, Florida, a town located in Orange County near Orlando. The massacre took place on November 2, 1920, the day of the U.S. presidential election.[4]\nBy most estimates, a total of 30\u201335 black people were killed in the violence.[1][2][3] Most African American-owned buildings and residences in northern Ocoee were burned to the ground. Other African Americans living in southern Ocoee were later killed or driven out of town by the threat of further violence being used against them. Thus, Ocoee essentially became an all-white or \"sundown\" town. The massacre has been described as the \"single bloodiest day in modern American political history\".[2]\nThe attack was intended to prevent black citizens from voting. Black people had essentially been disenfranchised in Florida since the beginning of the 20th century. In Ocoee and across the state, various black organizations had been conducting voter registration drives for a year.\nIn November 1920, Mose Norman, a prosperous African-American farmer, tried to vote but was turned away twice on Election Day. Norman was among those working on the voter drive. A white mob surrounded the home of Julius \"July\" Perry, where Norman was thought to have taken refuge. After Perry drove away the white mob with gunshots, killing two men and wounding one who tried to break into his house, the mob called for reinforcements from Orlando and Orange County. The mob laid waste to the African-American community in northern Ocoee and eventually killed Perry. They took his body to Orlando and hanged him from a lightpost to intimidate other black people.[5] Norman escaped, never to be found. Hundreds of other African Americans fled the town, leaving behind their homes and possessions.\n\"Most of the people living in Ocoee don't even know that this happened there\", said Pamela Schwartz, chief curator of the Orange County Regional History Center, which sponsored an exhibit on it. For almost a century, many descendants of survivors were not aware of the massacre that occurred in their hometown.[4]\nOrange County, as well as the rest of Florida, had been \"politically dominated by Southern white Democrats\" (also known as Dixiecrats) since the end of Reconstruction.[6] But, in the weeks leading up to the presidential election of 1920, African Americans throughout the South were registering to vote in record numbers.[2] At the same time the Ku Klux Klan was experiencing a revival and had established many new chapters since 1915. Three weeks before election day, the KKK warned the African American community that \"not a single Negro would be permitted to vote.\"[7]\nJudge John Moses Cheney, a Republican running for the United States Senate from Florida, had started a voter registration campaign to register African Americans to vote in Florida, because they had supported the Republican Party since Reconstruction.[6] Mose Norman and July Perry, both \"prosperous African American landowners in Ocoee,\" led the local voter registration efforts in Orange County, paying the poll tax for those who could not afford it.[6] In an effort to preserve white one-party rule, the Ku Klux Klan \"marched in full regalia through the streets of Jacksonville, Daytona and Orlando\" to intimidate opponents.[8] The organization threatened Judge Cheney prior to the election.[6]\nSam Salisbury was a police chief in Orlando, Florida. A native of New York, Salisbury served in the U.S. military and was known as Colonel Sam Salisbury.[9][10] A white supremacist and a member of the Ku Klux Klan, Salisbury bragged about his involvement in the violent oppression and intimidation of African Americans attempting to vote in the previous 1920 election. He was one of the leaders of the events leading up to the Ocoee massacre.[11][12] He was injured in an attack he led on July Perry's home in Ocoee.[9]\nAfrican Americans were met with resistance from the white community when they attempted to vote on election day. Poll workers challenged whether African American voters were really registered.[13] The voters had to prove they were registered by appearing before the notary public, R. C. Biegelow, who was regularly sent on fishing trips so that he was impossible to find.[13] However, African Americans, including Mose Norman, persisted but were \"pushed and shoved away\" from the polls.[13]\n",

Caldwell played college football for the Florida Gators.\nCaldwell was born in Tampa, Florida, in 1979.[2]  He attended Jefferson High School in Tampa,[3] where he was a three-sport standout in high school football, basketball and baseball for the Jefferson Dragons.[4]  In football, Caldwell started at tailback as a freshman; as a sophomore, he converted to quarterback\u2014a position he had never played\u2014and threw for 6,936 yards and 77 touchdowns as a three-year starter.[4]  As a junior in 1996, he threw for 2,338 yards, led the Dragons to the Class 5A state semifinal game, earned high school All-American honors from PrepStar, and was named the Florida Class 5A Player of the Year.[4][5]  He was a first-team all-state selection in 1996 and a second-team selection in 1997.[5]\nIn four high school baseball seasons, he set the Jefferson Dragons' career records for batting average (.379), doubles (25), triples (six), steals (67) and runs (76).[4]  The Cincinnati Reds selected him in the 1998 MLB draft, but he decided to play college football instead.[4]\nCaldwell accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville,[5] where he was a three-year letterman for coach Steve Spurrier's Gators teams from 1998 to 2001.[6]  As a junior in 2001, he was a third-team All-American selection by The National Sports Bureau, an honorable mention All-American selection by the Football News, a semi-finalist for the Fred Biletnikoff Award (annually given to nation's top receiver), and a second-team All-Southeastern Conference selection.[6]  He finished his impressive junior season with sixty-five receptions for 1,059 yards (an average of 16.3 yards per catch) and ten touchdowns,[5] becoming only the ninth receiver in Gators history to gain over 1,000 yards receiving in a single season.[6]  Caldwell majored in leisure service management.[5]\nCaldwell was selected by the San Diego Chargers in the second round of the 2002 NFL Draft with the 48th overall pick.[9] He played for the Chargers for four seasons from 2002 to 2005.[10]  In his rookie season, he had twenty-two catches for 208 yards and three touchdowns and returned nine kickoffs for a 24.4-yard average.[2]  In 2003, he played in nine games with four starts for the Chargers; he caught eight passes for eighty yards and rushed for thirty-nine yards on five carries.[10]\nHis 2004 season began with three touchdown receptions in the Chargers' first five games.[2]  However, in a game against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 6, Caldwell suffered a knee injury, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), and was lost for the season.[11]  He returned to play a full season in 2005.[12]\nCaldwell subsequently signed with the New England Patriots prior to the 2006 season.  He went on to total over 60 catches and 700 yards on the season.  During a playoff game against the Chargers, Caldwell had seven receptions for 80 yards, including a four-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Tom Brady in the fourth quarter.  A week later in the AFC Championship game, he dropped two passes during the Patriots' 38\u201334 loss to the Indianapolis Colts.  Caldwell was released by the Patriots four days before the first game of the 2007 season.[13]\nCaldwell signed a one-year contract with the Washington Redskins in September 2007.[14]  During the 2007 season, he appeared in eight games for the Redskins with fifteen receptions for 141 yards.[10]\n",

Beach studied at Rollins College, Florida (1891\u20131896), the Chicago College of Law (1896\u201397), and Kent College of Law, Chicago (1899\u20131900).[2] In 1900 he was drawn to Alaska at the time of the Klondike Gold Rush.[3]\nIn 1904, Beach was a member of the American water polo team which won the silver medal in the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis.\nAfter five years of unsuccessful prospecting, he turned to writing. His second novel The Spoilers (1906) was based on a true story of corrupt government officials stealing gold mines from prospectors, which he witnessed while he was prospecting in Nome, Alaska.[4] The Spoilers became one of the best selling novels of 1906.\nHis adventure novels, influenced by Jack London,[5] were immensely popular throughout the early 1900s. Beach was lionized as the \"Victor Hugo of the North,\" but others found his novels formulaic and predictable. Critics described them as cut from the \"he-man school\" of literature. Historian Stephen Haycox has said that many of Beach's works are \"mercifully forgotten today.\"[6]\nOne novel, The Silver Horde (1909), is set in Kalvik, a fictionalized community in Bristol Bay, Alaska, and tells the story of a down on his luck gold miner who discovers a greater wealth in Alaska's run of salmon (silver horde) and decides to open a cannery. To accomplish this he must overcome the relentless opposition of the \"salmon trust,\" a fictionalized Alaska Packers' Association, which undercuts his financing, sabotages his equipment, incites a longshoremen's riot and bribes his fishermen to quit. The story line includes a love interest as the protagonist is forced to choose between his fianc\u00e9e, a spoiled banker's daughter, and an earnest roadhouse operator, a woman of \"questionable virtue.\" Real-life cannery superintendent Crescent Porter Hale has been credited with being the inspiration for The Silver Horde, but it is unlikely Beach and Hale ever met.\nAfter success in literature, many of his works were adapted into successful films; The Spoilers became a stage play, then was remade into movies five times from 1914 to 1955, with Gary Cooper and John Wayne each playing \"Roy Glennister\" in 1930 and 1942, respectively.\nThe Silver Horde was twice made into a movie, as a silent film in 1920 starring Myrtle Stedman, Curtis Cooksey and Betty Blythe and directed by Frank Lloyd; and a talkie version The Silver Horde (1930) that starred Jean Arthur, Joel McCrea, and Evelyn Brent and was directed by George Archainbaud.\nBeach occasionally produced his films and also wrote a number of plays to varying success. In 1926 Beach was paid $25,000 to write a brochure entitled The Miracle of Coral Gables to promote the real estate development of Coral Gables, Florida, a planned city.[7]\n",

The family was below the poverty line, and Christine did not receive the necessary early childhood support. Because of this, she was considered mentally challenged; she also suffered from epilepsy.\nWhen her parents could no longer afford to support her, and also because of ongoing arguments between them, Christine spent some of her childhood and youth in various orphanages. She began killing small animals, especially domestic cats, at an early age. In order to test their \"nine lives\", as she later justified her actions, she often caused the animals to fall from heights.[2]\nIn September 1977, the 14-year old Christine's parents forced her to marry 20-year-old Goober Falling, but the marriage, marked by almost daily quarrels and altercations, ended in divorce after only six weeks. After that, she had multiple hypochondriac-like episodes. In the next two years, she was to be hospitalized 50 times, but doctors were unable to find any treatable conditions. She suffered from hallucinations, complained of \"red dots\" that appeared before her eyes, and menstrual bleeding at irregular levels. At the age of 16, she was diagnosed as incapacitated on medical instructions.\nIn order to make money, Falling began working as a babysitter for neighbors and friends.\nOn February 25, 1980, 2-year old Cassidy Johnson was sent to a doctor's office in Blountstown, Florida. She was diagnosed with encephalitis, and on February 28, Cassidy died.  An autopsy listed the cause of death as blunt force trauma to the skull. Falling, who had been babysitting for Johnson, said that Johnson had \"passed out\" and fallen out of her crib. The attending physician did not believe Falling and recommended in a note to police to investigate her. However, this note was lost, and the case was closed.\nShortly after Johnson's death, Falling moved to Lakeland, Florida. Two months later, in early summer 1980, 4-year old Jeffrey Davis died while under Falling's supervision. The autopsy pointed to myocarditis, a heart condition which is rarely fatal, as the cause of death. Three days later, his funeral took place, and Falling was asked to oversee Jeffrey's cousin, 2-year old Joseph Spring. He died a few hours later, doctors diagnosing a viral infection. Doctors also noted that the virus may have caused the death of Jeffrey as well.\nIn July 1981, Falling left Lakeland and returned to her hometown of Perry in Northern Florida. As few families wanted to entrust their children to her care, she began to work as a nursing assistant/housekeeper for seniors; 77-year old William Swindle died in his kitchen on the same day that Falling had started caring for him.\nIn the fall of the same year, the daughter of Falling's half-sister, 8-month old Jennifer Daniels, died. While Falling's half-sister had gone to the supermarket, she left her daughter with Falling for a few moments in the car, during which time the girl stopped breathing. Doctors suspected Sudden Infant Death Syndrome to be the cause of death.\n",

Thompson was then elected as a Jacksonian to the 19th and three successive Congresses (20th, 21st and 22nd). His congressional tenure spanned from March 4, 1821, through March 3, 1833.[2]\nAfter his congressional service, Thompson served as a delegate to the State constitutional convention in 1833. He became an Indian agent[3] to the Seminoles and was appointed in 1834 to superintend the removal of the Seminoles from Florida. This episode of his life was artistically described by Thomas Mayne Reid in the 1858 novel Osceola. Thompson was subsequently killed by a band of Seminoles led by Osceola at Fort King, Florida, on December 28, 1835, and was buried on his estate in Elberton.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "Ryan Paul Freel (March 8, 1976 \u2013 December 22, 2012) was an American professional baseball player. A utility player, Freel played second base, third base, and all three outfield positions in Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Kansas City Royals and Toronto Blue Jays between 2001 and 2009.\nOn December 22, 2012, Freel committed suicide, and was subsequently the first MLB player to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.[1][2]\nFreel attended Tallahassee Community College and was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 13th round of the 1994 amateur entry draft, but did not sign. A year later, he was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 10th round of the 1995 amateur draft. From 1998 to 2002, Freel played in the Venezuelan Baseball League with Cardenales de Lara, becoming Champions in 2001. Freel played 6 seasons in the Toronto minor league system before making his Major League debut on April 4, 2001. He only played in 9 games for the Blue Jays in his rookie year, hitting .273 with 0 home runs, 3 RBI and 2 stolen bases. After the season was over, Freel was granted free agency and signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.\nFreel played the entire 2002 season in the minor leagues with the Durham Bulls, the Triple-A affiliate of the Devil Rays. He hit .261 with 8 home runs, 48 RBI, and 37 steals. On November 18, 2002, he signed with the Cincinnati Reds as a free agent.\nOn July 27, 2005, Freel stole five bases in one game, becoming the first MLB player to do so since the 2000 season. [1]\nIn five seasons with the Reds, Freel hit .270 with 22 home runs, 104 runs batted in, and 134 stolen bases. His best season for the Reds was in 2004, when he hit .277 with 3 home runs, 28 RBI, 37 stolen bases, and 74 runs scored in 143 games.

On July 2, 2009, Freel was designated for assignment to create roster space for the newly acquired Jeff Baker. On July 6, 2009, Freel was dealt accompanied by cash considerations to the Kansas City Royals for a player to be named later.\nOn August 5, 2009, Freel was designated for assignment by the Kansas City Royals. He was released on August 13, 2009. On August 28, 2009, Freel signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers. He was released 2 days later.

        "paragraph": "The Gold Sock killer is the moniker of an unidentified American serial killer who murdered a woman and two teenage girls in Broward County, Florida, between July and August 1973. His nickname came from how he strangled his victims to death with socks; however, a gold-colored sock was only used in two instances.[1]\nOn the night of July 15, 1973, 42-year-old Jonina Gudjonsdottir Kelpien was beaten and strangled to death with a gold-colored stretch sock in her car, which was parked in the driveway of her Fort Lauderdale home. Her purse was missing, but her dog was alive in the backseat of the car. Her body was then dragged about a mile from her home and dumped in the yard of a house on the 200 block of Northeast 12th Avenue. Kelpien was last seen alive at 3:00\u00a0a.m. that night, walking to her car while intoxicated. Some reports state that she was seen in a convenience store at around 3:00\u00a0a.m. Thirty minutes later, a man walked into the same convenience store and told the clerk that he had been questioned by police in a woman's murder. However, Kelpien's body was not found until 7:00\u00a0a.m. An autopsy revealed that she had sexual intercourse shortly before her death.[1]\nOn July 25, 1973, a woman, 25, was attacked by the perpetrator in her first-story apartment on the 400 block of Northeast 16th Avenue in Fort Lauderdale. At 9:15\u00a0p.m., the perpetrator wrapped a sock around her neck as she entered her apartment. The woman fought back, kicking and screaming at her attacker. During the struggle, a coffee table had been overturned and the two fell onto the couch. The assailant then fled the scene, likely fearing that the victim's screams would alert others of the attacker.[2] The assailant, described as slim, blonde-haired, white man, had gained entry into the apartment by prying open a window. Before attacking the victim, he rummaged through the victim's purse, which was located in her closet. Due to a gold sock being used in both crimes, police suspected that the attack was connected to the murder of Jonina Kelpien.[2]\nOn August 8, 1973, two men hunting for land crabs discovered the body of Teresa Ann Williams, 17, in a marshy area off Sheridan street in Hollywood, Florida. A maroon sock was wrapped around her neck, and she was only wearing a bra and top. A pile of clothing, suspected to be hers, was found near her body. Williams' remains were too badly decomposed to determine whether or not she had been sexually assaulted. The place her body was found could only be accessed by foot, and required the crossing of at least one creek or ditch. She was last seen alive ten blocks away on August 3. Her car was later found with a flat tire in the parking lot of an apartment building. Tenants of the building called police after they heard her cat meowing in the backseat of the car.[2]\nOn August 28, 1973, 16-year-old Marisue Curtis was last seen at her apartment complex at Surf Road. At 8:00\u00a0p.m. that night, she left her parents' apartment to go downstairs. Wearing a swimsuit and a jacket, Curtis went downstairs for thirty minutes. The last person to she her alive was her friend, who was also downstairs. At 8:30\u00a0p.m., she told her friend that she had to go back upstairs.[1] At 7:00\u00a0a.m. the next day, Curtis' nude body was discovered by a construction worker in the Intracoastal Waterway. Her body was submerged six inches below the surface, held down by two concrete blocks. A black sock was found tied around her neck.[3]\nAfter Jonina Kelpien's murder, investigators questioned sex offenders in the area. Police also surveilled the crime scenes, questioning anyone who acted suspicious near them. In total, over 200 people were questioned. 35 of these people were given lie detector tests, and each of them passed. Forensic annalists determined the socks used in Kelpien's murder and the attempted murder were from a different pair. Plaster samples of fingerprints and footprints were also taken from the crime scene of the attempted murder.[1]\nPolice had one strong suspect in the case, a man who strangled a woman to death with a scarf in her Broward County apartment in February 1974. Investigators noticed similarities between that murder and the gold sock stranglings. The man was questioned by police about the gold sock stranglings, but was never charged in connection to those murders.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "The lynching of Manuel Cabeza (who is also referred to by his alias which is Manuel Head[1] [2]) occurred on December 25, 1921, when members of the Ku Klux Klan killed him. Two days earlier, they Tarred and feathered him because he was living with a Black woman.\nManuel Cabeza's parents were born on the Spanish Canary Islands before they immigrated to Florida. In Key West, he was known as \"Isleno,\" the Islander, and during World War I, he served as a private in Company B of the 105th Engineers.[1] After he was ordered to report for military service during WWI, Cabeza trained at Camp Jackson, he was assigned the service number 1873913 and on the ship Talthybius, he departed for France as a Private in Company B, 105th Engineers. His unit often came under fire while it was building railways and bridges. During fierce fighting, his unit was pushed back against a river, he was part of a group of volunteers that swam across the river with a rope so the other members of his unit could cross it. He left Europe on April 1, 1919, on the USS Martha Washington and he was honorably discharged later that same year.[1]\nDuring Prohibition, Cabeza illegally operated the Red Rooster, a bar, a coffee shop and a sporting club. It was located on Thomas Street near the waterfront. While he was operating the Red Rooster, he openly lived with a black woman who was named Angela. This interracial relationship did not sit well in the Jim Crow South, and his dealing in liquor put him outside the law. On December 23, 1921, a group of hooded men loaded five cars, kidnapped Manuel Cabeza, beat him half to death, and Tarred and feathered him.[3] Cabeza recognized two of the kidnappers and hunted them down the next day.\nEx-soldier Cabeza was able to track down one of the kidnappers, William Decker, the manager of a cigar factory, and he was also able to shoot and kill him. After the public killing of Decker, he was arrested and detained at the local county jail in Jackson square. [4]\nFor a while, Marines guarded the jail until Sheriff Roland Curry sent them home.[5] On Christmas Day, December 25, 1921, not long after the Marines left the jail, a white mob of fifteen men burst into the jail and beat him with blackjacks. He was then dragged out of the jail, attached to a car and dragged through the streets of Key West to the East Martello Tower where he was hanged from a palm tree. The mob then riddled his body with bullets. He was buried in Key West Cemetery.[6]\nAfter his death, Angela, the black woman who lived with him, allegedly used her voodoo religion to \"curse\" the Klansmen who killed him and during the next few years, they supposedly all died under mysterious circumstances.[3] In 2019, the city of Key West gave him a memorial service and a military headstone. The service was attended by city officials and members of his family, including his 99-year-old niece.[4]\nNotes\nReferences\n",

Aaron and Anthony were lynched in 1856 in Washington County, Arkansas, after being accused of a murder and released by the court, one because he was proven and the other for lack of evidence. Randall was hanged for that crime. An oral history recounts that the white man who had been killed, the enslaver James Boone, had sexually assaulted a Black woman, who killed him in self-defense, and that the three men were implicated by Boone's family.[1]\n"

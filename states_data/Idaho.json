She called her mother at around 2:30 p.m. from a friend's house to report feeling ill from the heat. Because she did not own a car, her mother was unable to pick her up; instead, she advised Christina to rest, lay down, and apply a moist towel to her neck; then, when she felt better, to return home. Her mother assumed she had gotten better and returned to the fair when she did not phone back.[2][3]\nBetween 7:00 and 10:00 p.m., Christina was last seen on the 500 block of 2nd Street. She was not there when her mother arrived to pick her up. When her classmates last saw her, she was reportedly on her way home. Her schoolwork was discovered in pieces at a field outside of Asotin a few weeks after she vanished. Christina was also last seen riding her white ten-speed bicycle at the time of her disappearance.[4] It has never been located.\n",

He would typically approach his victims in public places, either feigning a physical impairment such as an injury, or impersonating an authority figure, before bludgeoning them into unconsciousness and taking them to secondary locations to be raped and strangled. Bundy often revisited his victims, grooming and performing sexual acts with the corpses until decomposition and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. At least twelve of his victims were decapitated and their severed heads kept as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, he broke into homes at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.\n",

The response to that violence, disastrous for the local miners' union, became the primary motivation for the formation of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) the following year.\nThe confrontation of 1899 resulted from the miners' frustrations with mine operators that paid lower wages; hired Pinkerton or Thiel operatives to infiltrate the union; and routinely fired any miner who held a union card.\n",

A violent sex offender with an extensive criminal record, Wood was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1993 murder of 11-year-old Jeralee Underwood in Pocatello, Idaho; following his arrest, he was investigated for several murders committed while living in Louisiana, none of which were definitively linked to him.[1] He died at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution in 2004.[1]\nJames Edward Wood was born James Godwin on December 9, 1947,[2] in Pensacola, Florida.[1] At the time of his birth, Godwin's father Sherman, an alcoholic, was imprisoned in Fort Leavenworth, prompting his mother, Hazel Johnson, to leave the state with the two boys and move to Idaho.[3] His childhood was apparently normal until 1955, when the 8-year-old witnessed the tragic death of his mother, who perished in a fire while saving two other workers at a potato warehouse in Rupert.[3] Godwin later claimed that in his distress, he had tried to put his arms around the waist of a nearby woman, who, instead of consoling him, simply pushed him away. This act caused him to develop a hatred towards women, which was greatly aggravated whenever they resembled the woman who had brushed him off.[4]\nShortly after the tragedy, he was adopted by his aunt and uncle in Idaho Falls, who changed his name to James Edward Wood.[3] During this time period, Wood claimed to have been abused both physically and mentally, which caused him to lash out frequently. Unable to control him, his adoptive parents sent him to the Idaho Youth Training Center in St. Anthony, from where Wood attempted to escape on eight separate occasions but was always caught and returned.[3] In 1963, his father was released from prison and offered to take care of him, with Wood readily accepting and boarding the first bus to Shreveport, Louisiana, where Sherman had moved to. They lived together for some time until Wood moved to Missouri to enter flight school, marrying a woman there in 1966. However, he claimed that shortly after his marriage, he began raping women in Missouri and Illinois.[4]\n",

Afterward, reports held that the Indians' primary objective was to steal horses from Thomas Clark's wagon train party, and that the Indians killed Clark's mother and brother and another man traveling with them during the horse robbery.\nThomas Clark was an Englishman who loved hunting.  He came overland to the Willamette Valley in Oregon in 1848, but soon decamped with Jackson Vandevert and others to the California Gold Rush.  They decided to invest their gains in bringing high quality cattle and horses to Oregon.  By the spring of 1851 Thomas had acquired 17 horses[1] and a few cattle from Kentucky and Illinois.[2]   On the trail west he brought with him his mother, his 25-year-old sister Grace, his 17-year-old brother, Hodgson, another brother named Charlie, and another married sister with her family.  He had a first class hack built for Grace to drive and his mother to ride in.[3]  It may have been the first such vehicle to cross the plains.[4] He had also become the pilot for several other Illinois families headed to Oregon.[5]   The company moved slowly so the animals could graze and arrive in Oregon in good condition.[6]\nCho Cho Co was only twenty years old in 1851 but was already a veteran guerilla fighter.  He led a band of warriors of the Tussawehee sub-tribe of the Shoshone, the most powerful tribe in the area that would become Eastern Oregon, Idaho, and Western Montana.  In this area, the Shoshone were often known by white people as the Snakes.  By late August, the band was short of supplies, particularly good horses, guns, and ammunition.  Cho Cho Co traveled east along the Oregon Trail to meet his uncle, Deer Fly, and borrow soldiers from him.  Now reinforced, he identified the Clark party as his target.[7]\n",

Because of this, Rhoades developed an addiction to methamphetamines which would persist up until his arrest.[3] To provide for his family, he took on various odd jobs both in Idaho and the surrounding states, specializing in sheetrocking.[4] At the same time, however, he started breaking into various homes and stole any valuables he could find.[5]\nOn the morning of March 1, 1987, the body of 21-year-old Stacy Dawn Baldwin, a Red Mini Barn clerk who was working the night shift, was found in an archery range about five miles northwest of Blackfoot.[6] She had been shot three times, and it was quickly determined that her killing was likely linked to a robbery gone wrong that occurred the night before.[6]\n",

This led to speculation that all killings were the work of a single serial killer, who was nicknamed \"The Great Basin Killer\".[2] This assertion has since been disregarded, as over the years it has been established that multiple unrelated serial killers operated in the area and that a majority of the killings were committed by different perpetrators.[3]\nThe initial list of victims included the following nine victims:\n",

The rumor led to nothing but after talking so much about it he got the nickname \"Diamondfield Jack\". After the failed prospecting attempt Jack was hired by Sparks-Harrell cattle company on the Idaho-Nevada border. Davis' job was to keep sheepherders off the cattle's land and after a confrontation that led to wounding of a sheepherder named William Tolman. The sheepherders would change their bed every night to a different position so that the head of the bed would be in a different direction; for the cattlemen would shoot at the head of the beds. Davis was on the run. He began working for the cattle company again the next year and almost immediately as he came back to work, two sheepherders were killed in the area where he was working. Davis became the prime suspect for the killings. A magazine was found in the sheepwagon with a diamond drawn in blood by one of the victims. The sheepmen were killed with .44 caliber bullets shot out of a .45 caliber gun. Diamondfield Jack was known to have bought .44 caliber cartridges when the correct ones were not available. As he was heading towards Mexico, Jack was picked up by authorities in Arizona Territory. He was transported back up to Idaho and sentenced to hang on June 4, 1897. The day before his execution date he was reprieved due to the confessions of two other men to the murders. In February 1899 Davis was transferred to the Idaho State Penitentiary where he stayed until December of that year. Davis was then transferred back to a cell in the Cassia County jail.\nAfter Davis had exhausted his appeals another execution date was scheduled for July 3, 1901. By the time public opinion had shifted in Jack's favor mostly due to the confessions of James Bower and Jeff Gray and to the easing of tension between sheep and cattle herders. The Board of Pardons extended the execution date to July 17, much to the outrage of state prosecutor and future Idaho Senator William Borah. Three hours before Davis' scheduled execution, word arrived at the Cassia County sheriff that his sentence had been commuted to life imprisonment. Davis was moved back to the Idaho State Penitentiary in Boise, Idaho until he was finally pardoned on December 17, 1902 by Idaho Gov. Frank W. Hunt.\n",

Like the first incident  seven years earlier, the 1899 confrontation was an attempt by union miners, led by the Western Federation of Miners to unionize non-union mines, and have them pay the higher union wage scale. As with the 1892 strike, the 1899 incident culminated in a dynamite attack that destroyed a non-union mining facility, the burning of multiple homes and outbuildings and two murders, followed by military occupation of the district.\nThe riot of 1899 resulted from the miners' frustrations with mine operators that paid lower wages, hired Pinkerton or Thiel operatives to infiltrate the union, and the refusal of non-union miners to join or strike.\nAngered by wage cuts, Coeur d'Alene area miners conducted a strike in 1892. The strike erupted in violence when union miners discovered they had been infiltrated by a Pinkerton agent who had routinely provided union information to the mine owners. After several deaths, the U.S. army occupied the area and forced an end to the strike. The response to that violence, disastrous for the local miners' union, became the primary motivation for the formation of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) the following year.\n",

On or about February 4, 1896, two Mormon sheepherders were killed by an unknown assailant while they were camping along a creek in what was then part of Cassia County, Idaho.\nThe gunfighter Diamondfield Jack Davis and his associate Jack Gleason were arrested, but the latter was released and Diamondfield Jack was pardoned in 1902, after serving six years in jail. The deaths of the two sheepherders are the only confirmed killings attributed to the conflict, however, according to author J. Anthony Lukas, the incident was \"one of the last great confrontations in the sheep and cattle wars.\"[1][2][3]\nThe leading figure in the conflict was a prominent cattleman named John Sparks. Sparks came to southern Idaho from Nevada in the early 1870s. A former Texas Ranger, Sparks was one of the first people to explore what was still a very isolated wilderness. He later became the partner of another rancher named Jasper Harrell and eventually they established a series of ranches on both sides of the Idaho\u2013Nevada border. By the summer of 1895, Sparks was the most powerful cattleman in Idaho. He controlled huge stretches of territory, though his ownership was still mostly unofficial. Sparks felt that because he had used the lands for so many years without opposition, there was no way he was going to let the hated sheep destroy it.\n",

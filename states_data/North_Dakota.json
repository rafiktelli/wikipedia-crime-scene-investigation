According to author William Jackson, the ghost of Sophie might be haunting a library built on this location.[1]\nSophia Eberlein was born in the Russian Empire and emigrated to the United States. She married Hugo Eberlein, a well-known Harvey businessman, and had two daughters, Lillian and Alice. After Hugo's death in 1928, Sophia married Bentz. One night Bentz bludgeoned Sophia to death while she slept. He did his best to clean up the scene of the crime and tried to make Sophie's death look like a car accident. However, when Sophia's daughter Lillian came home for the funeral, she found blood in the house and reported her findings to the police. Bentz admitted the crime during the investigation and was sentenced to life in prison. He died in 1944 in the state penitentiary.[2]\nIn 1990 a new library was built on the site of the former Eberlein house. According to author William Jackson, the librarian's office is built directly over the site where Eberlein's bedroom was and librarians report cold chills and other oddities.[2]\n",

Until 1903 executions were carried out in public. The first private execution was that of John Rooney, who was hanged inside the Cass County prison on October 17, 1905. Rooney was the last person executed in North Dakota. In 1915, the death penalty was abolished for ordinary murder, commuting the death sentence of Joe Milo, who was convicted of double murder in course of a robbery.[2] It remained for treason and murder committed by an inmate already serving a life sentence, however, nobody was executed for these offenses until the death penalty was finally abolished in 1973.\nNo federal executions have ever taken place in North Dakota. On February 8, 2007, Alfonso Rodriguez, Jr. was sentenced to death for the kidnapping and murder of Dru Sjodin and is now the only person on federal death row for a crime committed in North Dakota.[3] Because Rodriguez took Sjodin's corpse across state lines, he was eligible for federal prosecution, and therefore for the death penalty.[4] U.S. District Judge Ralph R. Erickson arranged that Rodriguez would be executed according to South Dakota rules.[5] Rodriguez was the first person in North Dakota to receive a death sentence in over a century.[6]\n",

November 22, 2003) was an American woman who was abducted from the Columbia Mall parking lot in Grand Forks, North Dakota, by Alfonso Rodriguez Jr., on November 22, 2003.[1] Her disappearance and murder garnered great media coverage throughout the United States and prompted the creation of the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Registry.\nAt 4:00\u00a0p.m. on Saturday, November 22, 2003, Sjodin, a 22-year-old college student at the University of North Dakota and Gamma Phi Beta sorority member, finished her shift at the Victoria's Secret store located in the Columbia Mall in Grand Forks, North Dakota.[2] After shopping for and purchasing a new purse from Marshall Field's, Sjodin left the mall and began walking to her 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass.[3] During this time, Sjodin was speaking with her boyfriend, Chris Lang, on her cell phone. Four minutes into their conversation, Lang reports Sjodin was saying \"Okay, okay,\" before the call abruptly ended.[4] Lang suspected that the call was just dropped and because Sjodin didn't give any sense of urgency, Lang thought nothing of it.[5] About three hours later, Lang received another call from her cell phone, but heard only static and the sound of buttons being pressed.[2] It was reported by authorities this second phone call originated somewhere near Fisher, Minnesota,[6] but that has remained unsubstantiated. With this second call and Sjodin not showing up at her other job at the El Roco nightclub, there was concern for her whereabouts.[7]\nA week later, on December 1, a suspect, 50-year-old registered level-3 sex offender Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. (born February 18, 1953),[8] was arrested in connection with Sjodin's disappearance.[2]\n",

The family consisted of the parents and four children, the youngest of whom was two months old. They had been there for over ten years and apparently were well off. After February 9, 1930, no member of the family had been seen. Bannon stayed on the farm, telling the neighbors that the Havens had left and he was renting from them. Together with his father he took care of the livestock, staying there until the fall. In October they began selling property and crops, raising suspicion among the neighbors, and the father left for Oregon, allegedly to search for the Havens. In December, Charles was arrested and charged with grand larceny, and during the investigation it was discovered that the Havens had been murdered.[1]\nHavens soon admitted guilt, giving first a statement and then two confessions, in which the details changed slightly. He confessed to having accidentally killed one of the children, and then killing all the others out of fear. He claimed his father had been innocent, but the father was also arrested, in Oregon, and moved back to North Dakota as an alleged accomplice.[1]\n",

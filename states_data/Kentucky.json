Afterwards, the murderers set the house on fire. Emma's mother, next door, saw the flames and sounded an alarm. Neighbors found the three victims inside.\nGeorge Ellis, a bricklayer, soon confessed to the crime, and implicated fellow workers William Neal and Ellis Craft. The three were taken to a Catlettsburg jail, removed to avoid a lynch mob, and returned for trial on January 16, 1882. Neal and Craft were convicted in a ten-day trial and sentenced to death; they appealed the verdict.\n"

The gunman, 25-year-old Wesley Neal Higdon, shot and killed five people and critically injured a sixth person before taking his own life.[1] The shooting is the worst in the history of Henderson County, Kentucky in terms of casualties, surpassing triple homicides occurring in 1799 and 1955.[2]\nHenderson police said that the shooter, who had a reputation for being difficult, had argued with supervisor Kevin Taylor and was being escorted out of the factory by the supervisor. The shooter apparently retrieved a handgun, shot the supervisor, then went back into the factory and shot five co-workers before turning the gun on himself.[3][4][5] Subsequent reports indicate that Taylor had reprimanded Higdon twice before the shooting, once for talking on his cell phone too much and for not wearing safety glasses, then later for an altercation with co-worker Joshua Hinojosa at a convenience store across the street from the factory.\n"

        "paragraph": "The Beauchamp\u2013Sharp Tragedy (sometimes called the Kentucky Tragedy) was the murder of Kentucky legislator Solomon P. Sharp by Jereboam O. Beauchamp. As a young lawyer, Beauchamp had been an admirer of Sharp until Sharp allegedly fathered an illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter.[a] Sharp denied paternity of the stillborn child. Later, Beauchamp began a relationship with Cooke, who agreed to marry him on the condition that he kill Sharp to avenge her honor. Beauchamp and Cooke married in June 1824, and in the early morning of November 7, 1825, Beauchamp murdered Sharp at Sharp's home in Frankfort.\nAn investigation soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, and he was apprehended at his home in Glasgow, four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging. He was granted a stay of execution to allow him to write a justification of his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for complicity in the murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double suicide by drinking laudanum shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. On the morning of the execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing themselves with a knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.\nWhile Beauchamp's primary motive in killing Sharp was to defend the honor of his wife, speculation raged that Sharp's political opponents had instigated the crime. Sharp was a leader of the New Court party during the Old Court \u2013 New Court controversy in Kentucky. At least one Old Court partisan alleged that Sharp denied paternity of Cooke's son by claiming the child was a mulatto, the son of a family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been verified. New Court partisans insisted that the allegation was concocted to stir Beauchamp's anger and provoke him to murder. The Beauchamp\u2013Sharp Tragedy served as the inspiration for numerous literary works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished Politian and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).\n"

On the evening of April 13, 2002, Catron was assassinated by Danny Shelley after he finished a campaign speech at a fish fry and political rally being held at the Shopville-Stab, Kentucky Volunteer Fire Department in the small community of Stab, Kentucky. Sheriff Catron was running for a fifth term as sheriff. His former deputy, Jeff Morris, who was campaigning against him, and Kenneth White, a well-known drug dealer, conspired to commit the murder. He is buried at Somerset Cemetery in Somerset, Kentucky, along with other relatives. A memorial for Sam Catron can be viewed by the public directly across from the fire department, where Catron fell beside his police cruiser.\nCatron graduated from Somerset High School in 1971. His career in law enforcement began in the mid 1970s as a Pulaski County sheriff's deputy. Sam quit in 1981 after Johnny Adams was elected sheriff. In 1982, Catron became the chief of police for Ferguson, Kentucky, leaving the position in 1985 after being elected sheriff of Pulaski County. He held the office the rest of his days. During his tenure, Catron served on the Kentucky Governor's Task Force for Marijuana Eradication, the Pulaski County Rescue Squad, the Appalachian High Density Drug Traffic Area task force, was a member of the National Sheriffs' Association and was named Sheriff of the Year in 1989. Sheriff Catron was well known as an enemy of drug traffickers, flying a helicopter to search for marijuana plants and filling courtrooms with offenders his department had nabbed. In his private life, Catron served on the board of his local Boy Scout troop, was a Vigil life member and past chief of the Kawida Lodge Order of the Arrow, Boy Scouts of America.\nPulaski County Sheriff Sam Catron was killed as a result of a plot concocted by Kenneth White and Jeff Morris. White and Morris influenced Danny Shelley, an OxyContin addict, to carry out their plot. White, who had recently been a DEA informant, led the gullible Shelley to believe that Catron was on the verge of arresting him. The plan called for Shelley to use Morris' motorcycle to escape after he shot Catron, and to meet with Morris and White later. However, Morris' real plan was to meet up with Shelley, kill him under a pretense of self-defense, and pin all of the blame for Catron's death on Shelley. Morris hoped this would make him a local hero and ensure his election as sheriff. After the election, White would then run the county with Morris as his puppet. The plot, which they had conceived earlier that day while at Wal-Mart in Somerset, backfired. Catron was campaigning at the Shopville Fire Department.  As he opened the trunk of his vehicle, Shelley opened fire.  Shelley stopped at the ridge line overlooking the Shopville Fire Department and was immediately spotted by law enforcement.  During the ensuing pursuit, Shelley took a wrong turn and wrecked Morris' motorcycle. Shelley was found at the scene of the accident by local hero David Hoff, who subdued him until authorities arrived. After he was caught, he quickly implicated Morris, who, in turn, implicated White. All three were sent to prison.  Kenneth White was a prisoner of Kentucky State Reformatory until his death in November, 2018. Shelley is serving a life sentence at Little Sandy Correctional Complex in Sandy Hook.\n"

Stivers was discharged on August 5, 1876, while encamped with his unit at the mouth of Rosebud Creek in the Montana Territory, and returned to Kentucky where he attempted to go into business for himself. He died less than a year later, murdered over a business dispute, in Kingston on June 28, 1877, at age 27. Stivers was buried in the city cemetery of nearby Richmond, Kentucky.[5][6][18]\n"

Hackmann Taylor, born in Illinois, was married and had an eight-month-old daughter when she went missing from her home in Lexington, Kentucky.\nHer late husband, George Earl Taylor, was a carnival worker and the prime suspect in the murder case. He did not file a missing person report but told her family that she had left him for another man. He died of cancer in October 1987. Because he was a prime suspect, Hackmann's family excluded his name when they commissioned a new tombstone for her gravesite. Giving her full name and dates, it was added beneath one identifying her as \"Tent Girl\" at her grave at the Georgetown Cemetery.

A mob of people from Kentucky and Virginia took him from the jail and away from town and hanged him, and riddled his body with shots.[2] The killing, which became widely publicized, was the last in a long line of extrajudicial murders in the area, and, prompted by the activism of Louis Isaac Jaffe and others, resulted in the adoption of strong anti-lynching legislation in Virginia.[3]\nAs happens frequently with lynchings, accounts printed by white newspapers differed considerably from those found in Black newspapers. The white papers had Woods (and two young Black women) essentially jumping onto a car (driven by Deaton, who was accompanied by two friends) and then shooting Deaton, a young Virginia man from a well-to-do family who was a foreman in a Kentucky mine. The narrative in the Black papers, prompted by a report written for the NAACP, provided background information that suggested that the two Black women involved may have been prostitutes involved with Deaton and his two companions, and that Woods had some kind of relationship with one or both of the women. The lynching, then, would have served to avert a trial in which Woods's testimony might have harmed the reputation of Deaton, his friends, and his family.\n"

        "paragraph": "The 1959 United Mine Workers strike was a labor action by union miners in Eastern Kentucky. Originally over a pay increase, it grew into a conflict between union and non-union mines that resulted in three deaths. It was the first instance of labor violence in the area since the Harlan County War and was the prelude to the Roving Picket Movement.\nThe economy of Eastern Kentucky in the 1950s was almost exclusively based on coal. After World War II, industries such as locomotives and home-heating turned away from coal to oil and diesel fuel. Large coal companies had to protect their interests, so the Bituminous Coal Operators\u2019 Association was founded in 1950 to bargain with the United Mine Workers of America. In 1952, a contract was negotiated between the two organizations raising wages for workers by $1.90. Another contract in 1955 increased wages another $2.00 per shift. Smaller mines found it harder to compete with the larger mines cooperating with the union.[1]\nThe 126 larger rail mines exported their coal by train and collectively hired over 12,000 workers. The smaller mines hired independent truckers to haul their coal by road.[2] While they only employed 5-20 miners each,[3] they far outnumbered the rail mines at 2,500. These mines could only operate at a profit by paying their workers far below the daily union wage of $22.25 per day, sometimes as low as $4.[3]\n"

        "paragraph": "The Beauchamp\u2013Sharp Tragedy (sometimes called the Kentucky Tragedy) was the murder of Kentucky legislator Solomon P. Sharp by Jereboam O. Beauchamp. As a young lawyer, Beauchamp had been an admirer of Sharp until Sharp allegedly fathered an illegitimate child with Anna Cooke, a planter's daughter.[a] Sharp denied paternity of the stillborn child. Later, Beauchamp began a relationship with Cooke, who agreed to marry him on the condition that he kill Sharp to avenge her honor. Beauchamp and Cooke married in June 1824, and in the early morning of November 7, 1825, Beauchamp murdered Sharp at Sharp's home in Frankfort.\nAn investigation soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, and he was apprehended at his home in Glasgow, four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging. He was granted a stay of execution to allow him to write a justification of his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for complicity in the murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double suicide by drinking laudanum shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. On the morning of the execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing themselves with a knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.\nWhile Beauchamp's primary motive in killing Sharp was to defend the honor of his wife, speculation raged that Sharp's political opponents had instigated the crime. Sharp was a leader of the New Court party during the Old Court \u2013 New Court controversy in Kentucky. At least one Old Court partisan alleged that Sharp denied paternity of Cooke's son by claiming the child was a mulatto, the son of a family slave. Whether Sharp made such a claim has never been verified. New Court partisans insisted that the allegation was concocted to stir Beauchamp's anger and provoke him to murder. The Beauchamp\u2013Sharp Tragedy served as the inspiration for numerous literary works, most notably Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished Politian and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).\n"

White and Morris influenced Danny Shelley, an OxyContin addict, to carry out their plot. White, who had recently been a DEA informant, led the gullible Shelley to believe that Catron was on the verge of arresting him. The plan called for Shelley to use Morris' motorcycle to escape after he shot Catron, and to meet with Morris and White later. However, Morris' real plan was to meet up with Shelley, kill him under a pretense of self-defense, and pin all of the blame for Catron's death on Shelley. Morris hoped this would make him a local hero and ensure his election as sheriff. After the election, White would then run the county with Morris as his puppet. The plot, which they had conceived earlier that day while at Wal-Mart in Somerset, backfired. Catron was campaigning at the Shopville Fire Department.  As he opened the trunk of his vehicle, Shelley opened fire.  Shelley stopped at the ridge line overlooking the Shopville Fire Department and was immediately spotted by law enforcement.  During the ensuing pursuit, Shelley took a wrong turn and wrecked Morris' motorcycle. Shelley was found at the scene of the accident by local hero David Hoff, who subdued him until authorities arrived. After he was caught, he quickly implicated Morris, who, in turn, implicated White. All three were sent to prison.  Kenneth White was a prisoner of Kentucky State Reformatory until his death in November, 2018. Shelley is serving a life sentence at Little Sandy Correctional Complex in Sandy Hook.\n"

One of twenty-four men to be awarded the Medal of Honor for gallantry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876, Stivers was among the soldiers who volunteered to carry water from the Little Bighorn River to the wounded on Reno Hill and awarded the Medal of Honor in 1878. He and two other fellow Kentuckians, Privates William M. Harris and George D. Scott, received the MOH for their role in the battle though Stivers received his posthumously.\nThomas W. Stivers was born in Madison County, Kentucky, on July 15, 1850,[1][2][3] the son of \nJohn W \"Buck\" Stivers (1822\u20131912) and his wife Mary Frances Ballard (1829\u20131884). Tom later moved to Mt. Vernon where he worked as a clerk.[4][5] In August 1871, at the age of 21, he enlisted in the United States Army and was assigned to Company D of the 7th U.S. Cavalry Regiment for frontier duty. At the start of the Great Sioux War of 1876\u201377, Stivers accompanied the 7th U.S. Cavalry to the Dakota Territory and was present at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. He was one of nineteen men who volunteered to fetch water from the Little Big Horn and carry it to the wounded on Reno Hill throughout the battle.[6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15] While four troopers exposed themselves to heavy enemy fire, in order to give covering fire, Stivers and fourteen others managed to leave the right wing of Captain Frederick Benteen's line and crossed eighty yards of \"fire-swept ground\" to reach a deep ravine which they used for cover to get to the river. They then used heavy camp kettles to make repeated trips back and forth from the Little Big Horn to Reno Hill.[16][17]\n[18]\nStivers and the other Little Big Horn water carriers faced great danger, especially with Sioux braves hidden in bushes along the river, and at least one of the soldiers was wounded in an ambush. He and the rest of the water carriers were cited for gallantry, along with five others for direct combat actions, and awarded the Medal of Honor[2][9][10][12][13] two years after the battle[3][7][8][11][14][15][16][17] though Stivers received his posthumously. Stivers was discharged on August 5, 1876, while encamped with his unit at the mouth of Rosebud Creek in the Montana Territory, and returned to Kentucky where he attempted to go into business for himself. He died less than a year later, murdered over a business dispute, in Kingston on June 28, 1877, at age 27. Stivers was buried in the city cemetery of nearby Richmond, Kentucky.[5][6][18]\n"

A mob of people from Kentucky and Virginia took him from the jail and away from town and hanged him, and riddled his body with shots.[2] The killing, which became widely publicized, was the last in a long line of extrajudicial murders in the area, and, prompted by the activism of Louis Isaac Jaffe and others, resulted in the adoption of strong anti-lynching legislation in Virginia.[3]\nAs happens frequently with lynchings, accounts printed by white newspapers differed considerably from those found in Black newspapers. The white papers had Woods (and two young Black women) essentially jumping onto a car (driven by Deaton, who was accompanied by two friends) and then shooting Deaton, a young Virginia man from a well-to-do family who was a foreman in a Kentucky mine. The narrative in the Black papers, prompted by a report written for the NAACP, provided background information that suggested that the two Black women involved may have been prostitutes involved with Deaton and his two companions, and that Woods had some kind of relationship with one or both of the women. The lynching, then, would have served to avert a trial in which Woods's testimony might have harmed the reputation of Deaton, his friends, and his family.\n"

On the evening of April 13, 2002, Catron was assassinated by Danny Shelley after he finished a campaign speech at a fish fry and political rally being held at the Shopville-Stab, Kentucky Volunteer Fire Department in the small community of Stab, Kentucky. Sheriff Catron was running for a fifth term as sheriff. His former deputy, Jeff Morris, who was campaigning against him, and Kenneth White, a well-known drug dealer, conspired to commit the murder. He is buried at Somerset Cemetery in Somerset, Kentucky, along with other relatives. A memorial for Sam Catron can be viewed by the public directly across from the fire department, where Catron fell beside his police cruiser.\nCatron graduated from Somerset High School in 1971. His career in law enforcement began in the mid 1970s as a Pulaski County sheriff's deputy. Sam quit in 1981 after Johnny Adams was elected sheriff. In 1982, Catron became the chief of police for Ferguson, Kentucky, leaving the position in 1985 after being elected sheriff of Pulaski County. He held the office the rest of his days. During his tenure, Catron served on the Kentucky Governor's Task Force for Marijuana Eradication, the Pulaski County Rescue Squad, the Appalachian High Density Drug Traffic Area task force, was a member of the National Sheriffs' Association and was named Sheriff of the Year in 1989. Sheriff Catron was well known as an enemy of drug traffickers, flying a helicopter to search for marijuana plants and filling courtrooms with offenders his department had nabbed. In his private life, Catron served on the board of his local Boy Scout troop, was a Vigil life member and past chief of the Kawida Lodge Order of the Arrow, Boy Scouts of America.\nPulaski County Sheriff Sam Catron was killed as a result of a plot concocted by Kenneth White and Jeff Morris. White and Morris influenced Danny Shelley, an OxyContin addict, to carry out their plot. White, who had recently been a DEA informant, led the gullible Shelley to believe that Catron was on the verge of arresting him. The plan called for Shelley to use Morris' motorcycle to escape after he shot Catron, and to meet with Morris and White later. However, Morris' real plan was to meet up with Shelley, kill him under a pretense of self-defense, and pin all of the blame for Catron's death on Shelley. Morris hoped this would make him a local hero and ensure his election as sheriff. After the election, White would then run the county with Morris as his puppet. The plot, which they had conceived earlier that day while at Wal-Mart in Somerset, backfired. Catron was campaigning at the Shopville Fire Department.  As he opened the trunk of his vehicle, Shelley opened fire.  Shelley stopped at the ridge line overlooking the Shopville Fire Department and was immediately spotted by law enforcement.  During the ensuing pursuit, Shelley took a wrong turn and wrecked Morris' motorcycle. Shelley was found at the scene of the accident by local hero David Hoff, who subdued him until authorities arrived. After he was caught, he quickly implicated Morris, who, in turn, implicated White. All three were sent to prison.  Kenneth White was a prisoner of Kentucky State Reformatory until his death in November, 2018. Shelley is serving a life sentence at Little Sandy Correctional Complex in Sandy Hook.\n"

Dickinson was shot in the chest by the future President, following a garden duel regarding President Jackson's horse, Truxton. The shooting also is said to have stemmed from a drunken insult aimed at Rachel Jackson, future First Lady of the United States. Jackson himself was also wounded in the duel.\nDickinson was born at Wiltshire Manor in Caroline County, Maryland, the son of Elizabeth Walker and Henry Dickinson, the grandson of Sophia Richardson and Charles Dickinson (1695\u20131795), and the great-grandson of Rebecca Wynne (daughter of Dr. Thomas Wynne) and John Dickinson. He studied law under U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall, who wrote formal letters of introduction and recommendation for his student. Dickinson owned a house in Maryland for 3 years before moving to Tennessee, where he became a successful horse breeder and plantation owner. Within two years of his arrival in Tennessee, he courted and married the daughter of Captain Joseph Erwin. Unfortunately for Dickinson, he also ran afoul of fellow plantation owner and horse breeder, Andrew Jackson.\nIn 1805, a friend of Jackson's deprecated the manner in which Captain Erwin had handled a bet with Jackson over a horse race. Erwin's horse, Ploughboy, was scheduled to race Jackson's horse, Truxton; however, Erwin's horse had to drop out of the race.  According to the pre-race agreement, if a horse was unable to race, a forfeit fee of $800 would be paid to the injured party, in this case Jackson.  However, Jackson and Erwin disagreed on how this was to be paid, and a nasty quarrel ensued.[1] Erwin's son-in-law, Charles Dickinson, became enraged and started quarreling with Jackson's friend, which led to Jackson becoming involved. Dickinson wrote to Jackson calling him a 'coward and an equivocator.' The affair continued, with more insults and misunderstandings, until Dickinson published a statement in the Nashville Review in May 1806, calling Jackson a 'worthless scoundrel, ... a poltroon and a coward.'[2]\n"

Despite his clean public image as a \"Pillar of the Community\", Ford was secretly a river pirate and the leader of a gang that was later  known as the \"Ford's Ferry Gang\". His men were the river equivalent of highway robbers. They hijacked flatboats and Ford's \"own river ferry\" for tradable goods from local farms that were coming down the Ohio River.\nFord was an Illinois associate of Isaiah L. Potts and the Potts Hill Gang, highway robbers, of the infamous Potts Inn. James Ford also was an associate of John Hart Crenshaw, an illegal slave trader and a kidnapper of free African Americans, and may have taken part in the Illinois version of the Reverse Underground Railroad. At one point, the outlaws used \"Cave-in-Rock\" as their headquarters on the Illinois side of the lower Ohio River, approximately around 85 miles below Evansville, Indiana.\nJames Ford was born in the Ninety-Six District, Province of South Carolina of the Thirteen Colonies, now present-day Spartanburg, Spartanburg County, South Carolina[7][8] a son of Philip and Elizabeth Ford and a grandson of John Ford. He had two brothers, Philip Jr. and Richard. His father died while Ford was still young, and his mother then married William Prince, who brought the family to what would become Princeton in Caldwell County, Kentucky. This marriage provided James with a number of step- and half-siblings, who provided important contacts for his future political, business, and criminal careers.\n"

They argued that executing them by lethal injection would violate the Eighth Amendment prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. The governing legal standard required that lethal injection must not inflict \"unnecessary pain\", and Baze and Bowling argued that the lethal chemicals Kentucky used carried an unnecessary risk of inflicting pain during the execution. Kentucky at the time used the then-common combination of sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. The Supreme Court of Kentucky rejected their claim,[1] but the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari.\nThe case had nationwide implications because the specific \"cocktail\" used for lethal injections in Kentucky was the same one that virtually all states used for lethal injection. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed all executions in the country between September 2007 and April 2008, when it delivered its ruling and affirmed the Kentucky top court decision.

All three were executed for murder. All of the executions occurred at the Kentucky State Penitentiary (KSP) in Eddyville.[1]\nAs of 2022, Harold McQueen has been the only person executed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky involuntarily since 1976. Edward Lee Harper and Marco Allen Chapman both volunteered to be executed.[2] Harper dropped his remaining appeals while Chapman waived all non-statutory appeals during initial sentencing. (According to the Kentucky Revised Statutes, all sentences of death in Kentucky must be reviewed and affirmed by the Kentucky Supreme Court before they are carried out.)\nAnother execution of note in Kentucky was that of Rainey Bethea. Bethea was executed by hanging on 14 August 1936 for the rape of 70-year-old Lischia Edwards. He had also confessed to her murder by strangling but the Commonwealth indicted him only on the rape charge since that was the only capital crime for which the penalty was public hanging. Had Bethea been convicted and sentenced to death for murder (even with an additional rape conviction), the law as it was written at the time would have required Bethea to have been transported to Eddyville and executed in KSP's electric chair. It was to be the last public hanging in the United States; the execution was witnessed by thousands in downtown Owensboro.\n"

Several community leaders arrived and told the crowd that no decision had been reached, and alluded to disturbances in the future if the officer was reinstated. By 8:30, the crowd began to disperse.\nHowever, rumors (which turned out to be untrue) were spread that Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee speaker Stokely Carmichael's plane to Louisville was being intentionally delayed by whites. After bottles were thrown by the crowd, the crowd became unruly and police were called. However the small and unprepared police response simply upset the crowd more, which continued to grow.

The white papers had Woods (and two young Black women) essentially jumping onto a car (driven by Deaton, who was accompanied by two friends) and then shooting Deaton, a young Virginia man from a well-to-do family who was a foreman in a Kentucky mine. The narrative in the Black papers, prompted by a report written for the NAACP, provided background information that suggested that the two Black women involved may have been prostitutes involved with Deaton and his two companions, and that Woods had some kind of relationship with one or both of the women. The lynching, then, would have served to avert a trial in which Woods's testimony might have harmed the reputation of Deaton, his friends, and his family.\n"

The shooter apparently retrieved a handgun, shot the supervisor, then went back into the factory and shot five co-workers before turning the gun on himself.[3][4][5] Subsequent reports indicate that Taylor had reprimanded Higdon twice before the shooting, once for talking on his cell phone too much and for not wearing safety glasses, then later for an altercation with co-worker Joshua Hinojosa at a convenience store across the street from the factory.\n"

Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed down the stairs to the pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.[2]\n"

The deputies correctly expected violence, and had prepared for some sort of attack. The striking miners waited for the motorcade near the Evarts railroad, and as the motorcade approached them, a single shot rang out. No one knows who fired it, but each side blamed the other. The motorcade halted, and Deputy Jim Daniels, one of the most hated anti-union deputies in the county, jumped out and hid behind a rock.[5] Daniels raised his head to fire at the miners, but as soon as he did so, he was fatally shot and killed. The exchange of gunfire lasted for fifteen minutes, with an estimated 1,000 shots fired. When it ended, the three deputies and one miner lay dead.[5]\n"

At least sixteen people, including one child, were killed during the course of the feud, and many others were seriously injured.[1] The feud took place primarily in the border areas of Hawkins County (formerly part of Sullivan County, North Carolina, one of the earliest Tennessee counties and said to have a large Melungeon population), Washington County, Claiborne County, Hancock County, Tennessee (created when Hawkins County, Tennessee was subdivided), and Lee County, Virginia, not far from Cumberland Gap, the narrow Appalachian Mountain pass sometimes called The Wilderness Road leading into Kentucky.\nMost of the history of this feud is found in family records, particularly in a self-published small-edition book by Alton Lee Greene, a genealogist who lived in Sanger, Texas. Alton Lee Greene (a 20th-century descendant of the feuding families) traced the genealogy of the descendants of American colonist Judge William Greene, a judge in the Court of Common Pleas who was born in Lincolnshire, England in 1671 and died in 1722 in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.[2] Judge Greene married Joanna \"Hannah\" Reeder, the daughter of John Reeder and Joanna  Burroughs Reeder, who was born in 1699 in Newtown, Long Island, New York.  Judge William Greene and Hannah settled in the area of Ewing, New Jersey and built the William Green House (Ewing Township, New Jersey), now on the National Historic Register and located on the campus of The College of New Jersey. Despite fund-raising efforts, the old farmhouse near where the troops of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River once rested during the Revolutionary War, has never been fully restored.[3]\nJudge William Greene and Joanna Reeder Greene were the great-grandparents of Jeremiah Greene, who along with other Greene relatives migrated to an area near Rowan, North Carolina (a vast county of indefinite boundaries formed in 1753), where they formed a community called The Jersey Settlement by joining West Jersey residents who left New Jersey due to their unwillingness to adhere to the demands of Colonel Daniel Coxe, an English Colonial landowner and physician. Disgusted by Coxe's rampant political corruption, the Greene family settled near the Yadkin River in North Carolina and started the Jersey Settlement Meeting House, now on the National Historic Register. Jeremiah's family migrated to the Jersey Settlement and then to Hancock County, Tennessee, where his descendants figured prominently in the Greene\u2013Jones War.[4]\n"

The intersection, and Parkland in general, had recently become an important location for Louisville's black community, as the local NAACP branch had moved its office there.\nThe crowd was protesting against the possible reinstatement of a white officer who had been suspended for beating a black man some weeks earlier. Several community leaders arrived and told the crowd that no decision had been reached, and alluded to disturbances in the future if the officer was reinstated. By 8:30, the crowd began to disperse.\nHowever, rumors (which turned out to be untrue) were spread that Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee speaker Stokely Carmichael's plane to Louisville was being intentionally delayed by whites. After bottles were thrown by the crowd, the crowd became unruly and police were called. However the small and unprepared police response simply upset the crowd more, which continued to grow.

The deputies correctly expected violence, and had prepared for some sort of attack. The striking miners waited for the motorcade near the Evarts railroad, and as the motorcade approached them, a single shot rang out. No one knows who fired it, but each side blamed the other. The motorcade halted, and Deputy Jim Daniels, one of the most hated anti-union deputies in the county, jumped out and hid behind a rock.[5] Daniels raised his head to fire at the miners, but as soon as he did so, he was fatally shot and killed. The exchange of gunfire lasted for fifteen minutes, with an estimated 1,000 shots fired. When it ended, the three deputies and one miner lay dead.[5]\n"

The demonstrations happened regularly in the largest cities in Kentucky, including Louisville and Lexington.[3][4] Many of the smaller cities had protests on at least one day.[5][6]\nOn June 5, protesters gathered at the old \"El Mariachi\" building on Daniel Boone Drive before marching to the Court Square. This is the first Black Lives Matter protest in Barbourville and was organized by the Tri-County Fairness Coalition. The crowd took a knee and engaged in an eight minute and 46 second moment of silence; the amount of time Derek Chauvin spent kneeling on George Floyd's neck while he was murdering Floyd. Floyd's murder and the death of Louisville's Breonna Taylor spurred protests across the country over racism and police brutality. The Barbourville protest was held on what would have been Taylor's 27 birthday.[7]\n"

At least sixteen people, including one child, were killed during the course of the feud, and many others were seriously injured.[1] The feud took place primarily in the border areas of Hawkins County (formerly part of Sullivan County, North Carolina, one of the earliest Tennessee counties and said to have a large Melungeon population), Washington County, Claiborne County, Hancock County, Tennessee (created when Hawkins County, Tennessee was subdivided), and Lee County, Virginia, not far from Cumberland Gap, the narrow Appalachian Mountain pass sometimes called The Wilderness Road leading into Kentucky.\nMost of the history of this feud is found in family records, particularly in a self-published small-edition book by Alton Lee Greene, a genealogist who lived in Sanger, Texas. Alton Lee Greene (a 20th-century descendant of the feuding families) traced the genealogy of the descendants of American colonist Judge William Greene, a judge in the Court of Common Pleas who was born in Lincolnshire, England in 1671 and died in 1722 in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.[2] Judge Greene married Joanna \"Hannah\" Reeder, the daughter of John Reeder and Joanna  Burroughs Reeder, who was born in 1699 in Newtown, Long Island, New York.  Judge William Greene and Hannah settled in the area of Ewing, New Jersey and built the William Green House (Ewing Township, New Jersey), now on the National Historic Register and located on the campus of The College of New Jersey. Despite fund-raising efforts, the old farmhouse near where the troops of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River once rested during the Revolutionary War, has never been fully restored.[3]\nJudge William Greene and Joanna Reeder Greene were the great-grandparents of Jeremiah Greene, who along with other Greene relatives migrated to an area near Rowan, North Carolina (a vast county of indefinite boundaries formed in 1753), where they formed a community called The Jersey Settlement by joining West Jersey residents who left New Jersey due to their unwillingness to adhere to the demands of Colonel Daniel Coxe, an English Colonial landowner and physician. Disgusted by Coxe's rampant political corruption, the Greene family settled near the Yadkin River in North Carolina and started the Jersey Settlement Meeting House, now on the National Historic Register. Jeremiah's family migrated to the Jersey Settlement and then to Hancock County, Tennessee, where his descendants figured prominently in the Greene\u2013Jones War.[4]\n"

The intersection, and Parkland in general, had recently become an important location for Louisville's black community, as the local NAACP branch had moved its office there.\nThe crowd was protesting against the possible reinstatement of a white officer who had been suspended for beating a black man some weeks earlier. Several community leaders arrived and told the crowd that no decision had been reached, and alluded to disturbances in the future if the officer was reinstated. By 8:30, the crowd began to disperse.\nHowever, rumors (which turned out to be untrue) were spread that Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee speaker Stokely Carmichael's plane to Louisville was being intentionally delayed by whites. After bottles were thrown by the crowd, the crowd became unruly and police were called. However the small and unprepared police response simply upset the crowd more, which continued to grow. The police, including a captain who was hit in the face by a bottle, retreated, leaving behind a patrol car, which was turned over and burned.\n"

Sharp; the crime is known as the Beauchamp\u2013Sharp Tragedy. In 1821, Sharp had been accused in Bowling Green, Kentucky by Anna Cooke of fathering her illegitimate child; it was stillborn.[a] Sharp denied paternity, and public opinion favored him. In 1824, Beauchamp married Cooke, who was seventeen years older than he. She asked him to kill Sharp to defend her honor.\nWhen Sharp campaigned in 1825 for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives, opponents revived the story of his alleged illegitimate child by Cooke. They distributed campaign literature claiming the child was mulatto. Enraged, Beauchamp renewed his intention to avenge his wife's honor. In the early morning of November 7, 1825, he tricked Sharp to open the door at his home in Frankfort, and fatally stabbed him.\nBeauchamp was convicted of the murder and sentenced to hang. The morning of the execution, he and his wife attempted a double suicide by stabbing themselves with a knife she had smuggled into prison. She died from the attempt; he did not. Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows before he could bleed to death, and was hanged on July 7, 1826. The bodies of Jereboam and Anna Beauchamp were arranged in an embrace and buried in a single coffin, as they had requested. The Beauchamp\u2013Sharp Tragedy inspired fictional works such as Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play, Politian, and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).\n"

The governor's legislative allies passed legislation providing for a favorable change of venue for the trial, and the governor used his appointment power to ensure that sympathetic judges would hear the case. Isaac Desha was twice convicted, but both times, the judge in the case set aside the verdict on procedural grounds. While awaiting a third trial, Desha attempted suicide by slitting his throat, but doctors saved his life, reconnecting his severed windpipe with a silver tube. Shortly after the suicide attempt, Governor Desha issued a pardon for his son.\nIsaac Desha left Kentucky and assumed an alias. He went to New Orleans. From there, he traveled with a man named Thomas Early to San Antonio, Texas. When Early went missing during their travels, Desha fell under suspicion. A former Kentuckian living in Texas recognized Desha. Arrested soon after Early's body was found, Desha confessed to the murder after being recognized by a second man from Kentucky. A day before his trial was to start, Desha died of a fever. A legend soon arose that he had faked his death and fled to Hawaii, where he married a native woman and fathered several children.

Afterward, a supervisor netted him a date with his sister-in-law. Six months before his 1983 arrest, Simmons was granted a job as a halfway-house counselor. Though he was considered an upstanding young man by his peers, a psychiatrist who would later evaluate Simmons before his trial diagnosed him with mild depression.[4]\nOn May 18, 1981, a fisherman discovered the body of 15-year-old Robin L. Barnes in a marshy area of south Jefferson County. Barnes was a former middle school cheerleader who had a history of running away from home and was known to hitchhike.[5] She was fully clothed, and police originally began investigating relatives and acquaintances of Barnes, reportedly conducted as many as 75 interviews with people with ties to Barnes. Eventually, detectives located a singular pubic hair on her coat, which suggested she might have been raped.[5]\n"

In the aftermath of war, most veterans had retained their arms. The Freedmen's Bureau reported \"hundreds of outrages\" against blacks during this year.[3] The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had been passed by Congress, giving blacks the right to testify against whites in court, but Kentucky courts ignored the law, and white vigilantes went largely unpunished.[3]\nIn areas with a relatively small black population, like Gallatin County, whites sometimes tried to drive all blacks away. During the 1866 race riot, for example, some 500 whites in Warsaw were \"whipping Blacks, stealing their property, and ordering them to leave the area,\" according to a letter by the local Freedman's Bureau office.[4][1]\n"

A mob of people from Kentucky and Virginia took him from the jail and away from town and hanged him, and riddled his body with shots.[2] The killing, which became widely publicized, was the last in a long line of extrajudicial murders in the area, and, prompted by the activism of Louis Isaac Jaffe and others, resulted in the adoption of strong anti-lynching legislation in Virginia.[3]\nAs happens frequently with lynchings, accounts printed by white newspapers differed considerably from those found in Black newspapers. The white papers had Woods (and two young Black women) essentially jumping onto a car (driven by Deaton, who was accompanied by two friends) and then shooting Deaton, a young Virginia man from a well-to-do family who was a foreman in a Kentucky mine. The narrative in the Black papers, prompted by a report written for the NAACP, provided background information that suggested that the two Black women involved may have been prostitutes involved with Deaton and his two companions, and that Woods had some kind of relationship with one or both of the women. The lynching, then, would have served to avert a trial in which Woods's testimony might have harmed the reputation of Deaton, his friends, and his family.\n"

In 1914 he shot a suspect during an arrest.[1] Although he was found to be blameless for the death, Hohnhorst became guilt-ridden, which led to alcoholism, lack of sleep and stomach pains.[2] Hohnhorst committed suicide with his service revolver, with the death certificate citing \"temporary insanity\" as the reason for his death.[2]\nThis biographical article relating to an American baseball first baseman is a stub.

Throughout his life, Johnson claimed to have been involved with many prominent Americans and in many important US events, however evidence would later come to light disputing most of these claims.\nAfter becoming involved with Christianity in his youth, Johnson traveled with missionaries in Tennessee and South America before founding a controversial Louisville-area church in the late 1970s\u2014Heart of Fire Church.  With Johnson as its bishop, Heart of Fire eschewed the trappings of traditional Christian churches, and instead at times featured toplessness, cigarette-smoking, underage drinking, anti-Islamism, and a tattoo parlor.  Following arson in 2000, the church was rebuilt after Johnson was sued by his insurance provider.\n"

He began to explore his passion for photography, eventually studying under the legendary Alexey Brodovitch, who \"taught a generation of photographers [...] that the creative process should be a full exploration about what was unique in one's own vision\".[4] In 1958, he received an assignment from Esquire magazine that launched his career as a photographer, when 57 jazz musicians assembled in Harlem, New York for a group portrait.[5][6][7] Later known as A Great Day in Harlem, the resulting image has been described as \"the most iconic photograph in jazz history\",[8] and was the subject of Jean Bach's 1994 documentary film of the same name.[9][10]\nHis work was provocative, experimental, and playful, sometimes rejected by magazines for nudity or irreverence. Kane said of his approach to portraiture: \"If you want to shoot a performer then grab them, own them, you have to own people, then twist them into what you want to say about them.\"[11] In the book The Nikon Image, he was quoted in  as saying: \"I've always considered myself an illustrator, a literate photographer interested in producing images that reflect the essence of an idea.

The bodies of Jereboam and Anna Beauchamp were arranged in an embrace and buried in a single coffin, as they had requested. The Beauchamp\u2013Sharp Tragedy inspired fictional works such as Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play, Politian, and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).\n"

        "paragraph": "Rainey Bethea (c.\u20091909[b] \u2013 August 14, 1936) was the last person publicly executed in the United States. Bethea, who confessed to the rape and killing of a 70-year-old woman named Lischia Edwards, was convicted of her rape and publicly hanged in Owensboro, Kentucky. Mistakes in performing the hanging, and the surrounding media circus, contributed to the end of public executions in the United States.\nLittle is known about Bethea's life before he arrived in Owensboro in 1933. Born around 1909 in Roanoke, Virginia, Bethea was an African-American man orphaned after the death of his mother in 1919 and his father in 1926. He worked for the Rutherford family and lived in their basement for about a year, and then he moved to a cabin behind the house of a man named Emmett Wells. He worked as a laborer and later rented a room from a woman, Mrs. Charles Brown. He also attended a Baptist church.[citation needed]\nBethea's first run-in with the law happened in 1935, when he was charged with breach of the peace and then fined $20. In April of the same year, he was caught stealing two purses from the Vogue Beauty Shop. Since the value of the purses exceeded $25, Bethea was convicted of a felony, grand larceny, and consequently sentenced to one year in the Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville. He arrived there on June 1, 1935, and his prison physical exam information describes him as 5\u00a0ft. 4+3\u20448\" (1.635 m) tall and weighing 128 pounds (58\u00a0kg). He gained parole half a year later on December 1, 1935.\n"

It is around North 27th Street and the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks in Kansas City, Kansas. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 22, 2002.\nIt was settled by abolitionists in late 1856, with construction starting in 1857. The boomtown population peaked at 600, rapidly settled by migrants. They were aided by the New England Emigrant Aid Company, who were trying to help secure Kansas as a free territory.[2]  One of several villages hugging the narrow bank of the Missouri River under the bluffs, the town was a free state port-of-entry for abolitionist forces of Kansas. It was established as part of the resistance to stop the westward spread of slavery. Quindaro's people also aided escaped slaves from Missouri and connected them with the Underground Railroad.\nAfter Kansas was established as a free state, there was less unique need for the port and the growth slowed in the commercial district.  At the same time the economy in Kansas suffered from over-speculation.\n",

In his opposition to slavery, Hyatt organized the efforts of abolitionists in Kansas to have the territory admitted to the Union as a free-state and campaigned for the federal government to aid Kansans afflicted by drought. Hyatt befriended John Brown and provided Brown with financial support; following the raid on Harpers Ferry, Hyatt was investigated by a committee of the United States Senate.[1][2] When Hyatt refused to comply with a Congressional subpoena and cooperate with the Senate investigation, the Senate voted to jail the recalcitrant abolitionist.[1][3] As an inventor, Hyatt was a wealthy man, profiting from his invention of iron-and-glass vault covers for admitting sunlight to spaces below sidewalks and pavements.[4] Hyatt also innovated and patented several designs for reinforced concrete floors.[5][6]\nBorn in Rahway, New Jersey,[2] Thaddeus Hyatt became actively involved in the abolitionist movement after Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854.[1] The law, which mandated that the question of legalizing slavery in Kansas be settled by the territory's voters, sparked a race between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions to move to Kansas and tip the ballot boxes. Opposing settlers violently clashed in what became known as Bleeding Kansas. In 1854, several state-level committees were formed to provide aid to anti-slavery settlers in Kansas, including the New York Kansas League, of which Thaddeus Hyatt was president. Along with well-known abolitionists such as Andrew Reeder, Gerrit Smith, and Eli Thayer, Hyatt organized the National Kansas Committee in July 1856 and was elected president of the organization.[7] The National Kansas Committee purportedly collected around $100,000  to sponsor two thousand new settlers. Of this amount, around $10,000 was spent on weaponry.[8] Although the organization was active from July 1856 onward, the entire committee formally convened only once, in January 1857. Among the items delivered to settlers were one hundred tons of seeds, the cost of which Hyatt underwrote. By mid-1857, the National Committee had dispersed its supplies and depleted its funds, and the activities of the organization wound down.[9]\n",

Reid, attacked the town of Osawatomie, Kansas, which had been settled largely by anti-slavery Free-Staters. Reid was intent on destroying the Free-State settlement and then moving on to Topeka and Lawrence to do more of the same. Abolitionist John Brown first learned of the raiders when they shot his son Frederick. With just 40 or so men, Brown tried to defend the town against the pro-slavery partisans, but ultimately was forced to withdraw; five Free-Staters were killed in the battle, and the town of Osawatomie was subsequently looted and burned by Reid's men. The battle was one of a series of violent clashes between abolitionists and pro-slavery partisans in Kansas and Missouri during the Bleeding Kansas era.\nThe passing of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in 1854 began the period called \"Bleeding Kansas\". Whether the new Kansas Territory would be slave or free was left up to popular sovereignty, counter to the prohibitions of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. An immediate rush of migrants on both sides of the issue rushed in to settle and to determine the fate of the new territory. Almost immediately, tensions erupted into a full-blown border war waged mostly between civilians known as \"Free-Staters\", mostly from New England and other northeast states, and pro-slavery \"Border ruffians\" from Missouri.\n",

The term \"tragic prelude\" for this period of Kansas history is attributed by Curry to his champion, the newspaper editor William Allen White.\nHowever, the mural has other figures in addition to Brown, as it turns a corner and continues on another wall, making it difficult to photograph in its entirety. The three figures are rarely discussed as part of the work. Chronologically from right to left are the Franciscan missionary Fray Juan de Padilla and the conquistador Coronado, the first Europeans to visit the land that became Kansas, followed by a plainsman, who has just killed a buffalo.\n",

He published the Westport Border Star, a pro-slavery newspaper, and became Justice of the Peace of Kaw Township, Jackson County, Missouri, in 1855.[2] Pate was part of the sacking of Lawrence and, either during or shortly before, was commissioned as a Deputy United States Marshal.[3] On hearing news of John Brown's actions at the Pottawatomie Massacre, Pate set out with a band of thirty men to hunt Brown down.[4] During the hunt for Brown, two of his sons (Jason and John Junior) were captured (either by Pate or another marshal), charged with murder, and thrown in irons.[4][3]\n",

At Straight Creek they faced a posse of U.S. marshals and others, who hoped to earn the $3,000 reward posted for Brown's capture. Brown, who \"inspired terror in his enemies\",[1]\nfaced a posse of 45 while his party only consisted of 21, including women and children. Brown led his party straight ahead, and the posse turned and ran in panic. Not a shot was fired nor a rifle raised.[2] \"Free-Staters labeled the confrontation the 'Battle of the Spurs,' in mocking reference to the proslavery posse fleeing on horseback.\"[1] There is a historical marker.[3]\n",

On May 19, 1858, approximately 30 men led by Charles Hamilton, a Georgia native and proslavery leader, crossed into the Kansas Territory from Missouri. They arrived at Trading Post, Kansas in the morning and then headed back to Missouri. Along the way they captured 11 Free-Staters, none of whom were armed and, it is said, none of whom had participated in the ongoing violence. Most of the men knew Hamilton and apparently did not realize he meant them harm. These prisoners were led into a defile, where Hamilton ordered his men to shoot, firing the first and last bullet himself. Five men were killed and five severely wounded. Only one Free-Stater escaped injury.[3]\nHamilton and his gang returned to Missouri. Only one man was ever prosecuted for the crime. William Griffith of Bates County, Missouri, was arrested in the spring of 1863 and was kept until October 30th of that year. Charles Hamilton returned to Georgia, where he died in 1880.\nThe incident horrified the U.S. and inspired John Greenleaf Whittier to write a poem on the murders, \"Le Marais du Cygne\", which appeared in the September 1858 The Atlantic Monthly.[4]\n",

It may be the shortest-lived capital of any U.S. state or territory (Colorado City also served as the capital of the newly established Colorado Territory for five days in 1862 but was not federally recognized).\nFor many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans.  From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America.  In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.  In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France.  In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.  In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized.\nPawnee, named after a native tribe that had inhabited its land,[2] was located on the far western frontier of Kansas Territory, between the new settlement of Manhattan, Kansas, and the U.S. Army post at Fort Riley.  Pawnee was first laid out in 1854.[3] Fort Riley's commander, Colonel William R. Montgomery, authorized the acquisition by the Pawnee Town Association investors of 400 acres believed to be part of the military reservation.[4] In December 1854 or January 1855, the site was selected as capital by recently-commissioned first Territorial Governor Andrew Reeder, after his delayed arrival from Pennsylvania.[5] Governor Reeder had an economic stake in the site, since he was one of the investors and a new landowner in the settlement,[4] and he was not disappointed: Within six weeks of his announcement, hundreds of people arrived in the town.[6]  It quickly sprouted new homes, stores, and hotels,[7][8] and he soon built a 2-story log cabin there that became known as the \"Governor's Mansion\".[6]\n",

Because of  tensions over slavery, four quite different constitutions of Kansas were drafted.\nThe Topeka Constitutional Convention met in opposition to the first territorial legislature, from which free-staters had been excluded, and that they called \"bogus\".

The constitution was sent to Congress and approved by the House on July 2, 1856, but, opposed by President Pierce, failed in the Senate by two (Southern) votes.\nThe Territorial Legislature met in Lecompton in September 1856 to prepare a rival document.

The building was the meeting place for the first elected Territorial Legislature in 1855. After falling into disrepair, the structure was restored in 1928 and today it serves as a history museum operated by the Kansas Historical Society and supported through The Partners of the First Territorial Capitol.\nThe capitol is located in the Kaw valley of northeastern Kansas, 100 yards (91\u00a0m) north of the Kansas River. It first sat along the eastern border of Fort Riley, but today is within the boundaries of the base. A 2.8-acre (1.1\u00a0ha) site on which the building stands was provided to the Kansas Historical Society through a revocable license from the War Department in 1928.[2] It is separated from the river by a grove of trees, and Union Pacific Railroad lines run parallel to the building close to its north side.\nConstruction began with about thirty workers under the direction of Warren Beckworth[3] and was essentially completed in 1855. The building's foundation is roughly 40 by 80 feet (12 by 24\u00a0m), and it is two stories tall. Each floor is identically arranged for an assembly hall, with support columns down the center, and a stairway connecting the floors on the south side.[3] Its foundation and walls are made of native limestone. A stone chimney is at each short side, with bricked exteriors. Its ceilings are exposed structural timbers. Doors are of wood with cut-stone thresholds, and window sills are also cut stone. Hanging lanterns for lighting were probably used.[3] During its 1927 restoration, wood timbers were used that were chipped to make them look hand-cut. 2-inch (51\u00a0mm) planks were used for the floors and set with iron nails. Hand-forged hardware attached doors and windows. The roof was shingled with 3-foot (0.91\u00a0m) tiles split to resemble shakes.[4]\n",

Pate near Baldwin City, Kansas. The battle is cited as one incident of \"Bleeding Kansas\" and a contributing factor leading up to the American Civil War of 1861 to 1865.\nIn 1854, the U.S. Congress had passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act which stipulated that the residents of these territories would decide whether they wished to enter the Union as a slave or free state. This doctrine became known as popular sovereignty. Organized groups from the North sent thousands of abolitionist supporters to Kansas in an attempt to tip the balance in favor of free state advocates, to counter settlement from proslavery supporters from Missouri. As a result, pro- and antislavery groups had frequent clashes culminating in the Battle of Black Jack.\nOn May 21, 1856, Henry Clay Pate participated with a posse of 750 proslavery forces in the sacking of Lawrence, which destroyed the Free State Hotel, two abolitionist newspaper offices and their printing presses. They also looted throughout the village. The next day, Congressman Preston Brooks from South Carolina physically attacked Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in the Senate chambers with a cane. He continued hitting after the senator was bleeding and unconscious. Three days later, a band of men, led by John Brown and comrade Captain Shore, executed five proslavery men with broadswords at Pottawatomie Creek. Brown's men let Jerome Glanville and James Harris return home to the cabin of Harris. This incident became known as the Pottawatomie massacre. Following the massacre, three antislavery men were taken prisoner, including two of John Brown's sons.\n",

        "paragraph": "Bushwhacking was a form of guerrilla warfare common during the American Revolutionary War, War of 1812, American Civil War and other conflicts in which there were large areas of contested land and few governmental resources to control these tracts. This was particularly prevalent in rural areas during the Civil War where there were sharp divisions between those favoring the Union and Confederacy in the conflict. The perpetrators of the attacks were called bushwhackers. The term \"bushwhacking\" is still in use today to describe ambushes done with the aim of attrition.[1]\nBushwhackers were generally part of the irregular military forces on both sides. While bushwhackers conducted well-organized raids against the military, the most dire of the attacks involved ambushes of individuals and house raids in rural areas. In the countryside, the actions were particularly inflammatory since they frequently amounted to fighting between neighbors, often to settle personal accounts. Since the attackers were non-uniformed, the government response was complicated by trying to decide whether they were legitimate military attacks or criminal actions.\nThe term \"bushwhacker\" came into wide use during the American Civil War (1861\u20131865).[2] It became particularly associated with the pro-Confederate secessionist guerrillas of Missouri, where such warfare was most intense. Guerrilla warfare also wracked Kentucky, Tennessee, northern Georgia, Arkansas, and western Virginia (including the new state of West Virginia), among other locations.[3][4][5]\n",

The Company's ultimate purpose was to transport anti-slavery immigrants into the Kansas Territory. The Company believed that if enough anti-slavery immigrants settled en masse in the newly-opened territory, they would be able to shift the balance of political power in the territory, which in turn would lead to Kansas becoming a free state (rather than a slave state) when it eventually joined the United States.[6][page\u00a0needed] The New England Emigrant Aid Company is noted less for its direct impact than for the psychological impact it had on pro-slavery and anti-slavery elements. Thayer's prediction that the Company would eventually be able to send 20,000 immigrants a year never came to fruition, but it spurred Border Ruffians from nearby Missouri, where slavery was legal, to move to Kansas to ensure its admission to the Union as a slave state. That, in turn, further galvanized Free-Staters and enemies of Slave Power.\nThayer's intention was to capitalize on anti-slavery sentiment in the Northern United States and to send settlers to Kansas to purchase land and build houses, shops, and mills. They could then sell the land at a significant profit and send the proceeds back to Thayer and his investors. At the behest of several investors, who found the notion of profiting from the anti-slavery cause distasteful, the company's model was shifted to that of a benevolent society, and it was renamed the New England Emigrant Aid Company in 1855. While the company achieved neither a profit nor a significant impact on the population of Kansas, it played an important role in the events that would later be termed Bleeding Kansas.\nThe Company was formed in the midst of the sectional crisis that preceded the American Civil War. To the Northern United States, the concept of popular sovereignty, which stated that the population of each new U.S. state should be allowed to decide if it allowed slavery, was an attempt by Southerners to gain power. When the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act threatened to extend popular sovereignty into the new Kansas Territory, Eli Thayer, a second-term Congressman from Massachusetts, hatched the idea of an Emigrant Aid Company in the winter of 1853\u20131854. His primary partners in the venture were Alexander H. Bullock and Edward Everett Hale, and together, they set Thayer's plans in motion on March 5, 1854.[7] Thayer announced the Company at a rally against the impending passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in Worcester on March 11. Shortly thereafter, the Company's charter was approved by the Massachusetts Legislature for up to $5,000,000 in capital.[8][9]\n",

In 1841 he taught school in Missouri, and in 1844 he graduated from the law school of the University of Cincinnati. He was admitted to the bar and practiced law near Xenia, Ohio. He moved to Platte City, Missouri, in 1845, where he continued his law practice and acting career.\n",

He admitted to committing the murders, along with raping some of his victims, but pled not guilty due to claims of insanity. He was found guilty in 1977 and sentenced to life imprisonment. He has been denied parole four times.[1][2]\nBorn on June 29, 1950, Francis Donald Nemechek was the second of three children born to parents George and Nathalie.[3] Little is known about his upbringing, other than he grew up in Trego County and played football in high school.[4] After high school Nemechek enrolled at Goodland Area Vocational-Technical school, where he was described as a top student. Upon completing the school Nemechek applied for a job as a traveling service mechanic, for which he was granted work for.[4] Nemechek later got married, and fathered one son. After some time, the two filed for divorce. He eventually got a new job as a truck driver which his father helped him obtain.[4] Nemechek would continue to live with his parents up until his arrest.[5] Family members would tell the press that mentioning Nemechek's ex-wife would throw him into rage.[4]\nOn December 13, 1974, Nemechek was driving his pickup truck along Interstate 70 near Ogallah when he noticed a red Toyota driving along the same road, which held 19-year-old Diane Lovette, her friend 21-year-old Cheryl Young, and Cheryl's 3-year-old son Guy William Young, all of Fort Madison, Iowa.[6] Brandishing his handgun, Nemechek shot out one of the tires of the Toyota, consequently causing the car to spiral onto the side of the road. Nemechek then parked his truck and ran to the front of the women's vehicle and abducted all three at gunpoint.[6] He drove the trio to a farmhouse owned by an acquaintance named Joseph Faulkner in Graham County, where he shot both Lovette and Young to death, and left Guy unharmed.[7] However, due to the snow and freezing temperatures, Guy would succumb from hypothermia.[6] Later that same day, Cheryl Young's vehicle was found abandoned. A month later, two trappers found the body of Guy Young, and responding officers found the bodies of Cheryl Young and Diane Lovette inside the farmhouse.[8] The killings quickly drew a lot of attention, and in the months it sat unsolved, the case was nicknamed the \"Lovette-Young case\".[9]\n",

Henry Ward Beecher, a financial backer for the town who helped smuggle rifles past pro-slavery forces in crates marked Beecher's Bibles.\nThe town of Wabaunsee was founded in 1855 by a group of about 70 New England emigrants from New Haven, Connecticut who established the Connecticut Kansas Colony, alternatively called the New Haven Colony or the Beecher Rifle Colony.  The settlers were inspired by a sermon given by well-known abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher and Beecher gave money to help supply rifles for the men to defend themselves.  The rifles were smuggled through pro-slavery areas in crates marked \"Beecher's Bibles,\" and consequently the rifles themselves became known as Beecher's Bibles. Wabaunsee was staunchly anti-slavery and became part of the Underground Railroad in late 1856 and helped Lawrence after Quantrill's Raid.[2]\nIn 1862 the Beecher Bible and Rifle Church was completed after four years of construction. The church was built of local limestone by church member Robert Banks, with contrasting stone accents. The overall style is described as Plains Vernacular. The structure  is crowned by a gable roof and a wood bell tower. A central brick chimney vents wood stoves on the perimeter of the church, connecting to the chimney via metal stovepipes. The church is entered through a vestibule that provides access to the choir loft stairs. The main space was divided down the center into men's and women's sides.[2][3]\n",

Named for the city of Lecompton where it was drafted, it was strongly pro-slavery. It never went into effect.\nThe Lecompton Constitution was drafted by pro-slavery advocates and included provisions to protect slaveholding in the state and to exclude free people of color from its bill of rights. Slavery was the subject of Article 7, which protected the right to slave \"property\", and prevented the legislature from emancipating slaves without their owners' consent, and without full compensation to their owners. It was initially approved in a rigged election in December 1857, but overwhelmingly defeated in a second vote in January 1858 by a majority of voters in the Kansas Territory.[1] The rejection of the Lecompton Constitution, and the subsequent admittance of Kansas to the Union as a free state, highlighted the irregular and fraudulent voting practices that had marked earlier efforts by bushwhackers and border ruffians to create a state constitution in Kansas that allowed slavery.\nThe Lecompton Constitution was preceded by the Topeka Constitution and was followed by the Leavenworth and Wyandotte Constitutions, with the Wyandotte becoming the Kansas state constitution.[2] The document was written in response to the anti-slavery position of the 1855 Topeka Constitution of James H. Lane and other free-state advocates.[2] The territorial legislature\u2014which, because of widespread electoral fraud consisted, mostly of slave owners\u2014met at the designated capital of Lecompton in September 1857 to produce a rival document.[2] Free-state supporters, who comprised a large majority of actual settlers, boycotted the vote. President James Buchanan's appointee as territorial governor of Kansas, Robert J. Walker, although a strong defender of slavery, opposed the blatant injustice of the Constitution and resigned rather than implement it.[3] This new constitution enshrined slavery in the proposed state and protected the rights of slaveholders. In addition, the constitution provided for a referendum that allowed voters the choice of allowing more slaves to enter the territory.\n",

The Bondi and Benjamin homesteads were near the forks of Mosquito Creek northwest of Dutch Henry's Crossing (Lane, Kansas).[4]\nSome sources claim that, as Free Soilers who hated slavery, their farm was attacked and burned by \"Border Ruffians\" (pro-slavers), and that a neighboring farmer, John Brown, rushed to their aide with his sons. However, Bondi recounts in his autobiography that he first met Brown's sons when their herd of Devon cattle wandered onto his farm, and he first met John Brown while traveling to elect a delegate to the 1855 Free State Constitutional Convention.[4] The Brown family did help to evict a pro-slavery squatter from Bondi's claim while he was in St. Louis in January 1856, and Bondi's farm was burned while he was away guarding pro-slavery prisoners captured during the Battle of Black Jack in June 1856.[4]\n",

By 1864 Quantrill had lost control of the group, which split up into small bands. Some, including Quantrill, were killed in various engagements.

The name derives from the term \"free state\", that is, a U.S. state without slavery. Many of the \"free-staters\" joined the Jayhawkers in their fight against slavery and to make Kansas a free state.\nMany Free-Staters were abolitionists from New England, in part because there was an organized emigration of settlers to Kansas Territory arranged by the New England Emigrant Aid Company beginning in 1854.  Other Free-Staters were abolitionists who came to Kansas Territory from Ohio, Iowa, and other midwestern states.  Holton, Kansas was named for the Milwaukee, Wisconsin free-stater Edward Dwight Holton.[1]\nWhat united the Free-Staters was a desire to defeat the southern, pro-slavery settlers in Kansas Territory on the question of whether Kansas would be admitted to the Union as a slave state. (The Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act of 1854 had left the question open to the settlers in the territory.)[2][3] Bastions for the free-state movement in Kansas included major towns and cities like Lawrence, Eudora, Baldwin City, Osawatomie, Ozawkie, Burlingame, Mound City and Topeka, among others.[4][5]\nAs time passed and the violence in Bleeding Kansas escalated, the Free-State movement became more popular. In 1858, the Free-Staters proposed a second constitution, the Leavenworth Constitution, which banned slavery and also would have given the right to vote to black men, though this constitution also failed because the US Senate did not ratify it.[6][7] Kansas became a state January 29, 1861 after a free state constitution (from a conference in Wyandotte in 1859) was adopted.[7] The Confederate States of America seceded in the next month and Jefferson Davis was sworn in as their president February 18, 1861.\n",

At the age of ten years he was sent to Newport, New Hampshire, to attend a preparatory school before entering Dartmouth College. Disliking the rigid discipline enforced at the preparatory school, he ran away. He had no money nor acquaintance in New Hampshire, but managed to reach Lowell, Massachusetts, where he went to work on the Advertiser.  Knowing that if discovered by his parents he would be obliged to return to the preparatory school, he did not communicate with them for a period of five years, during which time he remained steadily at his post at the Advertiser, learning all the details of the printing business. When he learned that his family had moved to Missouri, he joined them there in 1848, and for four years was employed as salesman in a mercantile house.\nIn 1852 Kelley started a Democratic newspaper at Liberty, Missouri, called the Democratic Platform, and continued its publication until the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, when he discontinued the Platform and established a pro-slavery paper in Atchison, Kansas, called the Squatter Sovereign. Dr. J. H. Stringfellow joined Kelley in this venture as partner and associate editor. This was in 1855, during the intense excitement attending the settlement of Kansas and Nebraska. The paper was the leading organ of the Democratic party in Kansas, and was strongly pro-Southern and pro-slavery. Concerning his experience at the time, Kelley said: \"There was no such thing as concession at the time. We were all extremists, whether advocating or opposing slavery.

It was named after the long defunct Oread Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, where many of the settlers of Lawrence moved from prior to the American Civil War.  The hill was originally called Hogback Ridge by many Lawrence residents until the Oread name was adopted in 1864, two years after the university was founded.[2]\nFor settlers going westward by wagon train on the Oregon Trail, \"The Hill\", as Mount Oread is now commonly referred to by Kansans, was the next big topographical challenge after crossing the Wakarusa River, which is today located two miles south of the city of Lawrence.\nJames Lane and Governor Charles Robinson erected a fort on the hill in the 1850s, during the Bleeding Kansas conflict in order to protect Lawrence. A 1857 Harper's Weekly report deemed the fort to be valueless as a military work. Governor Robinson's first home in Lawrence would be built on the hill, which was burned down on May 21st, 1855 by pro-slavery border ruffians.[3]\n",

The Stubbs had a membership of 60 on their absorption into the Union Army.\nThe Stubbs also took on the title of the Oread Guards after the Oread Institute donated waterproof coats.[1][2]\nFounded as the Kansas Rifles No. 1 on 16 April 1855, the Lawrence-based militia consisted of two companies each approximately 50 soldiers in size. Armed with Sharps rifles and Colt revolvers, the militia was organized for the purpose of defending Free State voters and to defend Lawrence from pro-slavery forces. To accomplish this, they drilled daily.[3] They were officially granted a charter and reorganized as the Stubbs on 9 February 1858,[4] a nickname they had accrued because of some members' short stature.[3]\n",

Originally from Pennsylvania, the family is believed to have murdered 11 wealthy travelers, akin to the Bloody Benders a decade earlier.[1]\nVigilantes hunted down and killed the fleeing family in order to make an example of them. William confessed to all of the family's crimes before being hanged from a tree.[1]\nAccording to 55-year-old William Kelly's confession, he and his family moved from the Pennsylvania mountains to Kansas in 1869. They moved around to different places along the southern border until eventually settling in No Man's Land, around 25 miles away from Beaver, Oklahoma. Initially dealing with cattle, the Kellys soon opened a tavern, where they housed fellow cattlers and travelers.[1] Although illiterate, they were regarded as an ordinary working family, with nobody harboring any suspicion towards them.[2]\n",

The unit was first created during World War I, and was later reactivated during World War II. When the Kansas National Guard was federalized and deployed during each of the world wars, the state of Kansas was forced to raise and maintain its own military force in order to protect against saboteurs, quell riots, and perform other duties which would normally fall to the National Guard. Unlike the National Guard, which could be federalized and deployed abroad, the State Guard was funded and equipped solely by the state and as such was immune to deployment. The Kansas State Guard is authorized under Kansas law.[1] In 2007, the Kansas Legislature considered a bill which would create a modern Kansas State Defense Force.[2] The bill did not pass.\nPrior to the Militia Act of 1903, which reorganized state militias into the National Guard of the United States, each state maintained its own militia, which could be used to supplement the full-time military in times of war.\nAfter Kansas was opened for settlement in 1854, conflict broke out between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions. The first official militia of Kansas was created to pursue a band of men, who had broken an anti-slavery suspect out of a pro-slavery sheriff's custody into the town of Lawrence, Kansas. The sheriff informed the governor that the town of Lawrence, by refusing to turn over the suspects, was in a state of insurrection. The militia, however, was largely composed of men from Missouri from the pro-slavery faction. Anti-slavery activists, fearing the Missourians would use this government order as an excuse to destroy the largely anti-slavery town, formed their own militias and fortified the town. What would become known as the Wakarusa War, the bloodless siege ended when the governor arrived and a treaty between the factions was negotiated, and the Missouri militia was disbanded and returned home.[3]\n",

The attack was in retaliation for a speech given by Sumner two days earlier in which he fiercely criticized slaveholders, including pro-slavery South Carolina Senator Andrew Butler, a relative of Brooks. The beating nearly killed Sumner and contributed significantly to the country's polarization over the issue of slavery. It has been considered symbolic of the \"breakdown of reasoned discourse\"[1] and the use of violence that eventually led to the Civil War.\nAlthough Sumner was unable to return to the Senate until December 1859,[2] the Massachusetts legislature refused to replace him, leaving his empty desk in the Senate as a public reminder of the attack.\nIn 1856, during the \"Bleeding Kansas\" crisis, Sumner denounced the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in his \"Crime against Kansas\" speech, delivered on May 19 and May 20. The long speech argued for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state and went on to denounce the \"Slave Power\"\u2014the political arm of the slave owners:\n",

During the partisan warfare in Kansas Territory in 1856 commonly known as Bleeding Kansas, a colony of Southerners, possibly all Georgians, established New Georgia. This colony was located on the Marias des Cygnes River. A blockhouse fort was constructed there and entrenchments were begun but the fort destroyed before the entrenchments could be completed. Northern settlers in the area claimed settlers at New Georgia harassed them. In reality, some settlers from both the North and South had groups who caused trouble with their neighbors.[1]\nAugust Bondi and Dr. Rufus Gilpatrick spied on New Georgia during two trips taken in July and August 1856. During August the Free-State Northerners decided to take action against four Southern strongholds in the area to help put an end to the pro-slavery cause in Kansas. Southern partisans wanted Kansas admitted to the Union as a slave state. From period sources, it is not completely clear how a Free-State group of men took possession of New Georgia's fort. It is known of the four forts taken, New Georgia was the first to fall.[2][3][4][5]\n",

He was born in Culpeper County, Virginia, son of Robert Stringfellow, a farmer, veteran of the War of 1812, merchant at Raccoon Ford on the Rapidan River, and Mary Plunkett, daughter of an early industrialist in Orange County, Virginia.[1] Benjamin Franklin Stringfellow was his younger brother. He was educated at Caroline Academy, Va., Columbia University, and graduated from the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania in 1845. Soon after that he located at Carrollton, Missouri, where he married Ophelia J. Simmons, niece of Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards.\nDuring the cholera epidemic of 1849, when every boat coming up the river unloaded cholera patients, he converted a large warehouse into a hospital and devoted three months to caring for them. In 1852 he removed to Platte City. Upon the organization of Kansas Territory in 1854 he crossed the Missouri River, selected a claim, and in connection with some friends formed a town company which laid out the town of Atchison. In 1854 he brought his family and lived in Atchison until 1858. He was the founder and editor of the pro-slavery Squatter Sovereign, the first newspaper in Atchison, and was commissioned colonel of the Third regiment of the territorial militia by Gov. Shannon. He was called to Virginia by the death of his father in 1858 and was detained there until after the opening of the Civil War. He entered the Confederate service as captain of a Virginia company, but was at once detailed as surgeon and acted in that capacity only. In 1871 he returned to Atchison and remained there until 1876. He then moved to St. Joseph, Missouri, where he died on July 24, 1905.[2]\n",

Anti-slavery Lawrence became the de facto capital during the latter part of this period, when the county seat was moved there.

Lecompton was a hotbed of pro-slavery sentiment during the mid-1800s.\nLecompton was founded in 1854, on a bluff on the south bank of the Kansas River. It was originally called \"Bald Eagle\", but the name was changed to Lecompton in honor of Samuel Lecompte, the chief justice of the territorial Supreme Court.[5] In August 1855, the city became the capital of the Kansas Territory after President Franklin Pierce appointed Andrew Horatio Reeder as governor and charged him and his officials with establishing government offices in Lecompton.[6] The city soon became a stronghold of pro-slavery politics and Southern sympathy, which put it in conflict with nearby Lawrence, which had been founded by Free-Staters from Massachusetts.\nThe first post office in Lecompton was established in September, 1855.[7] The city served as the seat of Douglas County, until 1858, when it was moved to Lawrence.\n",

After the Civil War, the word \"Jayhawker\" became synonymous with the people of Kansas, or anybody born in Kansas.[1] Today a modified version of the term, Jayhawk, is used as a nickname for a native-born Kansan,[2][3][4]\nThe origin of the term \"Jayhawker\" may go back as far as the Revolutionary War, when it was reportedly used to describe a group associated with American Founding Father John Jay, who was also the First Chief Justice of the United States. Jay believed in the abolition of slavery and that America should be governed by Christians; he has been described by historians as a \"Christian Nationalist\" and \"among the most orthodox of Christians,\" according to Cambridge University and Oxford University professor Daniel Dreisbach.[5][6] In 1816, Jay wrote, \"Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.\"[7] In 1776, prior to America's founding, Jay condemned slavery as a moral evil, and would be quoted as saying, \"The Holy Gospels are yet to be preached to these western regions, and we have the highest reason to believe that the Almighty will not suffer slavery and the gospel to go hand in hand. It cannot, it will not be.\"[7]\nBecause of his positions on the immorality of slavery and the need for Christianity in government, many dubbed the political and militia groups that arose over the next century that were largely Christian and militantly anti-slavery as \"Jayhawkers.\"[8]\n",

The book's production costs were covered by prominent antislavery philanthropist Gerrit Smith.[citation needed]\nIn 1855, Redpath moved to the Kansas-Missouri border and reported for a Free Soil newspaper, the Missouri Democrat, on the dispute over slavery in Kansas Territory. For the next three years, he was active in Kansas affairs, engaging in politics, writing dispatches, securing support in New England for Free Soil settlers, and writing poetry about Kansas. In 1856, he interviewed John Brown just days after the massacre at Pottawatomie Creek. Redpath and Brown shared the same abolitionist views, and he became Brown's most fervent publicist.

        "paragraph": "The Slave Power, or Slavocracy, referred to the perceived political power in the U.S. federal government held by slave owners during the 1840s and 1850s, prior to the Civil War.[1] Antislavery campaigners, led by Frederick Douglass, during this period bitterly decried what they saw as disproportionate and corrupt influence wielded by wealthy Southerners.  The argument was that this small group of rich slave owners had seized political control of their own states and were trying to take over the federal government in an illegitimate fashion in order to expand and protect slavery. The argument was later widely used by the Republican Party that formed in 1854\u201355 to oppose the expansion of slavery.\nThe main issue expressed by the term slave power was distrust of the political power of the slave-owning class. Such distrust was shared by many who were not abolitionists; those who were motivated more by a possible threat to the political balance or the impossibility of competing with unwaged slave labor, than by concern over the treatment of slaves. Those who differed on many other issues (such as hating Black people or liking them, denouncing slavery as a sin or promising to guarantee its protection in the Deep South) could unite to attack the slavocracy.[2] The \"Free Soil\" element emphasized that rich slave owners would move into new territory, use their cash to buy up all the good lands, then use their slaves to work the lands, leaving little opportunity room for free farmers. By 1854, the Free Soil Party had largely merged into the new Republican Party.[3]\nThe term was popularized by antislavery writers such as Frederick Douglass, John Gorham Palfrey, Josiah Quincy III, Horace Bushnell, James Shepherd Pike, and Horace Greeley. Politicians who emphasized the theme included John Quincy Adams, Henry Wilson and William Pitt Fessenden. Abraham Lincoln used the concept after 1854 but not the term. They showed, through a combination of emotive argument and hard statistical data, that the South had long held a disproportionate level of power in the United States.\n",

The incident occurred north of Pottawatomie Creek, near its junction to Mosquito Creek, in Franklin County, Kansas.

Doy and his 19-year-old son Charles were fellow abolitionists who had been arrested by pro-slavery Missouri bounty hunters while trying to deliver slaves to freedom in the Nebraska Territory via the Underground Railroad. While his son was acquitted of the charges and released, John was sentenced to prison. The ten men who took it upon themselves to rescue Doy were led by Major James B. Abbott and included Doy's son Charles, George R. Hay, Silas Soule, Capt. John E. Stewart, S.J. Willis, Thomas Simmons, Joseph Gardner, Jacob Senix, and Captain Joshua A. Pike.[1] The episode occurred during a period of violent interstate ideological conflict preceding the American Civil War known as \"Bleeding Kansas\".\nOn January 25, 1859, the Doys were passing through Lawrence, Kansas en route to the Nebraska Territory with thirteen slaves. John and Charles were just 12 miles outside of Lawrence when they were caught and surrounded by a group of armed pro-slavery \"Border Ruffians\" who had come from Missouri (a slave state) for the purpose of capturing escaped slaves and stopping activity on the Underground Railroad. When confronted, John was threatened to be killed on the spot. All that he asked was that they did not fire toward the carriage, since there were women and children inside. The option of fighting back was not in the Doys' favor as they were greatly outnumbered. Both John and Charles were arrested and thrown in jail temporarily until their trial on March 20, 1859, in St. Joseph, Missouri. Charles was eventually cleared of all charges, but the jury could not agree on a verdict for John and he was tried a second time. At the second trial, Dr. Doy was convicted of abducting slaves and sentenced to five years in the Missouri State Penitentiary.\nIn the summer of 1859, while Dr. Doy was imprisoned in the St. Joseph jail, Major James B. Abbott put together a crew of ten men to rescue him. The plan was carried out on July 23. Two of the men pretended to be bounty hunters who had caught a horse thief (who was also part of the crew) and distracted the guards while the rest of the men overtook the prison and went after Doy. Doy was found very ill and unable to walk due to exhaustion and disease, so a couple of the men carried him out. A famous ambrotype photograph of the Immortal Ten was taken in Lawrence by photographer Amon Gilbert DaLee shortly after the rescue. It depicts the whole crew together while Doy is sitting in a chair in the front, unable to stand on his own.\n",

It was drafted by Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas, passed by the 33rd United States Congress, and signed into law by President Franklin Pierce. Douglas introduced the bill intending to open up new lands to develop and facilitate the construction of a transcontinental railroad, but the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act is most notable for effectively repealing the Missouri Compromise, stoking national tensions over slavery, and contributing to a series of armed conflicts known as \"Bleeding Kansas\".\nThe United States had acquired vast amounts of land in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, and since the 1840s Douglas had sought to establish a territorial government in a portion of the Louisiana Purchase that was still unorganized. Douglas's efforts were stymied by Senator David Rice Atchison and other Southern leaders who refused to allow the creation of territories that banned slavery; slavery would have been banned because the Missouri Compromise outlawed slavery in the territory north of latitude 36\u00b030' north (except for Missouri). To win the support of Southerners like Atchison, Pierce and Douglas agreed to back the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, with the status of slavery instead decided based on \"popular sovereignty\". Under popular sovereignty, the citizens of each territory, rather than Congress, would determine whether slavery would be allowed.[1]\nDouglas's bill to repeal the Missouri Compromise and organize Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory won approval by a wide margin in the Senate, but faced stronger opposition in the House of Representatives. Though Northern Whigs strongly opposed the bill, the bill passed the House with the support of almost all Southerners and some Northern Democrats. After the passage of the act, pro- and anti-slavery elements flooded into Kansas to establish a population that would vote for or against slavery, resulting in a series of armed conflicts known as \"Bleeding Kansas\".[2] Douglas and Pierce hoped that popular sovereignty would help bring an end to the national debate over slavery, but the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act outraged Northerners. The division between pro-slavery and anti-slavery forces caused by the Act was the death knell for the ailing Whig Party, which broke apart after the Act. Its Northern remnants would give rise to the anti-slavery Republican Party. The Act, and the tensions over slavery it inflamed, were key events leading to the American Civil War.\n",

In 1865 the state donated to the university 13 acres of land that included the foundation of what had been intended to be the Kansas Territorial Capitol building at Lecompton. A college building was erected on the south half of the old foundation in 1882.\nThe Church of the United Brethren in Christ owned and controlled the school during its entire history.

In 2004, the Kansas Supreme Court overturned the state's death penalty law, but the Kansas Attorney General appealed to the US Supreme Court, which upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty in Kansas. On July 25, 2014, the Kansas Supreme Court again overturned the Carrs' death sentences on a legal technicality relating to their original trial judge not giving each brother a separate penalty proceeding.[3] After an appeal by the state's attorney general to the US Supreme Court, it overturned the decision of the Kansas Supreme Court in January 2016 and reinstated the death sentences.[4] The Carr brothers are incarcerated on death row at El Dorado Correctional Facility.\n",

The country would have been centered in Havana and would have consisted of the Southern United States and a \"golden circle\" of territories in Mexico (which was to be divided into 25 new slave states), Central America, northern parts of South America, and Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and most other islands in the Caribbean, about 2,400 miles (3,900\u00a0km) in diameter.[1][2]\nOriginally, the KGC advocated that the new territories should be annexed by the United States, in order to vastly increase the number of slave states and thus the power of the slave-holding Southern upper classes. In response to the increased anti-slavery agitation that followed the Dred Scott decision (1857) the Knights changed their position: the Southern United States should secede, forming their own confederation, and then invade and annex the area of the Golden Circle to vastly expand the power of the South.[3] In the United States, the new country's northern border would roughly coincide with the Mason\u2013Dixon line, and within it were included such cities as Washington, D.C., St. Louis, Mexico City, and Panama City.\nThe KGC's proposal grew out of previous unsuccessful proposals to annex Cuba (Ostend Manifesto), parts of Central America (Filibuster War), and all of Mexico (All of Mexico Movement). In Cuba, the issue was complicated by the desire of many in the colony for independence from Spain.[citation needed] Mexico and Central America had no interest in being part of the United States.[citation needed]\n",

The murder was the culmination of a long-simmering feud between the two, as for some time they had argued about a land claim near Hickory Point, located about 14 miles (23\u00a0km) south of Lawrence.[1] According to the Border War Encyclopedia, \"Politics had not motivated Coleman to kill Dow, but the murder marked the genesis of the violent political divisions that characterized Kansas for the next 10 years.\"[2]\n",

After an 1856 article in the New-York Tribune carried a quote by Henry Ward Beecher, the Sharps Carbines became known as Beecher's Bibles.[2]\nFor decades there had been a conflict between pro-slavery and anti-slavery activists in America. Before Missouri asked to be admitted to the United States there were 11 free and 11 slave states. Missouri was admitted as a slave state and Maine was admitted as a free state. The 1820 Missouri Compromise stated that all states south of Missouri could be admitted as slave states. In 1854 Congress initiated the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act which said voters could decide. Settlers from both sides came to Kansas. Violence was common between the two sides in Kansas.

Beecher believed that such weapons were, \"a greater moral urgency among border ruffians than the scriptures\".[4]\nThe name \"Beecher's Bibles\" in reference to Sharps rifles and carbines was inspired by the comments and activities of the abolitionist New England minister Henry Ward Beecher,[5] of the New England Emigrant Aid Society, of whom it was written in a February 8, 1856, article in the New-York Tribune:[6] Beecher was an outspoken abolitionist and he raised funds to buy weapons for Kansas free state settlers.

During the \"Bleeding Kansas\" period, the fort was the site of two minor battles between pro- and anti-slavery factions.\nFranklin was a small town established in 1854 in Douglas County, Kansas Territory. It was established by settlers, mostly from the nation's south, who wanted the territory admitted to the Union as a slave state. By late 1855 Franklin had about a dozen homes and businesses and a post office. It became a center devoted to the southern cause in Kansas.[1] By May 1856 a blockhouse was built inside Franklin, which was used to store arms and the \"Old Sacramento Cannon\", which had been seized during a raid on the Liberty, Missouri arsenal. The blockhouse was built to be defended in the event of attack by forces from Lawrence.[2][3]\nTwo attacks were made on Franklin's fort during summer 1856. The first attack was made on June 4 by about fifteen members of the Stubbs, a free-state militia based in Lawrence. The free-staters entered town after dark to search for \"Old Sacramento Cannon,\" which had been taken during a southern raid on Lawrence. Some sleeping defenders at the fort were aroused by noise and what was termed the First Battle of Franklin erupted. The cannon was fired once without injuring any free-staters. Town residents shot from their houses at the free-staters, town, forcing their retreat. One Franklin man was killed and a few persons were wounded. Some Franklin men may have been captured by the Lawrence men.[4][5]\n",

These clashes further escalated and become a part of the greater conflict known as Bleeding Kansas. With the admission of Kansas into the Union as a free state in 1861, violence began to dissipate. Peace continued to elude Olathe for many years to come, however. In 1861, Union officials and local military forces created a military post in the city.

On May 19, 1858, during a period of political instability and sporadic violence known as Bleeding Kansas, a group of pro-slavery border ruffians captured 11 abolitionist free-staters.  The prisoners were forced to a nearby ravine, where 10 of them were shot, resulting in five fatalities.  The abolitionist John Brown later built a fort near the site.  The first commemoration at the site was two stone markers erected by men of the 3rd Iowa Cavalry Regiment in 1864, although these monuments had been destroyed by souvenir hunters by 1895.  In 1941, the land where the massacre occurred, as well as an 1870s-era house constructed by a friend of Brown, were transferred to the state of Kansas.  The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974.  The Kansas Historical Society administers the site, which is interpreted by signage and a hand-cranked audio recording.\nWhen the United States Congress passed the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act in 1854, it did not directly state whether Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory would allow slavery or not.  While Nebraska did not see much controversy, Kansas became a hotly debated area.  While the previous Missouri Compromise would have prevented slavery from being practiced in Kansas, the new law left the question open.[2]  In response to the new opening, pro-slavery advocates known as border ruffians, many of whom were from Missouri, entered Kansas to illegally vote in an attempt to sway local elections.  The New England Emigrant Aid Company also sought to bring anti-slavery settlers into the territory.  The elections, which were held on March 30, 1855, resulted in a pro-slavery majority in the Kansas territorial government, who in turn created laws protecting slavery and, among other things, outlawing abolitionist literature.  Abolitionist sentiment was strong near Lawrence, and several prominent Lawrence residents formed the Free State Party to organize resistance to the pro-slavery government in September.  In October, free-staters drafted the Topeka Constitution, which sought to create an abolitionist government in the state.  There were now both pro- and anti-slavery governments vying for control of Kansas; President of the United States Franklin Pierce supported the pro-slavery government as the lawful one.[2][3]\n",

Douglas had previously defeated Lincoln in the 1858 United States Senate election in Illinois, known for the pivotal Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates. He was one of the brokers of the Compromise of 1850 which sought to avert a sectional crisis; to further deal with the volatile issue of extending slavery into the territories, Douglas became the foremost advocate of popular sovereignty, which held that each territory should be allowed to determine whether to permit slavery within its borders. This attempt to address the issue was rejected by both pro-slavery and anti-slavery advocates. Douglas was nicknamed the \"Little Giant\" because he was short in physical stature but a forceful and dominant figure in politics.\nBorn in Brandon, Vermont, Douglas migrated to Jacksonville, Illinois, in 1833 to establish a legal practice. He experienced early success in politics as a member of the newly formed Democratic Party, serving in the Illinois House of Representatives and various other positions. He resigned from the Supreme Court of Illinois upon being elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1843. Douglas became an ally of President James K. Polk, and favored the annexation of Texas and the Mexican\u2013American War.

Most of the settlers of the early community were abolitionists or Free-Staters from New England, and consequently, they opposed the extension of slavery into Kansas Territory.[4][5]\nIn 1859, Annie Soule and Martha Cutter helped found a library (and an associated book club), in the hopes that it \"would contribute to the 'moral, social, and intellectual improvement of [the settlement's] members\";[5] specifically, they hoped \"to prevent dancing from becoming the only amusement in the community.\"[3] The library initially boasted a collection 10 books (which eventually grew to over 2,000), and residents of the small town were allowed to check them out if they contributed an annual fee of 50 cents.[6][7] The building that currently holds the collection was constructed in 1900 when the community's book supply grew too large.[7] Today, Coal Creek Library is considered the oldest subscription library in the state.[5]\n",

Eventually, after Bernard was convinced to leave the settlement, St. Bernard developed into Minneola.

After Kansas free-state voters overcame the pro-slavery faction in 1857, the government voted against naming Centropolis as the capital of Kansas, since the town had pro-slavery leanings.[1] However, the new free-state government still wished to move the territorial capital from Lecompton, and so the legislature convened at Lawrence to decide a new location.

Free soilers, they arrived in western Douglas County, Kansas, in July 1854, one month after the territory was opened to settlement. They built a large log house to serve primarily as their living quarters. It had six rooms and was 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) west of the free-state stronghold of Lawrence, Kansas. For protection the family built loop holes for guns into the sides of the house.[1]\nWakefield became the justice of the Squatters' Court, when it was organized August 26, 1854. Because of his position, he was thereafter known as Judge Wakefield. He tried cases involving both northern and southern settlers and until spring 1856 both groups got along without much trouble. That spring southern partisans in the area began a picket of men assigned to watch the house. In August 1856 much trouble erupted between the free-state men and the southern men in eastern Kansas. Free-state men at times garrisoned Judge Wakefield's house. At 2 A.M. on August 16 southern partisans, including Henry T. Titus, attacked the fortress home, but they were unable to take it. Later that day free-state men attacked and destroy the fortress home of Titus, called Fort Titus.[2]\nThe southern partisans sought retaliation for their string of defeats in August, when not only Fort Titus, but New Georgia's fort, Franklin's Fort and Fort Saunders were all taken by free-state partisans. On the night of September 1, 1856, the southerners burned six houses and one other building, including Judge Wakefield's house. The family lost all their possessions.[3]\n",

An obituary called him \"a singularly unhappy man\".[1]\nAt the age of fifteen he began to write verses, and two years later he became amanuensis to a lady in Brighton. A traveling lecturer on phrenology recited some of young Realf's poems, as illustrations of ideality, and thereupon several literary people in Brighton sought him out and encouraged him. Under their patronage a collection of his poems was published, entitled \"Guesses at the Beautiful\" (London, 1852). Realf spent a year in Leicestershire, studying scientific agriculture, and in 1854 came to the United States.\nAfter arriving in the U.S., Realf explored the slums of New York City, became a Five Points missionary, and assisted in establishing there a course of cheap lectures and a self-improvement association. In 1856 he accompanied a party of free-state emigrants to Kansas, where he became a journalist and correspondent of several Eastern newspapers. He made the acquaintance of John Brown, accompanied him to Chatham, Ontario, Canada, and was to be Secretary of State in the provisional government that Brown projected. The movement being deferred for two years, Realf made a visit to England and a tour in the Southern states. When Brown made his attack on Harpers Ferry in October 1859, Realf was in Texas, where he was arrested and sent to Washington, D.C., being in imminent danger of lynching on the way.[1][2]\n",

The largest issue by far in territorial Kansas was whether slavery was to be permitted or prohibited; aside from the moral question, which at the time was seen as a religious question, the admission of Kansas to the highly polarized Union would help either the pro- or anti-slavery faction in Congress. As a procedure for resolving the issue, Congress accepted the proposal of Senator Stephen A. Douglas, that the question be settled by popular sovereignty: the residents of the territory would decide the question by vote. This did not work, because there was no accepted definition of who was a resident of the territory and could therefore vote. Hoping to make Kansas a slave state, thousands of \"Border Ruffians\" from the neighboring slave state of Missouri poured into Kansas, some with the intent to live in Kansas, but more planning to return to Missouri as soon as they had voted. The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society and similar groups sponsored free-state farmers who would move to Kansas. The most famous of these was John Brown, who told the free-state Kansans that violence was unfortunately necessary if Kansas were to be a free state. He put this into practice himself at the Pottawatomie massacre of 1856. As it was put later by his son John Brown, Jr., \"only force and fire-arms kept slavery out of Kansas\".[1]\nThe upshot was that there were sizeable pro- and anti-slavery factions in Kansas, although the former were more numerous, if one accepted at face value their claim to be genuine Kansas residents. The result was duelling constitutions: for several years Kansas had two governments, in two different cities (Lecompton and Lawrence), with two constitutions, one pro- and one anti-slavery, each claiming to be the only legitimate government of the entire territory.\n",

Even there, his new family moved across numerous states before finally settling in Kansas state.[2] Details of his childhood are not exactly known, but after his family moved to Leavenworth in the mid-1970s, Grissom enrolled at Leavenworth High School, where he gained popularity as a friendly, good looking, and smart kid who regularly got As and Bs and was a halfback for his school's football team.[2]\nOn the morning of January 27, 1977, Grissom left his home after an argument with his parents.[2] Sometime after leaving, he stole a railroad spike, which he used to break into the home of his neighbor, 72-year-old Hazel Meeker. In the house he attacked Meeker, viciously beating her until her death, then left the house. Meeker's granddaughter, Carla, went to visit her grandmother, but found her dead body in a pool of blood.[4] She contacted the police who showed up and conducted an investigation. Police discovered that there were footprints in the snow all around the house, and they subsequently followed the trail which led them to the southern railroad tracks.[4] They continued to follow them until they ended right where Grissom was hiding in a trailer park. When they noticed him, Grissom attempted to bury a handgun he had stolen from another home under the snow, but police handcuffed him before he could.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Bender family, more well known as the Bloody Benders, were a family of serial killers who lived and operated in Labette County, Kansas, United States, from May 1871 to December 1872.[1] The family consisted of John Bender, his wife Elvira and their son John\u00a0Jr. and daughter Kate. While popular retelling of the story holds that John\u00a0Jr. and Kate were siblings, contemporary newspapers reported that several of the Benders' neighbors had stated that they claimed to be married, possibly in a common law marriage.\nWhile there is no definitive number, estimates report that the Benders killed at least a dozen travelers before their crimes were discovered. The fate of the family remains unknown, with theories ranging from a lynching of the family to a successful escape. Much folklore and legend surrounds the Benders, making it difficult to separate fact from fiction.\nIn October 1870, five families of spiritualists homesteaded in and around the township of Osage in northwestern Labette County, approximately 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) northeast of where Cherryvale was established seven months later. One of the families was John Bender\u00a0Sr. and John Bender\u00a0Jr., who registered 160 acres (65\u00a0ha) of land located adjacent to the Great Osage Trail, which was then the only open road for traveling farther west. After a cabin, a barn with a corral, and a well were built, in the fall of 1871, Elvira Bender and daughter Kate arrived, and the cabin was divided into two rooms by a canvas wagon-cover. The Benders used the smaller room at the rear for living quarters, while the front room was converted into a \"general store\" where a few dry goods were sold. The front section also contained the kitchen and dining table, where travelers could stop for a meal or even spend the night. Elvira and Kate Bender also planted a 2-acre (0.81\u00a0ha) vegetable garden and apple orchard north of the cabin.[1][2][3]\n",

        "paragraph": "Fort Bain (also called \"Fort Bourbon\") was a log house in the Kansas Territory built in 1857 by John Brown and his associate Captain Oliver P. Bain (or Baynes).[1]  The house was located in northern Bourbon County, on the north side of the Osage River 1.5 miles due east of Fort Lincoln, approximately seven miles from the border with Missouri, near the present town of Fulton.[2]\nThe house was used as a rendezvous point for both John Brown and James Montgomery throughout 1857-58 during the Bleeding Kansas troubles, and was also a point on the Underground Railroad.  Although no contemporary illustrations or photographs of the house have been located, it was described by Brown as being substantial and capable of housing 50 men.[citation needed]\nOn December 16, 1857, a small number of men who identified themselves as a \"Squatter's Court\" defended the house against an armed posse of about 50 men led by United States Deputy Marshal Little from Fort Scott.[3]  Upon the arrival of Little's force, a parley ensued, but ended without resolution.  Little advanced on the house and four of his men were wounded.  Retreating and regrouping, Little and ten men attempted a second attack on Fort Bain, which was also unsuccessful but without any casualties.  Little and his men then returned to Fort Scott.  Little returned on December 17 with 150 men and found that Fort Bain had been abandoned by the Free Staters.[4]\n",

He was also a Democrat and a political leader who was a president of the Unione Siciliana and was involved in a heated battle for alderman. D'Andrea was killed by an assassin's bullet in 1921.\nD'Andrea was born in Valledolmo, Sicily, in 1872 to a large family, he studied law at the University of Palermo in Palermo, Sicily. In 1897, D'Andrea immigrated to the United States, briefly settling in Buffalo, New York. He later attended seminary at St. Mary's Academy in Baltimore and St. Bonaventura's Academy in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. In June, 1899, D'Andrea moved to Chicago, where he was ordained a priest and appointed pastor of St. Anthony's Italian (Independent) Catholic Church under Bishop Antoni Kozlowski\u00a0[pl]. His brother Orazio (Horace) also became a priest.\nIn Chicago, D'Andrea met a young German woman, Carolina \"Lena\" Wagner. D'Andrea fell in love with Lena, left the priesthood, and married her in Milwaukee. However, after their marriage, Lena suddenly disappeared. D'Andrea suspected that the people who sheltered Lena after her parents' deaths were holding her. With help from the police, D'Andrea and Lena were reunited. Now that he was no longer a priest, D'Andrea decided to become a teacher of modern languages. His brother Louis also left the priesthood and married.[1]\n",

His adoptive parents proved to be very strict and frequently beat him, leading the young Miller to develop anger issues and engage in petty crime from an early age.\nBetween the late 1960s and 1977, he was arrested a total of 11 times on charges such as theft, carjacking and sexual assault, but would always get away with a short stint in prison after accepting plea deals from the prosecutors. In the early 1970s, Miller left Chicago and lived in various locations including the cities of Bloomington and Waukegan, and even the state of Virginia. By 1977, he had permanently settled in Skokie, where he had married a local woman and worked as a pizza delivery man.[2]\n",

Edgar Hoover, then recently appointed Director of the FBI, it was one of the first major investigations by the agency, who were led by Durkin on a three-month chase through five states before his capture in 1926.[2]\nIn late 1925, Durkin came under investigation by federal authorities for violation of the Dyer Act. A professional car thief, the 25-year-old was suspected of transporting stolen cars across state lines. On October 11, 1925, Durkin was followed to a Chicago garage by federal Special Agent Edwin C. Shanahan. When Shanahan approached the car Durkin was in he surprised him and Durkin shot him in the chest. The story received instant national attention because Shanahan was the first federal agent to be killed in the line of duty .[2]\nThe reaction from the FBI was particularly aggressive and widely considered \"a matter of pride and personal security\" among virtually the entire agency. According to popular lore, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover called an aide to his office after hearing news of Shanahan's death and said \"We've got to get Durkin. If one man from the Bureau is killed, and the killer is permitted to get away, our agents will never be safe. We can't let him get away with it.\"[2]\n",

This murderous campaign resulted in 20 deaths and hundreds wounded (Viana was suspected in at least 15 murders alone). Cardinelli's organization would remain the leading Italian-American criminal organization in the city, including the Johnny Torrio-Al Capone gang, during the early years of Prohibition. \nCardinelli, also known as \"Il Diavolo\" (The Devil), was arrested by the Chicago police Homicide Squad for the 1919 murder of saloon owner Andrew P. Bowman and sentenced to hang on October 11, 1920. Following a decision by the US Supreme Court on March 4, 1921 supporting the ruling, Cardinelli was executed on Apr 15, 1921. \n",

Two days later, authorities discovered Slover's dismembered remains, wrapped in plastic bags, in and near Lake Shelbyville.\nIn 2002, Slover's ex-husband, Michael Slover Jr., his mother Jeannette Slover, and his father Michael Slover Sr. were convicted of Karyn Slover's murder and all three were sentenced to 60 years in prison.[1] The case is notable for being one of the first instances of dog DNA used as evidence in a murder trial.[2]\nAt 5:00\u00a0p.m. on September 27, 1996, Karyn Slover left her job in the advertising sales department of the Decatur Herald & Review newspaper, with the intent to pick up her son Kolten and then shop for a dress at the Hickory Point Mall in Forsyth, Illinois.[3] Later that night a black Pontiac Bonneville was discovered in central Illinois on westbound I-72 with its engine still running, its headlights on, and the driver's side door open.[4] The car was registered to David Swann, Slover's boyfriend, but contained some of Slover's personal effects including her purse and driver's license. At this time it was theorized that Slover could have been the victim of a car-jacking, as investigators did not view her as likely to have voluntarily left the area due to her recently signing with a modeling agency for a job.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Fernwood Park Race Riot was a Race Massacre instigated by white residents against African American residents who inhabited the Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) veterans' housing project in the Fernwood Park neighborhood in Chicago. Area residents viewed this as one of several attempts by the CHA to initiate racial integration into white communities.[1] The riot took place between 98th and 111th streets and lasted for three days, from the day veterans and their families moved into the project, August 13th, 1947 to August 16th, 1947. The Chicago Police Department did little to stop the rioting, as was the case a year before at the Airport Homes race riots.[2] It was one of the worst race riots in Chicago history. \nHousing projects in Chicago emerged during the 1940s with the sole purpose of resolving the shortage of affordable homes for war-industry workers, many who were African American, as America prepared for World War II.[2] As Chicago proved to be a crucial steel production center for the war effort, hundreds of thousands of black workers and their families migrated from the South to Chicago in the second wave of the Great Migration.[2] Historian Devereux Bowly iterates some alarming statistics about public housing in Chicago that arose from 1940 census data: 1) 55,157 housing units were overcrowded (exceeding 1.5 persons per room), and 2) 206,103 housing units either had no access to a private bathroom or needed major repairs to interior structures.[2] To answer to such dismal conditions, the CHA opened four housing projects in low income areas with high concentrations of war-industry workers: the Frances Cabrini Homes in August 1942, the Lawndale Gardens in December 1942, the Bridgeport Homes in May 1943, and the Robert H. Brooks Homes in March 1943.[3] For families to live in these new projects, they needed to have at least one child; the family had to have one member working in a critical war industry (like steel); the family income had to total less than $2,000; and it was preferred that the family's nationality was American.[4]\nAdditional housing projects for war workers led by the National Housing Agency and the Federal Public Housing Authority on the far South Side included the Altgeld Gardens project, which was constructed on a 157-acre vacant land tract in November 1943.[5] Unlike the above projects, Altgeld Gardens contained row houses and backyards rather than crowded multi-story apartments.[6] Similarly, the West Chesterfield project homes were commissioned by the CHA and built in December 1943.[7] A unique project, the housing units (actual homes) are built on full city lots, and following construction, the CHA required a minimum annual income as to promote eventual homeownership for residents.[8] While each of the projects identified presented reasonable options for war workers and their families, the end of the war would present different challenges, especially along the lines of integration.\n",

In 2001, he was convicted and sentenced to death, but the following year, in response to numerous miscarriages of justice in other cases, the Governor of Illinois George Ryan imposed a moratorium on capital punishment, commuting all prisoners' sentences to life imprisonment.[1][2]\nLorenzo Fayne was born on April 2, 1971, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in a family of several other brothers and sisters.[3] Fayne spent his childhood and adolescence in the northwestern part of the city, a region plagued by poverty and crime. He grew up in an unstable family, as both of his parents had scrapes with the law, suffered from alcohol and drug dependancies, and frequently subjected Lorenzo to beatings, from which he suffered psychological trauma. In 1978, at the age of only 7, he was sexually assaulted by a neighbor boy. In his teen years, he spent a lot of time on the streets, often skipping school and failing academically, eventually dropping out of school altogether. Between 1984 and 1989, he was arrested several times for robbery, burglary, assault and auto theft, spending several years in juvenile prisons, where he was also physically and sexually assaulted by fellow inmates. During his incarceration, an IQ test determined his IQ to be between 68 and 75 points, qualifying him as borderline intellectually disabled. In 1989, after he was released from prison, Lorenzo left Milwaukee and moved in with his grandmother, Nelly Willis, in East St. Louis, Illinois, where he lived for the next four years.[4][5]\nFayne first came under suspicion as a suspect in the July 23, 1993, murder of 17-year-old Faith Davis, who lived next door from his grandmother's house. Davis had been attacked in her apartment, during which she was raped and stabbed to death. In order to erase the evidence, the killer set fire to the apartment, but was spotted by witnesses, who identified him as Lorenzo Fayne. Police soon arrived to interrogate him, and while examining his clothes and home, blood stains were located. Fayne was taken to the police station, where he would eventually confess to robbing Davis' apartment, but refused to admit any involvement in her murder. On August 4, while examining fingerprints found at the crime scene, it was determined that it matched the ones found on the body of 6-year-old Aree Hunt, a young boy who had been raped and strangled on July 14, 1989, not far from Fayne's grandmother's house. After he was confronted with these findings, Lorenzo confessed to murdering both Hunt and Davis. According to his testimony, the motive for killing Aree was an inferiority complex, which drove him to commit these vicious crimes so he could feel better about himself. After his family learned about his confessions, his grandmother talked to him in late August, during which Fayne confessed to three additional killings. They were of 14-year-old Latondra Dean, raped and stabbed to death on March 20, 1992; 9-year-old Fallon Flood, raped and strangled on July 20, 1992, and 17-year-old Glenda Jones, who was raped and stabbed to death on June 25, 1993. All of the victims lived and were killed within a several hundred meter radius from the house in which Lorenzo and his grandmother lived. He was also suspected of killing another girl: 16-year-old Nicole Willis, who was raped and beaten to death a few hundred meters away from the East St. Louis High School on October 16, 1989, but Fayne denied having anything to do with her death.[6][7][8]\n",

        "paragraph": "Donald Lang (born c. 1945 \u2013 died 2008) was an American deaf mute accused serial killer from Chicago, Illinois. Lang was charged with having killed two prostitutes in Chicago, in 1965 and 1971. The cases achieved national attention because Lang could not be convicted as he was deaf, mute, unable to read or write, and did not know lip-reading or sign language.\nLang was six years old when his parents divorced; subsequently his mother could no longer afford tuition for his special training. Lang had worked at Chicago truck loading docks when he was charged with murder in 1965, shortly after the death of his mother.[1] In November 1965, Lang had picked up 37-year-old prostitute, Ernestine Williams at a local bar. Williams was found stabbed to death the next day. After a witness told Chicago police Lang had been the last person seen with Williams, they located him at his home, a public housing apartment where he stayed with a younger sister and older brother. Police found blood stained clothes in Lang's home and he was arrested.[1] When the case could not go to trial, Lang was ordered confined to a mental hospital in order to learn sign language so that he could stand trial. When this failed, his lawyer pressed for a trial; a key witness had died, the case was dismissed and Lang was freed in February 1971.[2]\nFive months after his release, another prostitute was killed in Chicago. On July 21, 1971, 29\u2013year old Earline Brown was found dead in a hotel room on the city's west side. Blood stains were found on Lang's clothes and he was arrested again on August 11, 1971. The case went to trial. As one piece of evidence, prosecutors introduced a drawing Lang had made during his interrogation, showing a woman with an \"X\" drawn over her.[2] Lang was convicted in January 1972 by a jury and sentenced to 14\u201325 years in prison.[1] In both cases Lang was represented by the deaf attorney Lowell J. Myers.[3] The verdict was overturned in 1975 by an appellate court, ruling that Lang had not been able to adequately defend himself. Lang was then confined to mental institutions and jails and periodically retested for his ability to stand trial.[4]\n",

He claimed that he was one of the international traders who could make secret multimillion-dollar deals to benefit humanitarian programs through debentures and \"prime bank notes\" in foreign banks. Hood asked for an investment of $100 and promised a payout of $5,100 within 275 days. He wanted the money delivered wrapped in aluminum foil and via Federal Express because U.S. federal government was trying to block the trades through the United States Postal Service. Therefore, the scheme should remain secret. Thousands of people from USA and overseas sent money.\nThe program stopped accepting new investors in 1995. By that time, Hood had received more than $10 million. He began to present a number of excuses as to why investors had not been paid, blaming administrative costs, problems with foreign banks and international financial conflicts. When some people still wanted to join, Hood and accomplices claimed that they could sell share units of people who had wanted to leave the program.

Though bands of roving criminals were common in many parts of Illinois, the counties of Lee, DeKalb, Ogle, and Winnebago were especially plagued by them.[1] The new crime wave in the region of the frontier Midwest may have occurred following the crackdown on Southern outlaws by the rising vigilante-regulator movement and the breakup of the criminal syndicate of John A. Murrell  and his gang, the \"Mystic Clan\" in the Southern United States. In 1841, the escalating pattern of house burglary, horse and cattle theft, stagecoach and highway robbery, counterfeiting, and murder associated with the Banditti had come to a head in Ogle County. As the crimes continued, local citizens formed bands of vigilantes known as Regulators. A clash between the Banditti and the Regulators in Ogle County near Oregon, Illinois, resulted in the outlaws' demise and decreased Banditti activity and violent crime within the county.\nBanditti and Regulator activity continued well after the lynching that took place in 1841. Crimes continued, committed by both sides, across northern and central Illinois. The Banditti were involved in other notable events, as well, including the 1845 torture-murder of merchant Colonel George Davenport, the namesake of Davenport, Iowa. Edward Bonney, an amateur detective who hunted down and brought to justice the killers, wrote of his exploits and alibi, which were recounted in his book, Banditti of the Prairies, or the Murderer's Doom!!: A Tale of the Mississippi Valley, published in Chicago in 1850.  The outlaw gangs also continued to be active in Lee and Winnebago Counties following the events in Oregon.\n",

The strike affected a total of thirty different mills belonging to the three companies, which employed 80,000 workers. The strike, which was one of the most violent labor disputes of the 1930s, ended without the strikers achieving their principal goal, recognition by the companies of the union as the bargaining agent for the workers.\nOn March 13, 1937, the United States Steel Corporation (US Steel) signed a historic collective bargaining agreement with SWOC.[1] The agreement provided for a standard pay scale, an 8-hour work day, and time and a half for overtime. Although US Steel (\"Big Steel\") signed the deal, there were smaller companies that refused to sign. That is why the strike is known as the \"Little Steel\" strike: US Steel Corporation was so massive that it gave rise to the moniker \"Little Steel\" for its four smaller competitors, Republic Steel Corporation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company, and Inland Steel Company, each ranked among the hundred largest firms in America.[1]\nThe strike did not start immediately. In fact, there was an expectation that Little Steel would follow Big Steel's lead and sign a deal with SWOC. On March 30, 1937, SWOC proposed an agreement similar to the one with US Steel to Little Steel. The proposal sought an eight-hour work day, a forty-hour work week, overtime pay, a $5-per-day minimum wage, paid vacations, health and safety standards, seniority, and procedures for resolving grievances. Rather than sign, Little Steel representatives met, debated, dragged their feet, sent spies to infiltrate SWOC, and prepared for actual battle. The companies bought poison gas and other weapons, hired private police, donated weapons to official law enforcement, encouraged law enforcement to hire more deputies, stocked their plants with food and bedding, installed search lights and barbed wire, and fired hundreds of union workers.\n",

The historian Amy Louise Wood argues that the cultural power of lynching, and of white supremacy, \"rested on spectacle...which produced and disseminated images of white power and black degradation, of white unity and black criminality, that served to instill and perpetuate a sense of racial supremacy in their white spectators.\"[3] An effervescence of lynchings occurred throughout the United States from the Civil War through the 1940s.[3] In 1919, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) published a report on incidents of lynchings in the United States.[2] The NAACP report found that 114 \"colored\" persons were lynched in 1893; down from 155 lynchings the previous year (1892), though still one of the highest years of reported lynchings on record.[2]\n",

He finished seventh in the long jump competition at the 1920 Summer Olympics.[2] He also played in the National Football League for the Hammond Pros, Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Buffalo Bisons, and Rock Island Independents. Referenced sometimes as Edward Solomon Butler, was a name used by alternate people to gain notoriety off the exploits of Solomon W. Butler in various parts of the country.[3]\nButler was born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, the youngest child of Ben and Mary Butler. His father was from Morgan County, Alabama, and born a slave in 1842; his mother was born in Georgia in 1867. His father fought in the Civil War and took the last name of Butler from General Butler whom he admired. The Butler family escaped slavery and settled in Wichita, Kansas, before moving to Hutchinson, Kansas, in 1909. \"Sol\", as he was known, made the varsity football team as a starting halfback during his freshman year. He led the school in football and in track and field. His sophomore year, he helped Hutchinson to a runner-up finish at the state meet after setting state records in the 100-yard dash. In 1913, as a junior in Hutchinson High School (Kansas) at a district meet he won six firsts, broke five meet records and unofficially broke a world record in the 50-yard dash. He along with his older brother Benjamin followed his high school coach to Rock Island High School in Rock Island, Illinois, for his senior season in 1914. Facing 300 of the best track stars of the Midwest in Chicago, he competed in the regional interscholastic meet held at Northwestern University. He placed in the 60-yard dash and hurdles, the 440 yard dash, and also in the broad jump. He broke one meet record, tied a world record, and won fourth place overall, competing against entire track teams.\nButler earned 12 varsity letters competing in football, basketball, baseball and track and field at the University of Dubuque from 1915 to 1919. According to Arthur Ashe Jr.'s book Hard Road to Glory, A History of the African-American Athlete, Butler was the first African American to quarterback a team for all four years of college. In Butler's day, the track and field of activity was restricted. There was no national collegiate meet and very little indoor competition. Even the Drake Relays, then in their formative years, provided no such event as the broad jump. Butler went to the Penn Relays for that competition and twice won the championship. In 1919, to illustrate, Butler won both the 100-yard dash and broad jump at the Penn Relays. Entering military service as a soldier in World War I as he represented the U.S. Army in the Inter-Allied Games in Paris, where he won the long jump. He was knighted by the King of Montenegro, who made Butler a Knight of the Third Order of Danilo. With the Olympic Games scheduled for renewal in 1920 after the wartime interruption in 1916, Butler was rated as a heavy favorite for the championship. His winning jump at Paris, 24\u00a0feet 9.5\u00a0inches (7.557\u00a0m),[4] was two inches from the Olympic record and was considered a strong possibility for a new Olympic record. Butler went to Antwerp for the 1920 Olympics, but misfortune nailed him quickly. On his very first jump in the Olympic preliminaries he pulled a tendon and was forced to withdraw. The injury-hampered effort was a shade under 21-8. He won the U.S. National Amateur Athletic Union championship that same year by jumping 24\u00a0feet 8\u00a0inches (7.52\u00a0m).[2][5][6]\n",

He was held at Pinckneyville Correctional Center and at one time was the longest serving inmate incarcerated by the State of Illinois as well as the third longest in state history before his release on February 21, 2020.[2] On November 21, 2019, the Illinois Prisoner Review Board granted parole to Weger by a vote of 9\u20134.[3] He was released on parole February 21, 2020.[4][5][6]\nIn March 1960, three women, Frances Murphy (47), Mildred Lindquist (50), and Lillian Oetting (50), wives of prominent Chicago businessmen, took a four-day trip to Starved Rock State Park in LaSalle County, Illinois, along the banks of the Illinois River. They arrived from the Chicago suburb of Riverside, about 90 miles northeast of the park.[2][7] On March 14, after checking into the Starved Rock Lodge, the three took an afternoon hike through St. Louis Canyon, but never returned. Their disappearances went unnoticed until March 16 when the husband of Frances Murphy phoned the lodge to inquire about his wife. Police organized a search of the park which led to the discovery of the women's bodies, bound with twine and partially disrobed, inside a cave in the canyon. All three suffered severe head trauma and a blood stained tree limb found nearby was determined to have been used to bludgeon them to death.[2][7][8]\nWeger, a dishwasher at the Starved Rock Lodge, was among those interviewed by Illinois State Police in the aftermath of the discovery. Several employees of the lodge told investigators that he showed to work the day after the women's disappearances with scratches on his face. Weger was questioned extensively in the weeks following the murders and was administered at least three lie detector tests, which he passed. However, investigators continued to pursue him owing to his past brushes with the law. He fit the description of an assailant who bound a teenage girl with twine and raped her at nearby Matthiessen State Park months earlier, and was later identified by the victim in a photo line-up. The twine used to bind the murder victims was the same as that found in the kitchen at the lodge, and he failed a lie detector test given to him in September. Based on this, investigators put him on nonstop surveillance.[2][9][10]\n",

Morse's murder was notable for the young ages of the victim and the killers, and brought further national attention to the plight of children in Chicago's housing projects.[1] Rankins and Johnson, both minors at the time, were convicted for the murder of Morse and sentenced to five years' imprisonment each.\nOn October 13, 1994, two of five-year-old Eric Morse's schoolmates, Jesse Rankins (aged ten years old) and Tykeece Johnson (aged 11), had asked him to steal candy from a store, but Morse refused.

Wells Homes, a housing project in Chicago's South Side. Rankins and Johnson dangled Morse out of a window of the apartment, resisting attempts by Lemon to intervene, and then dropped him. Morse suffered massive head injuries and was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.[2]\nThe Illinois legislature enacted a law permitting 10-year-old children to be sentenced to prison.

The media ran exaggerated accounts of his bravado and colorful personality, and cast him as a Robin Hood.[1][2][3] In response, J.

He then moved to Missouri, where he subsequently murdered his wife and two men in 1889 and 1890, respectively.

Williamson.[2] According to Thomas, his father was a harsh man who demanded hard work from his son from an early age. At the age of 10, he began to steal, committing numerous thefts around Tazewell County, and spending a majority of his evenings in Oakdale, where he was known as a miscreant.[2] At age 13, he attempted to rob a store in Pekin, but was caught and sent to the local penitentiary, but released after being found not guilty at a trial several weeks later.[2] At age 22, he was struck down with an illness, which caused him to be paralysed on one side.[3]\nAfter spending a majority of the following years bouncing between working for his father and uncle, Thomas was jailed for horse stealing in Centralia, where he spent a week. Upon his release, he decided to join the Union Army, thinking that the military life might do him good.

There were two trials, the first ruled a mistrial because of Wynekoop's fragile health. The second resulted in conviction and a 25-year sentence.

He joined Dean O'Banion's North Side Gang, which had taken over the formerly legal breweries and distilleries in that part of the city giving them massive profits from illicit production of alcohol, in addition to shakedowns and other rackets. Often described as mainly Irish-American, after O'Banion's death the North Side Gang was successively headed by Hymie Weiss, Drucci and Bugs Moran who were respectively of Polish, Italian and French descent, while the most influential members who never became leader were Louis Alterie, of Spanish parentage, Samuel Morton who was from a Jewish background, and the German Albert Kachellek.\n",

Over the next several years, fire bombings, racially charged boycotts and shootouts were common place in Cairo, with 170 nights of gunfire reported in 1969 alone.[1][2]\nThe unrest was a factor in the depopulation of Cairo.\nCairo's turbulent history of race relations is often traced back to the lynching of black resident William James. In 1900, Cairo had a population of nearly 13,000. Of that total, approximately 5,000 residents were African-American. In 1900, this was an unusually high black population for a town of Cairo's size, and five percent of all black residents of the state of Illinois resided here. As a result of the large black population in a town with a traditionally southern white heritage, race relations were already strained by 1900. On the night of November 11, 1909, two men were lynched. The first man lynched was a black man named William James, who was allegedly responsible for the murder of Anna Pelly, a young white woman killed three days earlier. The second man lynched was a white man named Henry Salzner, who had allegedly murdered his wife in the previous August.[3]\n",

The school is named in honor of the African\u2013American poet, novelist, and playwright Paul Laurence Dunbar.[7]\nOpening in September 1942[8] as a Dunbar Trade School, the school was created to provide skill workers for the war. When the school opened, the school had a student enrollment of 1,500; Mostly all of which were African\u2013American. The school was considered as a \"vocational branch\" of Wendell Phillips High School, considering both schools were predominately African\u2013American. In 1946, the Chicago Public Schools changed the trade school into a public high school, accepting ninth grade students in January of that year. The school's first location was in a former elementary school building located at 4401 South St.  Lawrence Avenue. In addition to the school building, twenty\u2013two mobile classroom which served as vocational shops were constructed on the site over the course of several months after its opening.[9]\nBy 1952, Dunbar suffered from issues dealing with overcrowding and aging of the school building. The Chicago Board of Education decided that a new school building was needed for Dunbar. A vacant site about two and a half miles north from the school's location was voted on and selected as the new Dunbar's location in mid\u20131954; costing the district a mere $7 million to construct.[10] The groundbreaking ceremony for the new school occurred in April 1955 with Chicago school officials and then newly elected Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley, construction began at 3000 South Parkway Avenue (now Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) shortly thereafter. The new Dunbar Vocational High School building opened for students for the 1956\u201357 school year.[11] By the school's 20th anniversary in 1962, the enrollment was at 2,300; which included students taking night classes and drop-outs enrolled in trade classes.[12]\n",

The building stands on a public square in the city's downtown commercial district. The current structure was completed in 1891 and was preceded by two other buildings, one of which was destroyed by a group of outlaws. Following the destruction of the courthouse, the county was without a judicial building for a period during the 1840s. The Ogle County Courthouse was designed by Chicago architect George O. Garnsey in the Romanesque Revival style of architecture. The ridged roof is dominated by its wooden cupola which stands out at a distance.\nIn addition to the courthouse building, the public square contains several outbuildings and sites that are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Oregon Commercial Historic District, including a sculpture by Lorado Taft and a cast-iron fountain. The courthouse joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration. The courthouse no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county; its successor is located directly across the street.\nOgle County Courthouse has been the name of three buildings.  The current structure on the public square, no longer in use as the judiciary center in Ogle County, was constructed in late 1890 and early 1891 at a cost of US$107,000.[3] The basically square Romanesque Revival structure is topped with a cupola and features a full basement. It was designed by Chicago architect George O. Garnsey.[4]\n",

Two of those cases were dismissed, with Coleman pleading guilty to lesser charges in two and twice being acquitted. Coleman was scheduled to go on trial in Illinois on charges stemming from the rape of a 14-year-old girl when he fled and began his killing spree.[1]\n",

He was the elder son of entrepreneur Michael Albanese, Sr. and his wife Clara (n\u00e9e Kolasinski). Little is known of his childhood, but acquaintances would recall that Albanese was a \"spoiled brat who always wanted to be a big shot\", an ambitious young man who wanted to earn as much money doing as little work as possible.[2] During the mid-1960s, he worked as a car salesman for Norwood Motors Inc., based out of Morton Grove.[3]\nHis first known crime occurred on February 1, 1965, when Albanese and an unidentified accomplice, posing as detectives, broke into the home of 61-year-old CTA bus driver Emmett Farrell and stole $160 from him.[3] About a week later, using information provided by a neighbor who had written down his car's license plate, Albanese was arrested and positively identified by the Farrells as one of the burglars.[3] Not long after, he was indicted by a grand jury for armed robbery and several counts of auto theft (the latter under the alias \"Charles Romaine\"), for which he was convicted and sentenced to five years probation.[4] Following his conviction, his first wife divorced him after six years of marriage and moved away with their three daughters to live in Wisconsin.[2][5]\n",

He was taught to play the guitar by his neighbor, the blues musician Blind Percy (who would later accompany him in concerts in the area). In 1942, Robinson began playing in the Maxwell Street market, where he also performed with local musicians.[2] In 1948, Robinson met Eddie Taylor, and the two worked the Chicago club scene together until 1952.[3] After the two split, Robinson formed a band, the Every Hour Blues Boys, with Freddie King, whom he met outside a welfare center.[2] The band lasted four years, and King later credited Robinson as one of his earliest and most influential teachers. In 1955, Robinson joined a band led by Little Walter, which became popular in Chicago. In 1958, Walter was incapacitated by a shooting, and Robinson became the vocalist of the group in Walter's absence, but he left the band later that year, because of personnel issues.[4] Throughout the 1950s, Robinson was in demand as a session musician, playing bass guitar and rhythm guitar for such artists as Howlin' Wolf, and Magic Sam.[2] In addition to his session work, he recorded three singles for the Bandera label, including one of his signature songs, \"All of My Life\", in 1960.[5]\n",

He started his professional baseball career with the Waterloo Microbes in 1904.[1] After a short stint with the Tigers, Raymond returned to the minors. He developed his spitball sometime in 1906. With the new pitch, he had a big season in 1907, going 35-11 for the South Atlantic League's Charleston Sea Gulls. Raymond pitched a no-hitter that year, as well, and led Charleston to the pennant.[2] The Cardinals purchased him in September, and in 1908, he was the best pitcher on the team. His 2.03 earned run average ranked tenth in the National League, and his 145 strikeouts were fourth-best. During the 1908 season, he gave up fewer hits per game than Christy Mathewson and threw five shutouts, but he was also on the mound eleven times when the Cardinals failed to score.[3]\nRaymond was known for his spitball and got his nickname because of his zany antics on the mound. What might have been a promising career was short-circuited by a severe addiction to alcohol. The only manager who could keep Raymond in line for any length of time was hard-nosed Giants manager John McGraw. McGraw picked him up in the Roger Bresnahan trade before the 1909 season, and Bugs won 18 games for him that year.[2]\n",

Roe earned the nickname \"Robin Hood\" because of his philanthropy among the neighborhood poor.[1][2] After refusing to pay \"street tax\" or hand over his illegal gambling empire to the Chicago Outfit, Roe fatally shot a made man who had been ordered to assassinate him.\nRoe was born in Galliano, Louisiana to an African American sharecropper, and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas.[3]  As a child, he received no formal education, and when he was of age, he did odd jobs for a tailor and learned how to sew. Some time after that, he got involved in bootlegging and gained a notorious reputation as a colorful racketeer who could pass for white. His career as a bootlegger ended after a few years and he moved to Detroit, where he worked in an automobile plant. When he was 31 years old, he took what he learned working for the tailor in Arkansas, and moved from Detroit to Chicago and began working for an African American tailor named Edward P. Jones. Shortly after Roe began working for Jones, Jones decided to get involved in policy and he made Roe his first \"runner\", or salesman of lottery chances. Under the protection of politicians Edward Joseph Kelly and Patrick Nash, the Kelly-Nash Machine, Jones was making $2000 a day by 1930. By 1938 he had increased his earnings to $10,000 per day and Roe was pulling down nice cuts from the profits. They soon caught the attention of The Chicago Outfit after Jones met Sam Giancana in prison, and they set out to take over the numbers racket in Chicago. The Jones-Roe wheels were netting over $25 million annually, by 1946 and the mob, seeking to move in on the Jones brothers and Roe, kidnapped Ed Jones and held him for a ransom that included $100,000 and a promise to relinquish his policy business. Roe paid the $100,000 ransom but after Jones was released, he decided not to give up his share of the business. However, the Jones brothers fled to Mexico, leaving the entire business to Roe.\nChicago Outfit capo, Sam Giancana, who was attempting to take over the Southside gambling operations, ordered an attempt to kidnap Roe. On June 19, 1951, Roe ended up killing one of the kidnappers, Fat Lenny Caifano, who was not only a made man, but also the brother of capo Marshall Joseph Caifano.\n",

Hinde.[1]  Before the hotel was built, the property where the hotel was located was a site of a former homestead, and was used by Frederick Hinde Zimmerman for multiple small shops that sold goods to fisherman and tourists.\nFrederick Hinde Zimmerman was the founder and owner of the hotel, and he completed construction and opened the hotel to the public on August 7, 1922. The hotel had 36 rooms and one large assembly room that served as a dining room, meeting hall, and was used for weddings, exhibitions, anniversaries, and other important occasions. The hotel was one of the first major resorts on the southern portion of the Wabash River and quickly was able to attract tourist from across the country because of its location on the river and ease of access provided by the railroad. During its nine-year existence the hotel established a reputation for luxury and high quality.\nIn later years, after manager Glenn Goodart took over operation of the hotel, it gradually began to lose patronage due to incompetent business planning and flooding of the Wabash River in the summers of 1927, 1928, and 1929. On July 29, 1929, Glenn Goodart burned the Grand Rapids Hotel to the ground by dropping a blowtorch in the basement shop.  Three months before Goodart burned the hotel down, the United States Senate Committee on Commerce had decided to remove the Grand Rapids Dam by revoking funding. Due to the onset of the Great Depression shortly after the hotel was burned down, it was not rebuilt. The same year Goodart burned the hotel down he was elected as Finance Commissioner for Wabash County, Illinois.\n",

A veteran of Chicago's \"circulation wars\" during the 1910s, Ragen would work under Moses Annenberg with other future Chicago mobsters such as Maurice Enright, Walter Stevens and Peter Gentleman in \"bootjacking\" or forcing downtown newspaper stands to sell Chicago American.\nBy the early 1930s, Ragen had begun overseeing the day to day office operations for the Nationwide News Service (then known as the General News Service), the sole distributors of racetrack and other gambling results nationwide, under the control of Moses Annenberg. An invaluable source of revenue for legal and illegal gambling alike, the organization was highly sought after among organized crime leaders throughout the decade. Faced with pressure from the Chicago Outfit and the Roosevelt administration, who sought to charge Annenberg with anti-trust and income tax evasion charges Annenberg was eventually forced by Democratic political opponents to sell the National News Service to Ragen on November 15, 1939.\n",

He played on hundreds of recordings by many pre\u2013World War II blues artists. Under his own name, he was one of the most recorded blues musicians of the 1930s and 1940s and is closely associated with Chicago producer Lester Melrose[2] and Bluebird Records. His popular songs, original or adapted, include \"Good Morning, School Girl\", \"Sugar Mama\", \"Early in the Morning\", and \"Stop Breaking Down\".\nWilliamson's harmonica style was a great influence on postwar performers. Later in his career, he was a mentor to many up-and-coming blues musicians who moved to Chicago, including Muddy Waters. In an attempt to capitalize on Williamson's fame, Aleck \"Rice\" Miller began recording and performing as Sonny Boy Williamson in the early 1940s, and later, to distinguish the two, John Lee Williamson came to be known as Sonny Boy Williamson I or \"the original Sonny Boy\".\nWilliamson was born in Madison County, Tennessee, near Jackson, in 1914.[3] His original recordings are in the country blues style, but he soon demonstrated skill at making the harmonica a lead instrument for the blues and popularized it for the first time in a more urban blues setting. He has been called \"the father of modern blues harp\". While in his teens he joined Yank Rachell and Sleepy John Estes,[1] playing with them in Tennessee and Arkansas. In 1934 he settled in Chicago.[3]\n",

Becoming involved in an underworld dispute over illegal gambling operations, he was killed with his associate Louis Dorman on May 5, 1943.\n",

He gained power through petty crime and by heading a chain of brothels. From about 1902 until his death in 1920, he led a gang that became known after his death as the Chicago Outfit. Colosimo was assassinated on May 11, 1920, and no one was ever charged with his murder.[3] Johnny Torrio, an enforcer whom Colosimo imported in 1909 from New York, seized control of Colosimo's businesses after his death. Al Capone, a close associate of Torrio, has been accused of involvement in Colosimo's murder, but was not yet in Chicago at the time.[3]\nColosimo was born on February 16, 1878, to Luigi Colosimo and his second wife Giuseppina Mascaro in the town of Colosimi, Province of Cosenza, Italy.[4] He emigrated from Italy to Chicago at the age of 17, starting out as a petty criminal. Colosimo attracted the attention of First Ward aldermen Michael \"Hinky Dink\" Kenna and John Coughlin. They made him a precinct captain and later their bagman. This gave Colosimo the political connections that helped him in his rise to power as a mob boss.[5]\n",

In March 1911, the so-called Shotgun Man reportedly murdered four people within 72 hours.[3] The neighborhood was well-known for Italian immigrant and Italian-American violence, and the Shotgun Man is assumed to have been involved in the \"underworld\".\nAlthough the killings were witnessed by dozens of bystanders, the Chicago police were never able to identify the murderer. However, he was said to be well known throughout the Italian community and, with the political influence of the Black Hand, residents may have been hesitant to turn in the assassin.[4] Although the fate of Shotgun Man is unknown, he seems to have disappeared from Little Italy shortly before Prohibition, as extortion operations of the Black Hand had faded away by the end of the decade.\nThis crime-related article is a stub.

He was convicted in 2002 of the 1995 murder of his wife Donnah Winger, an operating room technician, and Roger Harrington (born 1967). Winger had married Donnah Winger (n\u00e9e Brown, born 1963) in 1989.[1]\nOn August 23, 1995, Donnah Winger was driven from St. Louis International Airport to her home in Springfield by shuttle driver Roger Harrington. The Wingers later complained to Harrington's employer, saying that Harrington gave Donnah a \"hard time\" during the ride by talking about getting high and having orgies. Six days later, Mark Winger called 911, saying that he had shot Harrington to death after Harrington attacked Donnah with a hammer in their home. The police initially believed that Harrington had broken into the Wingers' home and attacked Donnah in retaliation for their complaint to Harrington's employer.  However, investigators later became suspicious of Winger because he continued to ask about the case even after it had been initially closed.[2] \"He kept coming in. I kept feeling like he was trying to find out if we were checking into anything,\" said a detective. Winger's remarriage to his young daughter's new nanny, hired five months after Donnah died, increased suspicion. Winger eventually had three children with his new wife.\nFour years after Donnah's death, her best friend, DeAnn Shultz, came forward and told police that she and Winger had been involved in an affair at the time of Donnah's death. Winger had ended the affair soon after Donnah's death, and Shultz suspected that he had killed Donnah. On reexamination of the evidence, police concluded that the positions of Donnah's and Harrington's bodies were inconsistent with Winger's account of a struggle with Harrington. They also found evidence in Harrington's car that Mark Winger had invited Harrington to the Winger home. The new theory was that Donnah's upsetting ride with Harrington inspired Winger to plan to kill her with the hammer and then to shoot Harrington, using the fabricated story of an attack by Harrington as a cover. He was charged with murder in 2001.\n",

He became a high-ranking lieutenant for the Chicago Outfit, specializing in extortion and blackmail, under Frank Nitti after Al Capone's 1931 tax evasion conviction.  In 1936, Gioe went to Des Moines, Iowa to expand syndicate operations.  He eventually returned to Chicago, leaving underboss Louis \"Cock-Eyed Louie\" Fratto in control of the Des Moines operations. During the mid-1930s, Gioe, Paul \"The Waiter\" Ricca and Louis \"Little New York\" Campagna, began financially supporting extortion operations by Willie Morris Bioff and George Brown against Hollywood movie studios.  In exchange for annual payoffs to the Outfit, the mob-controlled  projectionist unions would refrain from labor strikes and disruptions.\nIn the late 1930s, the extortion racket was busted by law enforcement. On March 18, 1943 Gioe, Ricca, and Campagna were indicted for extortion; Bioff and Browne agreed to testify against them. On December 31, 1943, Gioe was convicted of extortion and sentenced to ten years in prison.[1] Gioe was later paroled (along with the other syndicate members) in 1947, despite protests from Senator Estes Kefauver. Upon his release, Gioe became second to Ricca and Campagna as the top Chicago syndicate leader.[citation needed]\n",

Rhoades is additionally suspected of torturing, raping, and killing more than 50 women between 1975 and 1990, based on data about his truck routes and women who went missing during those years and who met the profile of his preferred victims. At the time he was caught, Rhoades claimed to have engaged in these activities for 15 years.[1][2]\nRobert Benjamin Rhoades was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa in 1945, but it is uncertain as to exactly where he was raised. He was raised by his mother in the early years of his life, as his father was a soldier in the United States Army and was stationed in West Germany. Rhoades was attending elementary school when his father returned from duty overseas. After his father was discharged from the military, he found work as a firefighter.\nBy all reliable accounts, Rhoades' early life was relatively normal, aside from unspecified social problems in his formative years. He was an active participant in the extracurricular activities of his attended schools, and involved himself with various sports and other programs, including gridiron football, wrestling, choir and French club. Rhoades' criminal involvement during his high school years were only notable for an arrest in 1961, at age 16, for tampering with a vehicle, along with an arrest for public fighting in 1962 at age 17.\n",

The prison also has a medium security unit that houses medium to minimum security inmates and is classified as Level 3. Until the 2011 abolition of the death penalty in Illinois,[1] the prison housed male death row inmates, but had no execution chamber. Inmates were executed at the Tamms Correctional Center. Although the capacity of the prison is 2172, it has an average daily population of approximately 2000 inmates.\nIn May 2008, Governor Rod Blagojevich proposed to shut down the Pontiac facility, with a phase-out plan to take place from January through February 2009. The inmate population would be transferred to the Thomson facility, a newly built maximum security prison, which is also equipped to house segregated inmates. Illinois has since sold Thomson to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Pontiac facility is one of the largest employers in the Livingston County community.  Blagojevich's successor, Pat Quinn, cancelled plans to close Pontiac Correctional Center in March 2009 after taking office.[2][3]\nThe prison was operated as a boys' reform school from 1872 to 1893. It was formally established as the State Reformatory for youths after that. Among its early detainees was Charles Hair, a Cherokee convicted at age 12 of intent to assault an officer, as he was picked up in an armed raid by law offices in November 1892 raid at the fort of Ned Christie, also Cherokee. Christie had been declared an outlaw after being wrongly accused of killing a federal marshal in 1887, and was killed in the raid. Hair was held in Illinois for three years.[4]\n",

These riots are remembered as a turning point in Puerto Rican civic involvement in Chicago.[1][2] This was the first riot in the United States attributed to Puerto Ricans.[3]\nPuerto Rican migration to Chicago peaked in the 1950s and 60s, and the Puerto Rican population of Chicago jumped from 255 in 1950 to 32,371 in 1960.[4] Puerto Ricans in Chicago worked low-paying jobs in the service industries or labored in factories. This was in part because of the recruitment efforts of Castle, Barton and Associates, an employment agency. They offered domestic and foundry work contracts, and paid the airfare for Puerto Ricans coming to Chicago.[5] Another factor behind Puerto Rican migration to Chicago was the unemployment and harsh economic conditions created by Operation Bootstrap.[5]\nSome of the new Puerto Rican arrivals settled in Chicago's north side, specifically in Lincoln Park. But by the late 1960s, gentrification took hold in Lincoln Park, and working class Puerto Ricans were displaced by high property taxes and expensive housing.[5] Around the city, some Puerto Ricans faced housing discrimination based on their skin color and ethnicity. Many moved west, settling near Division Street in West Town, Bucktown, and Wicker Park.[6] The Chicago Catholic Church did not offer the Puerto Rican community their own parish, so devout Puerto Ricans had to try to attend existing parishes. In the 1950s and 60s, some white parishes did not accept Puerto Rican parishioners, so Puerto Ricans were displaced, looking for a place to worship and meet.[7] According to Felix M. Padilla, the systematic oppression that Puerto Ricans experienced in Chicago in the 1960s created a psychological climate for riot. Puerto Ricans faced racial discrimination, class-related hardships, and lived on the margins of a city that only valued them for their cheap labor.[8]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Englewood race riot, or Peoria Street riot, was one of many post-World War II race riots in Chicago, Illinois that took place in November 1949.\nWhites in the neighborhood rioted, attacking other whites, partially based on rumors and misinformation that blacks were meeting to take over their neighborhood.\nAccording to labor historian Rick Halpern the U.P.W.A (United Packing Workers of America) were holding an interracial union meeting at the home of Aaron Bindman (a member of the CIO's longshoremen's union), Louise Bindman and Bill and Gussie Sennett.  The neighbors were disturbed by the presence of the attending black shop stewards and insisted they leave the area, and when Bindman refused this request two days of rioting began.  Although one hundred policeman were on the scene, the crowd almost destroyed Bindman's home.  This is a very interesting and perhaps overlooked flash point in the history of the civil rights movement because it marks a place where the struggles of labor moved beyond the plants and into the larger community where it joined forces with other activist organizations.  Indeed the UPWA quickly emerged at the forefront of community wide mobilization.  They publicized and formed a committee that brought considerable pressure to bear upon Mayor Kennelly, who flatly refused to make any statement about the disturbance, demanding that he ensured adequate police protection.  A well-publicized move to research mayoral impeachment prompted Kennelly to issue a statement and meet with the commissioner of police.  The committee also help expose the exploitative practices of banks and real estate companies that were promoting and profiting from \"white flight.\"[1]\n",

Aspiring African-American professionals seeking to obtain improved housing beyond the increasingly overcrowded South Side ghetto, whether in private residences or in the new public housing developments constructed by the Chicago Housing Authority, were frequently greeted by attempted arsons, bombings, and angry white mobs often numbering into the thousands.[1]\nIn early June 1951, Mrs. DeRose, who owned an apartment building at 6139\u201343 W. 19th Street in Cicero, got into a controversy with her tenants and was ordered to refund a portion of the rent. Afterwards, out of anger and/or profit, she rented an apartment to Harvey E. Clark Jr., an African-American World War II veteran and graduate of Fisk University, and his family in an all-white neighborhood. A high-ranking Cicero official learned that an African-American family was moving into a Cicero apartment and warned Mrs. DeRose that there would be \"trouble\" if he moved in. At 2:30 pm, on June 8, a moving van containing $2,000 worth of Clark's furniture was stopped by the police. The rental agent was ushered out with a drawn revolver at his back. A jeering crowd gathered and Clark was told by the police to get out or he would be arrested \"for protective custody.\" A detective warned Clark that, \"I'll bust your damned head if you don't move.\" At 6:00 pm, Clark was grabbed by 20 police officers. The chief of police told him, \"Get out of here fast. There will be no moving into this building.\" Clark was hit eight times as he was pushed towards a car which was parked across the street and was shoved inside the car. The police told him, \"Get out of Cicero and don't come back in town or you'll get a bullet through you.\". A suit was filed by the NAACP against the Cicero Police Department on June 26, and the Clark family moved in.[2]\n",

Johnson, despite being born with a deformity in his right hand, strangled each of the women to death. After failing to kill a fifth victim, who later pinpointed him to police, Johnson was arrested and sentenced to 100 years imprisonment on one count of murder in 2015.[1]\nJohnson was born in South Side, Chicago in 1986. He was born missing three fingers from his right hand, which is possibly because of his mother's heavy use of drugs while she was pregnant.[1] When he was 5 years old, his father left the family, leaving Johnson and his six other siblings in the hand of his mother who often neglected them. His mother also regularly beat Johnson with electrical cords and barred him along with his siblings from leaving the house.[2] Due to this, she would not let any of them attend high school. The family struggled financially so as a way of work his mother resorted to prostitution, while Johnson would often travel to the corner store to beg for food.[2]\nJohnson met Tena Anderson at a friend's birthday in 2006. The two dived into a relationship and a year later Anderson delivered Johnson's baby. In April 2008 Johnson was granted work at FedEx, but due to him struggling financially he became homeless and was subsequently laid off from work.[2]\n",

B. Hutto, Sunnyland Slim, Lacy Gibson, and Little Walter. AllMusic noted that \"the playing style of Jackson is vastly influential\".[1]\nJackson was fatally shot during a family argument in 1979.\nHe was born in Gill, Lee County, Arkansas, United States.[3][4] In his youth, Jackson was influenced by his uncle Alf Bonner and aunt Cora, who led their own jug band.  The couple also ran a roadside cafe situated between Helena, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee, which regularly played host to blues musicians from neighbouring States. Jackson joined the Bonner's Jug Band and performed with them for a number of years.  He thereafter branched out on his own as a traveling musician, playing in Memphis, then across Florida, in St. Louis, Missouri, before finally, in around 1950, coming to a halt in Chicago, Illinois. The French music historian, G\u00e9rard Herzhaft, later commented that \"The guitar style of Lee Jackson, sharp, jazzy, with sparse but brilliant and bluesy notes was quite original for the immediate post-war Chicago blues scene, reflecting his years playing with swinging jug bands\".[5]\n",

In 1987, he was kidnapped and held for ransom by Danny Edwards and Nancy Rish. The conditions of his confinement caused him to die of asphyxiation. As a result, Edwards was given the death penalty (later commuted) and Rish was sentenced to life in prison without parole.\nSmall was born in 1947 and raised in Kankakee, Illinois. His parents, Burrell and Reva Small, owned and operated a media conglomerate called Mid America Media; the Small family also owned the controlling interest in United Press International; and this is where Small himself worked. His great grandfather was Illinois governor Len Small. Stephen Small had received his education at Lake Forest Academy, the University of Denver and Mark Hopkins College.[2]  In 1969, he married Nancy Pedersen, with whom he had three sons.\nAround 12:30\u00a0a.m. on September 2, 1987, someone claiming to be a Kankakee police officer called the Small home and told Stephen Small that a burglary had occurred at the B. Harley Bradley House, a property that Small owned and was in the process of renovating. Small got dressed and left his home. Around 3:30 that morning someone called the Small residence and told Stephen's wife, Nancy, \"We have your husband.\" Nancy then heard her husband say that he had been handcuffed inside a box underground. Small told his wife to obtain\u2007$1 million in cash. The caller directed Mrs. Small not to report the matter to the police.\nThe matter was reported to the authorities, however, and devices were connected to the Smalls' telephone line to record incoming calls and to determine their origins. At 5:03 that afternoon, the same person called again, asking Mrs. Small how much money had been collected. This call was placed from a telephone located at a Phillips 66 gas station in Aroma Park. Edwards was seen there at that time, in the company of a blonde-haired woman.\nAt 5:40\u00a0p.m., Jean Alice Small, Stephen Small's aunt, telephoned the Small residence to tell them of a call she had just received. Jean said that the caller had told her that he knew that Nancy Small's telephone was tapped. After telling Jean that the victim was buried, the caller threatened to kill Jean's husband. Nancy Small received another telephone call from the kidnapper at 11:28 that night. This call originated from a telephone at a Sunoco station in Aroma Park, where an FBI agent saw a white male at a telephone, and a blonde-haired woman in a car that was later identified as belonging to Nancy Rish, Edwards' girlfriend; Rish had blonde hair. The caller played a tape recording of Stephen Small's voice. On the tape, Stephen provided instructions for delivering the ransom. After audio enhancement, a voice in the background could be heard threatening Small.\n",

        "paragraph": "The Charleston riot occurred on March 28, 1864, in Charleston, Illinois, after Union soldiers and local Republicans clashed with local insurgent Democrats known as Copperheads. By the time the riot had subsided, nine were dead and twelve had been wounded.  It is generally thought that one of the events that triggered the riot was the treatment of Judge Charles H. Constable by Union soldiers.  The soldiers humiliated Constable by making him swear allegiance to the federal government, due to his decision to allow four Union deserters to go free in Marshall, Illinois. When the riot began, Judge Constable was holding court in Charleston.[1]\nThe news coverage of the event stated that the Peace Democrats were responsible for beginning the event. One such news source, from the Chicago Tribune, later reprinted in the Charleston Courier, labeled Nelson Wells as the instigator of the conflict. Most articles published from the time, insist that the whole event transpired as a more spontaneous event and was not directly prompted by any one individual. The most likely explanation is that the event occurred because a sizable presence of both Copperheads and Union soldiers had been in town that day. Also many sources speculate that a sizable portion of the participants, at least on the side of the Peace Democrats, had been drinking quite heavily all day, and this led to the outbreak that resulted in the confrontation. At any rate, the fighting only lasted a few moments. But by the time the affair was over, the Copperheads had been run out of Charleston. Rewards had been issued for the capture of any of those whom fled the scene. Included in those who left town, was John O\u2019Hair, the leader of the Copperheads, who had been the sheriff of Coles County. Out of those killed, only two had been Copperheads, Nelson Wells and John Cooper; the other participants had been either captured or escaped. Other Union troops were called in from Mattoon to assist the soldiers fighting in Charleston, but by the time their train arrived, none of the instigators were left in the town. Fifteen prisoners were eventually held for seven months, initially in Springfield, Illinois. President Lincoln, whose father and stepmother had lived in Coles County, waived the prisoners' right to Habeas Corpus and ordered their removal to Fort Delaware in the East. He ordered their release on November 4, 1864. Two of the prisoners had been indicted for murder and were exonerated by trial in December, 1864. Twelve other Copperheads had also been indicted for murder. They were never captured, and the indictments were annulled in May 1873.\nThe terms Copperheads and Butternuts were used to describe the larger movement, which has been known as Peace Democrats. This political affiliation which stirred up support, as David Montgomery points out in Beyond Equality: Labor and the Radical Republicans, by incorporating the fears that the federal government's war effort sought to usurp the constitution. The copperheads incorporated a racial component to their disdain for the Republican war effort, as Montgomery points out, that emancipated Negroes would flood the North, because of the Emancipation Proclamation. Using racially charged rhetoric, Copperheads sought to unite opposition to the Radical Republicans. This had become a national phenomenon during the American Civil War. Democrat sympathizers were battling to keep their country from becoming, in their eyes, too radical.\n",

Search parties were organized, but for four days Jaclyn was nowhere to be found.\nOn September 14, 1988, Jaclyn Dowaliby's body was found abandoned at a dump site, located  6\u00a0mi (9.7\u00a0km) away from her home. Although an autopsy could not reveal when she had been killed, the police suspected that Cynthia and David were involved in the crime. In 1990 they were put on trial for her murder. Cynthia was acquitted but David was convicted on eyewitness testimony which placed him at the scene where her body was found.[3] In October 1991, an appellate court overturned his conviction,[4][5] ruling that there was no more evidence against him than there had been against Cynthia. On November 13, 1991, David Dowaliby was released from prison. Nobody else has been arrested or convicted for her murder.[6]\n",

Areas with histories of violent crime and drug use such as Washington Park and Garfield Park have been common locations for these murders to occur.[5] This pattern was recognized in 2018 through the Murder Accountability Project (MAP), which reviewed over 50 unsolved strangulation and asphyxiation cases dating as far back as 2001.[6] The algorithm used by MAP sorts unsolved homicides by location, victim, and killing method in order to identify clusters associated with low homicide clearance rates. According to MAP, these factors could be indictive of an active serial killer.[3]\n",

Following an extensive investigation into his death, the murder trial was, at the time, the longest-running trial in U.S. history.[2] Cronin's murder caused a public backlash against secret societies, including protests and written condemnations by the leadership of the Catholic Church.\nCronin grew up in the U.S. and Canada, and moved to the Midwestern United States after the American Civil War. He became a physician and a prominent member of high society, and represented St. Louis at the Exposition Universelle (1878). While in St. Louis, Cronin joined multiple clubs, among them, the Irish nationalist organization, Clan na Gael. When he moved to Chicago, Cronin continued his involvement with Clan na Gael. After criticizing the leadership of the Chicago camp of Clan na Gael, he was expelled from the group and accused of being a British spy. In May 1889, Cronin disappeared. Later that month, public works employees discovered his body in a sewer in a northern suburb of Chicago. The press coverage of the investigation and trial caught international attention.[3] Cronin's funeral drew the largest crowds for a funeral since the arrival of Abraham Lincoln's body in Chicago.

Robey Street[2] in Chicago, Illinois, to James A. Touhy[3] and his wife, Mary (n\u00e9e  Mordan).[4] James was an immigrant from County Sligo, Ireland.[3] Roger was one of eight children, the youngest of six boys, with an older sister and a younger sister. Rarely for the Chicago Police Department at that time, Patrolman James Touhy was known to be fiercely honest and incorruptible,[4] but he was also a strict disciplinarian who beat his children so severely that his neighbors complained. Mary Touhy was a devout Catholic who required her children to attend Mass with her.[5]\n",

Many armed themselves; some suffered adverse psychological effects.

It showed that McDonald was walking away from the police when he was shot 16 times by Officer Van Dyke. That same day, Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder, and was initially held without bail at the Cook County Jail.[6] He was released on bail on November 30.[7] The city reached a settlement with McDonald's family for $5 million in April 2015.

The multi-day riot has been described as the \"worst case of labor-related violence in 20th-century American history\",[2] and among the worst racial riots in U.S. history.\nIn the aftermath, the East St. Louis Chamber of Commerce called for the resignation of the local police chief because officers were told not to shoot white rioters and were unable to suppress the violence and destruction. A number of black people left the city permanently; black enrollment in public schools in the area had dropped by 35% by the time schools opened in the fall.[3]\n",

Originally from Palermo, Sicily, Di Giorgio lived most of his life as a grocer in New Orleans, where he was also an active Black Hander. While he lived in Los Angeles, he was known as a wealthy food importer. He survived two shootings, only to be killed while visiting Chicago in 1922.\nBorn to Filippo Di Giorgio and Giuseppa Casabianca in Borgetto, Sicily, in 1880,[1] Di Giorgio came to the United States around 1904. After a brief stay in New York City with his reported cousin, he moved to New Orleans. There, he married Maria Cristoforo on April 23, 1909, and joined the community of organized criminals. He was acknowledged as a cousin and a friend to New York City Mafia boss Giuseppe Morello, and with this connection became a leading Black Hander. It is not known when he joined the Honored Society; he may have been a member in Sicily. Using the alias of Joseph Caronia, he was arrested in 1908 for extortion. He was the leader of a Black Hand group that sent an extortion letter demanding money from a leading Italian grocer. He signed the letter \"King of the Mafia.\" He and his associates were freed after a short stay in jail due to lack of evidence. Further investigation showed that Di Giorgio killed a man, Joseph Campisciano, in self-defense about a year earlier. He had used the name Caronia at that time too.\nIn 1914 he became the owner of a grocery and saloon that was sold to him by the brother of the original proprietor. It had been a successful business and the press did not understand why the owner would sell it. It is likely that the owner, Henry Sciambra, was forced to sell. Sciambra's brother Anthony, the original owner, was murdered in 1912 by an intruder while he was in his home sleeping.\n",

His nickname derives from his purported propensity for burning his victims' bodies before crushing their bone fragments with a hammer.[1] After confessing to his crimes in May 2005, Bright was convicted of eight counts of murder and sentenced to eight life sentences without the possibility of parole.[2]\nNot long after 2000, Bright began to spend a great deal of free time around sex workers, taking particular interest in African-American women.[3][4]\nBetween March 2001 and October 15, 2004, the bodies of six women were found in rural areas around the Illinois counties of Peoria and Tazwell, and four other women were reported missing from the area. In October 2004, the Peoria City Police Department formed a task force of 13 police officers, with input from neighboring law enforcement agencies, to investigate the cases. Bright came under suspicion that December, after police arrested 35-year-old sex worker Vickie Bomar for theft. While residing in the county jail, the woman offered to help investigators in exchange for a plea bargain.\n",

He is considered to be an early, yet neglected, proponent of animal rights and ethical vegetarianism, and was a leading figure in the American humanitarian movement. Moore was a prolific writer, authoring numerous articles, books, essays, pamphlets on topics including animal rights, education, ethics, evolutionary biology, humanitarianism, socialism, temperance, utilitarianism and vegetarianism. He also lectured on many of these subjects and was widely regarded as a talented orator, earning the name the \"silver tongue of Kansas\" for his lectures on prohibition.\nMoore was born near Rockville, Indiana, in 1862 and spent his formative years in Linden, Missouri. Raised as a Christian, this instilled in him the anthropocentric belief that non-human animals existed for the benefit of humans. At college, Moore was introduced to Darwin's theory of evolution, which led him to develop an ethic that rejected both Christianity and anthropocentrism, and recognized the intrinsic value of animals; he adopted vegetarianism as an extension of this belief. While studying zoology at the University of Chicago, he became a socialist, helped form the university's Vegetarian Eating Club and won a national oratorical contest on prohibition. Moore was an influential member of the Chicago Vegetarian Society and attempted to model the organization as an American version of the Humanitarian League, a British organization that Moore was also a member of. In 1895, Moore delivered a speech that was published by the Chicago Vegetarian Society as Why I Am a Vegetarian. For the rest of his life, Moore worked as a teacher in Chicago, while continuing to lecture and write.\n",

Rardon said his parents treated him well. Asked about the murders, Rardon said, \"I had a perfect family. Too perfect. My father didn't drink, didn't run around, didn't neglect us.

But sometimes I felt I didn't live up to their expectations.\"[1]\nOn July 7, 1962, James Homer Smith, 23, who had just left the Marines, went into a train station in Indianapolis. When he asked if anyone needed a ride east, Rardon, then 19 and an AWOL sailor, said yes. Later that day, he shot Smith twice in the head and stuffed his body in the man's car. Smith's body was found 12 days later in Washington, Pennsylvania. On December 5, 1962, Rardon was arrested and charged with first degree murder. He claimed self-defense, saying Smith had made sexual advances towards him.[2][3] On April 19, 1963, Rardon pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 2 to 21 years in prison.

The school is decorated with murals and statues that portray Mexican culture and famous leaders.[4]\nPrior to the opening of Juarez, Pilsen area students attended Carter Harrison Technical High School.

Illinois (1968) doctrine, the Rehnquist Court considered challenges to the selection of jurors who would automatically vote to impose the death penalty on a defendant convicted of a capital offense.

Just as a juror who is unalterably opposed to the imposition of the death penalty must be excluded because he or she cannot conscientiously fulfill the oath to follow the law and the instructions to the jury pursuant thereto, so should one who would automatically vote to impose the death penalty be excluded for the same reason. Such a juror, he emphasized, would lack the qualities of impartiality and indifference required by due process. Furthermore, Justice White noted, jurors who would automatically vote to impose the death penalty would not \"in good faith ... consider evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances\" as may be required by law and included in jury instructions.[1]\n",

DeWolf was also a trustee at the Pasadena Art Institute.\nWallace Leroy DeWolf was born on February 24, 1854 in Chicago, Illinois. He was the son of Calvin DeWolf, a prominent lawyer and secretary of the Illinois chapter of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Wallace DeWolf attended Union College of Law at the University of Chicago, graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1876. He was admitted to the bar by the Supreme Court of Illinois. DeWolf opened a law office with his father in Chicago.[1]\n",

His body was not positively identified until 2011.[2] The case received national attention and was broadcast on several different television shows. Forensic evidence obtained from the body during the investigation was analyzed to assist in his future identification.[3] His case remains unprosecuted; the two main suspects were released on a bond, and promptly disappeared. Authorities believe the suspects fled to the Mexico City area.[4][5]\nIn October 2005, a small body was found in an unincorporated area alongside the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway (Interstate 88).[2][3][6][7] between Naperville and Warrenville, Illinois. The corpse was wrapped in a blue laundry bag and clothed in a blue button-down collared shirt with matching pants. The remains were decomposed beyond recognition, having been exposed to the elements for at least several weeks and possibly as long as one year.[4][8]\nThe medical examiner determined that the body was that of a Hispanic, Native American, or Asian male between three and five years of age.[8][9] The boy had black hair. However, due to the advanced decomposition of the body, eye color and cause of death could not be determined.[10] The body was interred following a grave-side service in October 2007. He was buried in a donated plot, accompanied by a teddy bear and a multi-design decorated blanket.[4][9][11]\n",

As a student at Harrison High School and later the University of Illinois at Chicago, he organized students to demand courses on Mexican history, and for more Latin faculty. In his 20s, Lozano became an organizer for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.[citation needed]\nIn 1982, Lozano entered the race for alderman of the 22nd Ward in the city's 1983 elections, in an attempt to be the first Mexican-American elected to the Chicago City Council. He faced longtime alderman Frank Stemberk and though Lozano was defeated, failing to force a runoff by seventeen votes,[3] he, along with his sister Emma Lozano, played an instrumental role in bringing Latino voters across the city to support candidate Harold Washington, who became Chicago's first African-American mayor.[4] His supporters alleged that voters with Spanish surnames were purged from the rolls, denying him the votes to force a runoff.[3] Lozano continued his work in the ILGWU, becoming the chief Midwest field organizer through his work with tortilla factory employees and other low-paid immigrant workers.\n",

Lee Epplen of the Chicago Police stated that Stachowicz and Gutierrez got into an argument after the woman harangued him about his sexuality, calling him and his roommate derogatory names, police and prosecutors said. Gutierrez told police he became enraged after Stachowicz kept questioning him, said Cook County Assistant State's Atty. Nancy Galassini during a bond hearing. Gutierrez claimed that she proceeded to ask him \"Why do you sleep with boys?\", after which he became even more angry and Nancy Galassini said \"The defendant punched and kicked and stabbed the victim until he was tired. He then placed a plastic garbage bag over her head and strangled her.\" He then continued to rape her.\nGutierrez later concealed her body in a crawlspace under the floor. Prosecutors also accused Gutierrez of sexually assaulting Stachowicz, a charge that was denied by his defense attorney.[3] In a confession videotaped by the Chicago Police, Gutierrez said he panicked because Stachowicz's trying to get him to change his sexuality reminded him of his mother. \"She had this sneer, which reminded me of my mother when she used to beat me...I saw nothing but red,\" Gutierrez was reported saying in the Chicago Sun-Times.[4] Later his defense attorney, Crystal Marchigiani, said that it was Gutierrez who had been physically attacked by Stachowicz, and that, \"She could not leave him alone.\"[3] Gutierrez was sentenced to life in prison on July 2, 2007.[5] His defense attorney asked the judge to account for his childhood history of physical abuse, but Stachowicz' son was 100% convinced that Gutierrez should receive the death penalty.[5]\n",

Gibson spent much of his early criminal career with the Central Park Gang based in Tulsa, Oklahoma which included the Barkers, Volney Davis, Ray Terrill and other local criminal figures. He participated in his first major robbery when he teamed with Neal Merritt and James \"Cowboy\" Long to rob a bank messenger in Oklahoma City of $75,000. Gibson was arrested for this robbery, but escaped from county jail prior to his trial.[1]\nHe later joined up with the Barker-Karpis gang and participated in numerous bank robberies with them. He, like the rest of the gang, was tracked down by the FBI during early 1935. Federal agents managed to trace him and his wife to a Chicago hideout used by the Barkers and raided the apartment building on January 8, 1935. The raid was bungled from the start as the FBI set off tear gas in the wrong apartment causing a panic among the tenants. When local police officers arrived on the scene, they nearly opened fire on federal agents who they believed were gangsters. Hoping to escape in the confusion, Gibson attempted to make it to the fire escape armed with a Browning automatic rifle and a .32 caliber pistol. FBI agents were waiting for Gibson however and opened fire. Although he was wearing a bulletproof vest, the agents' high-powered rifles killed him instantly.[2] His wife was arrested on charges of harboring a fugitive; two other gang members, Byron Bolton and Doc Barker, were also captured.[1]\n",

Stokes was 48 years old.[15][16]\nWillie Stokes garnered international notoriety for the arrangements he made for his son Willie the Wimp's funeral.[14] The younger Stokes followed his father's example trafficking narcotics and rivaled his dad's appetite for gambling.

Several $100 bills stuck out from between his fingers.\"[14][18]\nBill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth, of Austin, Texas were reading the Austin American-Statesman one morning and they read the syndicated column about Willie the Wimp. Carter said, \"I said to Ruth, 'This isn't a column\u2014it's a song'.\" They drove to the studio, and Carter said that \"in the two miles it took us to get there we put the column to music.\" Jimmie Vaughan was at the studio, and he called his brother, Stevie Ray Vaughan, to tell him about it.[18] Stevie liked the song, recorded it, and performed it live for his fans around the world.

The incident gained national coverage as it was initially believed that Gliniewicz was murdered by three unknown assailants. However, after two months of investigation, officials of the Lake County, Illinois Major Crimes Task Force[2] concluded that Gliniewicz had actually committed a staged suicide after realizing that his many years of criminal activity would soon be exposed.[3][4][5][6]\nJoe Gliniewicz was born in Libertyville, Illinois. He attended Marmion Military Academy and graduated from Antioch Community High School in Antioch, Illinois in 1981 before enlisting in the United States Army.[7] He was trained as a military police officer, drill sergeant, sniper, and in airborne assault.[8]\nIn 1985, he joined the Fox Lake Police Department (FLPD), the primary law enforcement agency for Fox Lake, Illinois, a village of about 10,000 nestled into the Chain O'Lakes that sits approximately 60 miles north of Chicago.[9] He was assigned as a patrol officer and received further training and certifications in special assignments including SWAT, police dog handling, and became a certified evidence technician. In 1996, he was promoted to sergeant and then lieutenant in 2006.[10] Gliniewicz was in command of the Fox Lake Police Explorer program Post 300,[11] an organization mentoring adolescents interested in law enforcement careers. \n",

        "paragraph": "The Ford Heights Four (Verneal Jimerson,[1] Dennis Williams,[2] Kenneth Adams[3] and Willie Rainge) were formerly imprisoned convicts, who were falsely accused and convicted of the double murder of Lawrence Lionberg and Carol Schmal in Ford Heights, Illinois, and later exonerated. Jimerson and Williams were sentenced to death, Adams to 75 years in jail and Rainge to life. Following the murder in 1978, the four spent almost two decades in prison before being released in 1996. This miscarriage of justice was due to false forensic testimony, coercion of a prosecution witness, perjury by another witness who had an incentive to lie, and prosecution and police misconduct. The DNA evidence uncovered in the investigation to clear their names eventually led to the arrest and conviction of the real killers.\nOn May 11, 1978, 28-year-old Lawrence Lionberg (who was working a night shift at a Homewood, Illinois, gas station) and his 23-year-old fianc\u00e9 Carol Schmal were kidnapped.  Schmal was raped several times and both were shot in the back of the head.[4]  There was a public outcry at the brutal murder.\nThe four suspects were tried in 1978. A witness, Charles McCraney, claimed to have seen  Williams, Rainge and Adams near the crime scene area in Ford Heights (at the time called East Chicago Heights) at the time of the crime. A state expert witness, Michael Podlecki, said that at least one of the rapists was type A secretor blood (shared by 25% of the population) and Williams and Adams had Type A secretor blood (an independent forensic witness found in 1987 that Williams and Adams actually had non-secretor blood). Podlecki also claimed that hairs from the back of Williams car were consistent with Lionberg and Schmal.[2] No other physical evidence matched the suspects to the crime. A convict, David Jackson, testified that he had overheard Williams and Rainge in jail discussing the murder and rape (Jackson later admitted he had fabricated this evidence because he was offered a deal by the authorities). The prosecution eliminated all black jurors from the trial (the defendants were all black and the murder victims were white).  The police did not inform the defense that a witness, Marvin Simpson, heard shots and identified four men running from the murder scene - Arthur Robinson, Juan Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson (these four were later found to be the real killers). Family members of the Ford Four testified they were elsewhere at the time of the murder.  The defendants' lawyer, Archie B. Weston, was ineffective, and was the subject of a legal disciplinary hearing at the time and was later disbarred from being a lawyer for another offense.  A witness, Paula Gray, (with an IQ of 55[5]), testified to prosecutors that she had seen the defendants shoot the victims and rape Schmal. However, she withdrew her evidence before the court case and prosecutors charged her with murder and perjury.  Williams was sentenced to death, while Adams was sentenced to 75 years, Rainge to life, and Paula Gray to 50 years in 1978. Jimerson could not be charged as McCraney had not mentioned Jimerson in his testimony and Paula Gray had withdrawn her testimony.[6]\n",

Two black men had been arrested as suspects in a rape, and attempted rape and murder. The alleged victims were two young white women and the father of one of them. When a mob seeking to lynch the men discovered the sheriff had transferred them out of the city, the whites furiously spread out to attack black neighborhoods, murdered black citizens on the streets, and destroyed black businesses and homes.  The state militia was called out to quell the rioting.\nThe riot, trials and aftermath are said to be one of the most well-documented examples of the complex intersection of race, class, and criminal justice in the United States.[1][2]  In 2008 an NPR report on the centenary of the race riot said that the fact of its taking place in a Northern state, specifically in \"The Land of Lincoln\", demonstrated that blacks were mistreated across the country, not just in the South, and described the event as a proxy for the story of race in America.[3]\nAt least sixteen people died as a result of the riot: nine black residents, and seven white residents who were associated with the mob, five of whom were killed by black residents and two committed suicide. It was misreported for decades that only militia were responsible for white deaths and that more whites than blacks had died. Personal and property damages, suffered overwhelmingly by blacks, amounted to more than $150,000 (approximately $4\u00a0million in 2018), as dozens of black homes and businesses were destroyed, as well as three white-owned businesses of suspected black sympathizers.[4][5][6]\n",

A prominent and well-known settler in the Iowa Territory, he was one of the earliest settlers in Rock Island.

During the next several years, he visited ports in the Baltic as well as in France, Spain, and Portugal. In the fall of 1803, shortly after arriving with a cargo from Liverpool, Davenport was arrested with the rest of his crew while in port at St. Petersburg when the Czarist Russian government acceded to Napoleon's embargo on British vessels (the \"Continental System\"). Davenport was imprisoned until the spring when he was released and allowed to return to his home country.[2]\nDavenport arrived in New York the following summer.  While in port, he suffered a severe leg injury during the rescue of a fellow sailor who had fallen overboard.

Shortly before his death, he confessed to the murders of twenty further young men and boys to his defense attorney Kathleen Zellner, although he denied being physically responsible for the actual murder of Bridges, which he insisted had been committed by an alleged accomplice in five of his homicides, Robert David Little.[8] With her client's consent,[9] Zellner posthumously released Eyler's confession following the formal announcement of his death.[10]\n",

With the Great Migration, thousands of African Americans from the American South had settled next to neighborhoods of European immigrants on Chicago's South Side near jobs in the stockyards, meatpacking plants, and industry. Meanwhile, the long-established Irish fiercely defended their neighborhoods and political power against all newcomers.[7][8] Post-World War I racism and social tensions built up in the competitive labor and housing markets.[9] Overcrowding and increased African American resistance against racism, especially by war veterans, contributed to the racial tension,[5] as well as white ethnic gangs unrestrained by police.[9]\n",

He began to perform locally but got lucky when his musical hero, Howlin' Wolf, allowed Jones to sit in with him at concerts. This influence, and the raw, gritty approach he had admired in the musical stylings of Sonny Boy Williamson, Muddy Waters, and Willie Dixon, made Jones concentrate on a \"low-down\" style of Chicago blues.[2][4]  Originally he was known as Crawlin' James, a nickname he acquired from his habit of crawling around on stage whilst performing. Later on, Howlin' Wolf named him Tail Dragger because Jones often arrived late for gigs.[2] By the early 1970s, Jones had become a full-time singer and he utilised notable backing musicians, including Willie Kent, Hubert Sumlin, Carey Bell, Kansas City Red,[5] Little Mack Simmons, Big Leon Brooks, and Eddie Shaw.[2]\n",

It was known for frequent malfunctions in the 1990s, namely in the cases of Jesse Tafero (executed May 4, 1990), Pedro Medina (executed March 25, 1997) and Allen Lee Davis (executed July 8, 1999). Reportedly, 6-inch flames shot out of Tafero's head and 12-inch flames shot out of Medina's head, raising the question whether use of the electric chair was \"cruel and unusual punishment\". After the Medina execution, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth commented, \"People who wish to commit murder, they'd better not do it in the state of Florida because we may have a problem with the electric chair.\"[5]\n",

The townspeople of Cairo formed a mob and murdered him, along with a second prisoner from the town jail whose trial had been delayed. The lynching drew crowds of thousands, and led the Illinois State Legislature to pass a series of anti-lynch and anti-mob laws that led to major reforms throughout the Midwest involving the sentencing and protections for African American people in Illinois. The lynching also mobilized advocacy groups in the state to push for more legal protections of African-American communities in smaller towns.\nCairo, Illinois, had been experiencing a surge of racial tension due to a crime wave at the end of 1909. The town police force was lethargic due in large part to the town economy being primarily based on vice-related activity.[5] Underground liquor establishments were common, and prostitution brought in considerable income. Most of the town's crime occurred in \"low-dens\" of the city, and involved organized crime. Racial tensions had been relatively low before the crime wave began. With the police force acting very slowly, the mob assembled and took matters into their own hands.\n",

        "paragraph": "The Spring Valley race riot of 1895 was a violent racial conflict between Eastern and Southern European immigrants and African American coal workers in the mining town of Spring Valley, Illinois. The conflict was in response to the robbery and shooting of Italian miner Barney Rollo, who reported that his assailants were five black men. The assault provoked the town's long-standing social and racial unrest, and many white immigrant workers united against the African American miners. During the investigation into the shooting several black miners were temporarily taken into custody for questioning and many white townspeople began to form a mob, demanding that all blacks be fired and removed from Spring Valley. The mine manager refused, which prompted the white miners to violently riot against both the black miners and their families, forcing them to flee to the nearby town of Princeton.\nIn the late 1840s, Illinois banned slavery in its state constitution. During this time enslaved people who had escaped from the Southern United States settled in Illinois, forming freedmen communities. Census data reflects that 5,436 free African Americans lived in Illinois in 1850, mostly in counties near the Southern border like Madison, St. Clair, and Sangamon.[1] Many white Illinoisans disliked the increasing free black population, which culminated in the 1853 promotion and passing of the Illinois Black Code, a bill that barred black people from migrating to or living in Illinois for over ten days, by Congress Democrat John A. Logan.[2] Despite the law, the population of free African Americans grew by nearly 71% in a decade, and by 1860, there were 7,628 freedmen in Illinois.[3] After the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment ultimately repealed the Black Code.[4] Social relations between the two groups remained tense, as \"most people of Illinois hated the very sight of a colored person.\"[2]\nHistorian Felix Armfield has stated that the state's racial tension meant that it would \"remain ripe for race wars,\" especially along the lines of labor in coal mining towns.[5] As black workers were typically brought into mining communities as strikebreakers, white and immigrant workers could not reclaim their jobs easily, resulting in labor unrest and sometimes violent, fatal outbursts. St. Clair County was the site of one of the first instances of unrest in February 1874.[5] Similarly, in April 1877, the coal town of Braidwood, Illinois, became the site of conflict along racial lines, along with Rapids City in January 1880 and Vermillion County in July 1886.[5] These conflicts largely coincided with the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of the nadir of American race relations, which was largely defined by violence against African Americans.\n",

Because of this, in their Canadian territories, the British treated those of French heritage more harshly. Several families, the first two being the families of Jean La Lime and Antoinne Ouillemette, fled to the Eschikagou (Chicago) area to escape the harsh treatment.[1] After trading along the frontier and likely in Detroit, La Lime arrived in the Chicago area on August 17, 1792 as an agent for William Burnett of Canada. In 1800, he purchased the homestead of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable for Burnett for 6,000 livres.[2] The bill of sale was filed in Detroit, Michigan on September 18, 1800, although dated in Chicago on May 7 of that year.[3]\nBy 1804, Burnett's partner, John Kinzie, who also settled in Chicago, had bought the former du Sable house.

If he stuck to this profession, he could have amounted to something honorable, but the lure of fast cash and cars and power quickly won over his mind as a way of life.[2]\n",

McDonald was a 17-year-old who was fatally shot by a Chicago Police Officer, Jason Van Dyke.[3][4] Police had initially reported that McDonald was behaving erratically while walking down the street, refusing to put down a knife, and that he had lunged at officers. Preliminary internal police reports described the incident similarly, leading to the shooting being judged as justifiable, and Van Dyke not being charged at the time.[5] This was later disproved after a video of the encounter was released, showing that McDonald was walking away.\nOn November 24, 2015, thirteen months after the shooting, a court ordered the police to release a dash cam video of the shooting. It showed that McDonald was walking away from the police when he was shot 16 times by Officer Van Dyke. That same day, Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder, and was initially held without bail at the Cook County Jail.[6] He was released on bail on November 30.[7] The city reached a settlement with McDonald's family for $5 million in April 2015. On October 5, 2018, Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder, as well as 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm.[8]\n",

Mayor Levi Boone, a Nativist politician, renewed enforcement of an old local ordinance mandating that taverns be closed on Sundays and led the city council to raise the cost of a liquor license from $50 per year to $300 per year, renewable quarterly.[1] The move was seen as targeting German immigrants in particular and so caused a greater sense of community within the group.[2]\nChicago's rapid growth in the 1840s and 1850s was largely because of German and Irish Catholic immigrants. Chicago was developing into an attractive opportunity for many immigrants.[3] Although the jobs that awaited the immigrant were often poor-paying wage based positions, opportunities were often more promising than that of their home country. The immigrants settled in their own neighborhoods, German immigrants congregating mainly on the North Side, across the Chicago River from City Hall and the older Protestant part of the city. The German settlers worked a six-day week, leaving Sunday as their primary day to socialize; much socialization took place in the small taverns that dotted the North Side of Chicago.[4] German-language newspapers, such as the Illinois Staats-Zeitung and social movements like the Turners and German craft unions gave the German population of Chicago a high degree of social and political cohesiveness.[5] Additionally, the Forty-Eighters among them had previously used demonstrations as a political tool during the European revolutions of 1848.\n",

His nickname was related to a childhood accident after a falling brick from a construction site had crushed his right hand, resulting in the loss of two fingers. Self-conscious of his deformed hand, White would wear a white glove in public with cotton stuffed in the empty fingers. \nIn 1919, he was convicted of robbery and served a prison sentence in Joliet Correctional Center until winning parole within four years.\nAn early member and much respected gunman of Johnny Torrio-Al Capone organization, White would be declared a public enemy in the Chicago Crime Commission's first published report in 1923 of those \"who are constantly in conflict with the law\" along with James \"Mad Bomber\" Belcastro, Edward O'Donnell,  Jake Guzik, and Al Capone. The following year, White was twice convicted for the murder of Forest Park policeman Edward Pflaume and, despite being released on appeal by the State Supreme Court; he was imprisoned for several years.\n",

His tenure is notable for his redesign of the Great Seal of the State of Illinois.\nBorn in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Tyndale moved to Belleville, Illinois in 1833 and worked in the mercantile business. He moved back to Philadelphia and worked in the mercantile business with his father. In 1845, he moved to Peoria, Illinois and studied to be a civil engineer. In 1857, Tyndale was elected County Surveyor of St. Clair County, Illinois. President Abraham Lincoln appointed Tyndale postmaster of Belleville, Illinois in 1861. From 1865 to 1869, Tyndale served as Illinois Secretary of State, as a Republican. After Tyndale left office, he stayed in Springfield, Illinois and worked for Gilman, Clinton and Springfield Railroad doing a survey. His brother was Hector Tyndale, a United States Army officer.[1]\nIn 1867, Tyndale himself requested that the Illinois General Assembly authorize a redesign of the seal, with one key suggestion, that the words of the motto (State Sovereignty, National Union) be reversed (to National Union, State Sovereignty). The legislature did authorize the redesign but specifically required the redesign to maintain the motto's word order. Then they gave Tyndale responsibility for the redesign. Tyndale overhauled the Great Seal, but he did so in a manner that appeared to thwart the legislature's intent. His new seal featured a twisted banner, which caused the word \"sovereignty\" to be upside down, albeit, in the order required by the legislature. Tyndale's banner has remained in place, with only minor changes, since 1868.[2]\n",

There must be absolute peace.\"[1] When the victims were discovered about half an hour later by a third JACL attendee sharing the hotel room, both girls had been stripped naked and bound, though neither showed evidence of being raped.[5] Yamada could not speak for two weeks after the incident due to her throat injury, but eventually recounted that the attacker had pranced around naked before killing Okubo.[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nWilliam George Heirens (November 15, 1928 \u2013 March 5, 2012) was an American criminal and possible serial killer who confessed to three murders. He was subsequently controversially convicted of the crimes in 1946. Heirens was called the Lipstick Killer after a notorious message scrawled in lipstick at a crime scene. At the time of his death, Heirens was reputedly Illinois' longest-serving prisoner, having spent 65 years in prison.[2]\nHe spent the later years of his sentence at the Dixon Correctional Center in Dixon, Illinois. Though he remained imprisoned until his death, Heirens had recanted his confession and claimed to be a victim of coercive interrogation and police brutality.[3]\n",

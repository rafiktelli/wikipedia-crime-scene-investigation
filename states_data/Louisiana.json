        "paragraph": "Willie Francis (January 12, 1929 \u2013 May 9, 1947) was an African American teenager known for surviving a failed execution by electrocution in the United States.[1]  He was a juvenile offender sentenced to death at age 16 by the state of Louisiana in 1945 for the murder of Andrew Thomas, a Cajun pharmacy owner in St. Martinville who had once employed him. He was 17 when he survived the first attempt to execute him, as the chair malfunctioned. After an appeal of his case taken to the US Supreme Court failed, he was executed in 1947 at age 18.\nIn 1944, Andrew Thomas, a pharmacist in St. Martinville, Louisiana, was shot and killed. His murder remained unsolved for nine months, but in August 1945, Willie Francis was detained in Texas due to his proximity to an unrelated crime. Police claimed that he was carrying Thomas' wallet in his pocket, though no evidence of this claim was submitted during the trial.[2]\nFrancis initially named several others in connection with the murder, but the police dismissed these claims. A short time later, while under interrogation, Francis confessed to Thomas' murder, writing, \"It was a secret about me and him.\"  He had no counsel with him.[3] The meaning of his statement is still uncertain. Author Gilbert King, in his book, The Execution of Willie Francis (2008), alludes to rumors in St. Martinville of sexual abuse of the youth by the pharmacist. Francis later directed the police to where he had disposed of the holster used to carry the murder weapon. The gun used to kill Thomas was found near the crime scene. It belonged to a deputy sheriff in St. Martinville who had once threatened to kill Thomas. The gun, and the bullets recovered from the crime scene and Thomas' body, disappeared from police evidence just before the trial.\n",

The event sparked a major race riot in 1900; known as the Robert Charles riots.[2]\nOn Monday, July 23, 1900, Charles sat on the front steps of a house in New Orleans talking with a friend, while waiting to rendezvous with his girlfriend, Virginia Banks, who lived on the block.[3] Three white police officers, Sergeant Jules C. Aucion, August T. Mora, and Joseph D. Cantrelle, investigated reports of \"two suspicious looking negroes\" sitting on a porch in a predominantly white neighborhood. They found Robert Charles and his roommate, 19-year-old Leonard Pierce, at the scene. The policemen questioned the two men, demanding to know what they \"were doing and how long they had been there.\" One of the two men replied that they were \"waiting for a friend.\" Charles stood up, which the police took as an aggressive move. Mora grabbed him and the two struggled. Mora hit Charles with his billy club. Mora and Charles pulled guns and exchanged shots. Reports vary on who drew first; both men received non-lethal gunshot wounds to the legs. Charles fled to his residence, leaving a trail of blood.[4]\nAt Charles' residence, two officers, Officer Lamb and Captain Day, arrived and attempted to arrest Charles, but he brandished a rifle and shot and killed them both.[5] Charles then fled on foot and the police initiated a manhunt.\n",

In 2007, an unidentified intruder shot and killed her in her New Orleans home. Her death (one of six murders in the city that day), coupled with the murder a week before of New Orleans musician Dinerral Shavers, sparked civic outrage. Thousands marched against the rampant and continuing post-Katrina violence in New Orleans. This \"March Against Violence on City Hall\" drew significant press coverage throughout the United States and beyond. However, in the years following that tragic notoriety, Helen Hill's life and creative work have been widely celebrated, with her films continuing to circulate to a degree they did not during her lifetime. In 2012, Daniel Eagan wrote about Helen Hill as one of \"Five Women Animators Who Shook Up the Industry\".[2]\nHelen Hill was a native of Columbia, South Carolina, where she lived until graduating from Dreher High School in 1988. She identified herself as a Southerner (although after marrying Paul Gailiunas, a Canadian citizen originally from Edmonton, Alberta, she later became a dual US-Canadian citizen) and had deep roots in her home city of Columbia. Her mother, Becky, named her Helen Wingard Hill after her own mother, Helen Addison Wingard, another Columbian.\n",

Born in Indianapolis on May 3, 1974, his troubles began as early as age 3, when one of his uncles began molesting him.[4] In the ensuing years, he constantly got in trouble with police due to small-time crimes, but could not be prosecuted due to his young age. In an attempt to help him, he was first sent to a mental hospital at age 9, and for a few years was shuffled between various institutions in Michigan, Chicago and Arizona.[4] At age 10, he was convicted of raping a 35-year-old staff worker at one of the hospitals he was interned in. However, despite his violent record, Matthews was released and returned to Indianapolis, graduating from Lawrence Central High School. He was known as a charming, but very violent, character, who nonetheless had no trouble maintaining relationships with women.[4]\nIn June 1994, Matthews was working at a pancake house in Castleton, together with a 19-year-old co-worker named Kenya L. Willis. Around this time, Willis vanished mysteriously, and has not been located to this very day. At the time, Matthews was not suspected, and the circumstances surrounding this case remained unclear until his arrest.[4] Around the same time, Matthews' 18-year-old live-in girlfriend, Christina Darnell, had moved in with him at his Indianapolis apartment to look after their 3-year-old daughter, Erica. However, Matthews began beating her on a regular basis, causing Darnell to send their daughter away to live at her parents' home in Madison, Alabama.[5] Against her mother's wishes, she decided to stay with Matthews, keeping in contact with her mother and daughter by talking to them on the phone every day. On October 1, Darnell's mother, who had not heard from her in three days, finally reported her as missing. The authorities went to Matthews' household, and after interrogation, he admitted that the pair had been in a fight on August 29, but claimed that Darnell had taken $700 and simply left.[6] At a later interview with The Indianapolis Star, he continued to proclaim his innocence and pointed to the fact that all leads for the case were essentially provided by him, since he was the one who filed the missing persons report.[6] While Darnell's family members were highly suspicious of Matthews' involvement in the case, he could not be arrested at the time due to lack of evidence, coupled with the fact that the possibility that Darnell, who suffered from a dissociative identity disorder, could have been interned at a psychiatric institution for treatment.[4] In spite of their efforts to locate her, her trail went cold.[6]\n",

After working as a traveling salesman and briefly attending three colleges, he was admitted to the bar in Louisiana. Following a short career as an attorney, in which he frequently represented poor plaintiffs, Long was elected to the Louisiana Public Service Commission. As Commissioner, he prosecuted large corporations such as Standard Oil, a lifelong target of his rhetorical attacks.

When he entered Louisiana State Prison (Angola), he was the youngest person on death row.\nIn 1976 the United States Supreme Court ruled in Roberts v. Louisiana that the state's death penalty law was unconstitutional, as it required mandatory sentences for convictions of certain capital charges, without consideration of mitigating factors. The Supreme Court ordered state court reviews and the commutation of sentences of persons on death row to the next lower level of punishment. Tyler's sentence was commuted to life in prison without parole for 20 years. \nHis defense appealed the conviction. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in 1980 that Tyler's trial had convicted him on \"unconstitutional charges\" and was \"fundamentally unfair\"; it remanded the case to the lower courts and ordered a new trial. But on state appeal, it changed its ruling in 1981, saying that attorney error by Tyler's original defense counsel did not allow redress. Tyler was recommended by the state parole board for a pardon, but governors had failed to act on this. \n",

He was tried, convicted, and executed in the electric chair in Louisiana for the murder of Tumekica Jackson. He was the last inmate to die in Louisiana's infamous electric chair, \"Gruesome Gertie\".\nOn February 17, 1984, eleven-year-old Tumekica Jackson was living with her mother and her grandparents in the Scotlandville area of Baton Rouge. At 4:00\u00a0a.m., the grandmother discovered that Tumekica was missing from her bedroom. The police discovered that someone had broken the screen of the rear den window and had opened the back door. In the muddy ground near the house, police obtained a cast of an imprint made by the left shoe from a pair of size 8\u2153 tennis shoes. There were no signs of a struggle inside the house.\nThe investigation immediately focused on Jones because his stormy romantic relationship of several years with Tumekica's mother had been broken off by her the week before. Tumekica knew Jones well, and he had been in the home many times. On the evening of Tumekica's disappearance, Jones had called the mother's home three times and had told the grandmother that he would not be responsible for his actions if the mother continued to refuse to see him.\n",

In 1974, Bickham's death sentence was converted to life without parole after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Furman v. Georgia, which invalidated death penalty convictions in certain circumstances.[2]  In April, 1995, through a detailed legal challenge to Bickham's 1958 conviction, the Governor of Louisiana consented to commute Bickham's sentence to 75 years.  Several months later, Bickham's attorney won a full release, and Bickham left Angola State Penitentiary in January, 1996, after 37 1/2 years in prison.  Bickham lived the rest of his life in California, and died in hospice care in Alameda, California after a short illness, at the age of 98.[1]\nBorn in 1917, the grandson of enslaved Africans, Bickham lived most of his life in Mississippi and Louisiana. He served in the United States Navy in World War II, stationed at Pearl Harbor.\nIn 1958, Bickham lived in Mandeville, Louisiana, a town north of New Orleans. According to trial transcripts, at around 11 pm on the evening of July 12, 1958, Bickham became drawn into an argument with two sheriff's deputies in a bar called \"Buck's Place\" in Mandeville.  At trial, prosecutors submitted evidence that Bickham's girlfriend, Florence Spencer, had been \"acting unruly.\"  At approximately 11 pm the two deputies\u2014Gus Gill, 68, and Jake Galloway, 74\u2014drove Spencer home.  The deputies wore street clothes, and many in the community reported that they believed the two deputies were associated with the Ku Klux Klan, something not unusual for law enforcement personnel in a small, rural town in 1958 Louisiana.\n",

During negotiations, state police superintendent, Colonel Mike Edmonson, located a friend of Ahmed's in Alaska, who talked him into releasing one of the hostages, Patricia White. According to Edmondson, Ahmed was \"mad at people that he said were mean to him. He had voices in his head.\"[4] Authorities said that Ahmed believed the family of his ex-girlfriend in Lake Providence had caused their breakup and had placed a \"microphone device\" of some kind in his head.[5][6]\nEventually, Ahmed shot the remaining two hostages. Warbington died at the scene, while McDaniel was critically wounded and died two days later at Rapides Regional Medical Center in Alexandria.[6] Soon afterward, the Louisiana State Police broke into the bank and fatally shot Ahmed.[1][4] It did not appear that Ahmed knew the hostages,[1] but the hostages recognized him.[5]\n",

His 17-year-old cousin Albert Harris, Jr. was tortured and left for dead alongside Jones. This was the only known post-World War II lynching to occur in Louisiana, and it involved multiple well-known local individuals, politicians, and a cover-up by multiple law enforcement entities.[1]\nOn the night of July 30, 1946, a pregnant woman complained to her husband that she had been startled by a prowler in their yard. The next day, the husband looked around his yard and found that a window screen had been tampered with, along with some grass and a portion of the fence that surrounded the yard. He looked to the neighboring house and saw Albert Harris, Jr. holding a stick and sitting on the front porch. The husband talked to his father, and ultimately two civilians and two Webster Parish Sheriff's Deputies went to the Harris house and arrested Albert, Jr. He was held in jail for a few days without charge and released by Webster Parish Deputy Sheriff O.H. Haynes, Jr. in Dixie Inn to a mob. The mob took Albert, Jr. to a field in rural Webster Parish, tied him upside down to a pipe, covered his head, and at gunpoint, they forced him by way of multiple beatings to implicate his cousin (Jones) as an accomplice in the alleged prowling. After Albert, Jr. was released by the mob, his parents sent him out of the state. On August 3, 1946, two deputies, including Haynes, went to the Harris' house to procure Albert, Jr. One of the deputies smashed Albert Harris, Sr.'s jaw and told him to bring Albert, Jr. back into custody. Albert, Jr. was returned to the sheriff's custody August 4. Jones had been arrested on August 3 in connection with the matter. While both men were in jail, they were questioned by the husband's father and deputies. They were also beaten by deputies. They were held several days without charge.[2]\nOn the night of August 8, 1946, both men were released by Deputy Sheriff O.H. Haynes, Jr. to a mob in front of the jail. Almost immediately upon release, Jones understood what was happening and began to protest, but he was hit over the head with the butt of a gun, knocking him unconscious and limp. He had to be carried under the arms and loaded into one of the mob's two idling cars. They were driven outside of Minden to a private pond, where they were tortured and mutilated with clubs, sticks, strops, and a blowtorch. Despite the violence, Albert, Jr. had not been done in, and he awoke to the cries and moans of his cousin. Jones asked Albert to get him some water, and to take care of his German pistol that he had brought back from Germany. Jones died in Albert's arms after about 5 minutes. Albert walked for miles into Minden, hiding from passing cars. When stopped by a Minden Police car, the officers obviously had been apprised of what had happened because they asked him where the \"other boy was.\" Albert went to a family member's house in Minden, and ultimately escaped to Chicago and then Detroit.[3]\n",

It was a crucial event in attempts to organize locals and unionize sawmill workers in Louisiana and east Texas in a series of events known as the Louisiana-Texas Lumber War of 1911-1912.\nThere had been unrest for years in western Louisiana and eastern Texas as workers tried to organize to gain better conditions in the industry. At Grabow the main factions involved were the Galloway Lumber Company and a party of striking unionized mill workers and their supporters. The union workers were known as the Brotherhood of Timber Workers (BTW),[1] a branch of the Lumber Workers Industrial Union (LWIU), which was affiliated with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The Brotherhood tried to recruit mill workers by giving speeches and conducting meetings at various mills. Although they had limited success in Louisiana, the LWIU became very successful from 1917 to 1924. \nIn October 1940, Congress passed the Wages and Hours Act (later the Fair Labor Standards Act); this was upheld by the United States Supreme Court on February 3, 1941.\n",

After the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that states had to rework their death penalty statutes because of constitutional concerns, the Louisiana Court judicially amended his sentence in 1972 to life in prison.\nDuring his 12 years on death row, Rideau had begun to educate himself, by reading numerous books. After being returned to the general prison population, from 1975 Rideau served for more than 20 years as editor of The Angolite, the magazine written and published by prisoners at Louisiana State Prison (Angola); he was the first African-American editor of any prison newspaper in the United States. Under his leadership, the magazine won the George Polk Award and Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for its reporting, and it was nominated for others.\nRideau appealed his case four times. The Supreme Court of the United States and lower courts ordered a total of three new trials; SCOTUS overturned his conviction and ordered a new trial because of adverse pre-trial publicity. He was convicted again of murder two more times, in 1964 and 1970, each time by all-male, all-white juries.[1] He served more than 40 years in the State Penitentiary; parole was never approved. In 2005 Rideau was tried a fourth time. He was unanimously convicted by the jury of the lesser charge of manslaughter; they did not believe he had planned the killing.

His debut album Fours Deuces & Trays was released in 1994 on New Orleans independent rap label Big Boy Records and was produced by Leroy \"Precise\" Edwards. Fours Deuces & Trays was a huge success and he was on the verge of signing a major deal with Relativity Records in 1995-1997. He was shot and killed in a triple shooting in 1996, before he could sign to Relativity.[1]\nBorn Kenneth Jackson Jr. in 1975, he was raised in the Christopher Homes area which is located in the  Algiers neighborhood of New Orleans. As a teenager he began rapping and was discovered by Charles \"Big Boy\" Temple in 1992. He was signed the next year to Big Boy Records along with Mystikal, Black Menace and Partners-N-Crime. Jackson dropped k from his name adopting the G and began doing features as G-Slimm. His debut album Fours Deuces & Trays was released on September 3, 1994, and featured, Mystikal who also made his debut on the album. Leroy \"Precise\" Edwards produced the tracks on the album, giving it a West Coast southern feel.[2] The album sold well over 200,000 copies the first month, becoming the most acclaimed local rap albums of 1994.[3][4][5] Due to the identical track layout format, it was often compared with Dr. Dre.'s The Chronic album. It was the first album produced in New Orleans to have a California G-Funk sound, relevant to G-Funk area of the mid 1990s. The following year Jackson was offered a deal by Relativity Records. While working on his sophomore album titled G-Slimm for Relativity, he was murdered before it hit the stores. His last feature was with close friend rapper Tim Smooth on his album \"Da Franchise.\" Da Franchise was released in 1998 two years after his death.[6] G-Slimm's vocals was also featured on Big Boy's 1997 compilation album \"We G's\".[7]\nOn October 13, 1996, Jackson and three other men were walking from the Christopher Homes Housing Development on Murl Street when unknown gunmen fired shots at them at 1:30 pm. All three men were hit including G-Slimm who shot once in the back. Jackson was later pronounced dead at 2:14 pm at Charity Hospital.[8][9][10]\n",

For the fatal shooting, Plauch\u00e9 was given a seven-year suspended sentence with five years' probation and 300 hours of community service and received no prison time. The case received wide publicity because some people questioned whether Plauch\u00e9 should have been charged with murder or let off. Plauch\u00e9 contended that he was in the right, and that anyone in a similar position would have taken the same action.[1]\nGary Plauch\u00e9 lived in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He was separated from his wife, June, at the time of the shooting. During 1983 and 1984, his 11-year-old son, Jody Plauch\u00e9, was taking karate lessons with an instructor, 25-year-old Jeffrey Doucet, who had been sexually abusing the boy for at least a year. In February 1984, Doucet kidnapped Jody and took him to a motel in Anaheim, California, where he sexually assaulted and molested him. Police searched the country for Jody, and he was eventually found after Doucet allowed the boy to place a collect call to his mother from the motel.[2] California police raided the motel and arrested Doucet without incident.[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "Antonio G. James (c. 1954 \u2013 March 1, 1996) was an American murderer. He was tried and executed in Louisiana for the murder of Henry Silver. James claims to have not been the murderer in the event and held that conviction to his death. This case is notable not for any unusual or intrinsic aspect, but for being one of the few such cases that ever comes to the attention of the general public.\nLike the case of Edward Earl Johnson whose last days on death row in Mississippi were filmed for the BBC in 1987 as Fourteen Days in May, this case came to light precisely because it was so ordinary, and was seen to be so. To some it demonstrated the need for capital punishment to protect the public from such dangerous people. To others it demonstrated the inhumanity of death row. Whatever conclusions were reached, this case remains one of the few such cases in the public domain that does not involve a celebrity perpetrator or victim, and so reminds all concerned of nature of most capital cases in the United States.[1]\nJames had amassed a very extensive juvenile and criminal record by the time he was tried for the murder of Silver. The post-sentence investigation report prepared for the sentencing court listed 37 juvenile incidents. James was ordered confined to the Louisiana Training Institute at age 14. In 1973, he was convicted of attempted armed robbery and sentenced to serve three years at the state penitentiary. During this period of confinement, he was convicted of attempted simple escape. He was released in 1975. In 1978, he was charged with aggravated rape, but the charge was later refused by the prosecution. James was convicted of the January 23, 1979, first degree murder of Alvin Adams and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was convicted of the January 26, 1979, armed robbery of Robert Hooten and was sentenced to 99 years for this offense, the maximum under Louisiana law.[citation needed]\n",

Following their arrest, both Williams and his wife gave confessions, implicating themselves in the crime.[3]\nWilliams was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death by District Judge Frank Foil on May 30, 1979.[4] The jury recommended that Holmes receive a life term for his role in the crime.[5] Williams consistently maintained that the gun had gone off accidentally and that he had not intended to shoot Kelly.[6] However, he did not testify at his own trial.[7]\n",

Williams' execution was twice stayed and his sentence was overturned by a federal district court judge.

It ruled that the execution had to proceed, under the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).[1]\nIn 2005, Williams was one of two subjects of a book by Sister Helen Prejean, a Catholic nun and anti-death penalty activist. She contended that Williams could not have possibly committed the murder and was wrongfully convicted and executed. She believed that he had ineffective legal counsel; his lawyer was later disbarred for incompetence.[1] She also notes that poor and minority people are disproportionately sentenced to death and executed in the United States criminal justice system.\n",

[4] The violence erupted outside the Mechanics Institute, site of a reconvened Louisiana Constitutional Convention. The Republican Party of Louisiana had called for the Convention, as they were angered by the legislature's enactment of the Black Codes and refusal to extend voting rights to Black men. White Democrats considered the reconvened convention to be illegal and were hostile towards Republican attempts to gain increased political power in the state. The massacre \"stemmed from deeply rooted political, social, and economic causes,\"[5] and took place in part because of the battle \"between two opposing factions for power and office.\"[5] According to the official report, a total of 38 were killed and 146 wounded, of whom 34 dead and 119 wounded were Black Freedmen. Unofficial estimates were higher.[6] Gilles Vandal estimated 40 to 50 Black Americans were killed and more than 150 Black Americans wounded.[7] Others have claimed nearly 200 were killed.[8] In addition, three white convention attendees were killed, as was one white protester.[9]\nDuring much of the American Civil War, New Orleans had been occupied and under martial law imposed by the Union. On May 12, 1866, Mayor John T. Monroe, a Democrat who had ardently supported the Confederacy, was reinstated as acting mayor, the position he held before the war. Judge R. K. Howell was elected as chairman of the convention, with the goal of increasing participation by voters likely to vote for removal of the Black Codes.[10]\nThe massacre expressed conflicts deeply rooted in the social structure of Louisiana. It was a continuation of the war: more than half of the whites were Confederate veterans and nearly half of the Black Americans were veterans of the Union army. The national reaction of outrage at the earlier Memphis riots of 1866 and the New Orleans Massacre helped the Radical Republicans win a majority in both houses of Congress in the 1866 midterm elections. The riots catalyzed support for the Fourteenth Amendment, extending suffrage and full citizenship to freedmen, and the Reconstruction Act, to establish military districts for the national government to oversee areas of the South and work to change their social arrangements.\n",

        "paragraph": "Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 459 (1947), is a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court was asked whether imposing capital punishment (the electric chair) a second time, after it failed in an attempt to execute Willie Francis in 1946,[1] constituted a violation of the United States Constitution. The issues raised surrounded the double jeopardy clause of the 5th Amendment, and the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the 8th Amendment, as made applicable to the State of Louisiana via the due process clause of the 14th Amendment.\nIn an opinion by Justice Stanley Forman Reed, which three other justices (Chief Justice Vinson and Associate Justices Hugo Black and Robert H. Jackson) joined, and with which Justice Felix Frankfurter concurred, the Court held that re-executing Francis did not constitute double jeopardy or cruel and unusual punishment.  Justice Reed wrote,\nOur minds rebel against permitting the same sovereignty to punish an accused twice for the same offense. But where the accused successfully seeks review of a conviction, there is no double jeopardy upon a new trial. Even where a state obtains a new trial after conviction because of errors, while an accused may be placed on trial a second time, it is not the sort of hardship to the accused that is forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment ... For we see no difference from a constitutional point of view between a new trial for error of law at the instance of the state that results in a death sentence instead of imprisonment for life and an execution that follows a failure of equipment. When an accident, with no suggestion of malevolence, prevents the consummation of a sentence, the state's subsequent course in the administration of its criminal law is not affected on that account by any requirement of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment. We find no double jeopardy here which can be said to amount to a denial of federal due process in the proposed execution. (Citations omitted).",

He attended University of South Carolina and in 2006 suffered severe burns from an arson attack at a house he was staying at. He went on to attend Winthrop University, finishing in 2011. That fall he appeared at Occupy Eugene. Back in Charleston he found and joined the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith around 2014 and soon was visible in the news following the shooting of Walter Scott and being known as a Black Lives Matter activist in 2015. After some more work in 2016 Moye became involved in a February 2017 Bree Newsome speaking engagement that drew protestors and counter protestors during which he made a leap crossing police lines to take down an oversized Confederate battle flag that happened to occur during a news broadcast and so was caught on live television. A year later Moye went to New Orleans and while riding a bicycle through the midnight streets on February 6, 2018, he was shot, traveled on some blocks, left his bike and called for help to which police responded and took him to the hospital. However he had lost too much blood and died in the morning.\n",

He participated as a principal in a duel with the former mayor of New Orleans, Denis Prieur, a political adversary, and received injuries from which he died in New Orleans in 1843; interment was in Girod Street Cemetery.\nIn 1840, Waggaman's daughter Christine eloped with a young Canadian lawyer, John Sandfield Macdonald, who made regular trips to Washington on behalf of the government of Upper Canada as Queen's messenger. She joined Macdonald in Upper Canada. He would go on to be joint Premier of the Province of Canada and the first Premier of Ontario.[1]\n",

It is the only female correctional facility of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections. Elayn Hunt Correctional Center is immediately west of LCIW.[1] LCIW includes the state's female death row.[2] As of 2017[update] the prison has temporarily moved due to flooding that occurred in August 2016, and its prisoners are housed in other prisons. The administration is temporarily located in the former Jetson Youth Center near Baker.   By 2021 the Baker area address was given for the prison on the LCIW website.[3]\nIn 1961 the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women opened on the grounds of a former prison farm camp. Female inmates were moved from the Louisiana State Penitentiary (Angola) to LCIW.[4] A 200 bed dormitory intended to alleviate an overcrowding of female prisoners was scheduled to open in the northern hemisphere spring of 1995.[5] In 1995 the state received federal approval for its plan to double-bunk inmates. That way the state could transfer state-sentenced female prisoners who were held in parish jails to the women's prison.[6] The television special 900 Women: Inside St. Gabriel's Prison is about the women inside the facility.[7]\nIn August 2016 the facility, which had 985 prisoners,[8] experienced flooding, ranging from 8\u00a0in (20.3\u00a0cm) \nto 3\u00a0ft (0.91\u00a0m).[9] LCIW, the only state-operated prison to receive flooding during that incident, temporarily closed.[8] It was the first time in state history that the whole population of a particular prison was evacuated to other facilities.[10] The chapel and one other building did not flood.\n",

According to author Chuck Hustmyre, Frank was caught lying on several sections of her employment application and failed two standard psychiatric evaluations, with psychiatrist Philip Scurria advising against her hiring. Despite this, Frank got a second chance to apply. The NOPD was chronically short-handed; at the time, its officers were paid less than in similarly sized cities, it was losing officers faster than they could be replaced, and the ranks had been decimated by several arrests for murder and drug activity. Many potential applicants were shut out due to a requirement that all officers be residents of New Orleans \u2013 a requirement that was only changed in 2014. NOPD officials also thought having more African-Americans like Frank on the force would ease longstanding racial tensions in the majority-black city.

They assassinated six white Republicans and five to 20 freedmen who were witnesses.[1][2]\nThe White League had organized to restore white supremacy by driving Republicans out of Louisiana, disrupting their political organizing, and intimidating or murdering freedmen.[3]  Like the Red Shirts and other \"White Line\" organizations, they were described as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"\nIn the period after the American Civil War, Marshall H. Twitchell, a Union veteran from Vermont who had led United States Colored Troops, passed an administrative examination and came to Red River Parish, Louisiana to become an agent for the Freedmen's Bureau.  He married Adele Coleman, a young local woman. Her family taught him about cotton farming. In 1870, Twitchell was elected as a Republican to the Louisiana State Senate. He appointed his brother and three brothers-in-law (the latter natives of the parish) to local positions, including sheriff, tax assessor and clerk of court.  Twitchell worked to promote education and to extend public representation and civil rights to the former slaves, known as freedmen.[1]\n",

Kallio's wrestling career peaked in the 1920s and 1930s where he was known as the \"King of the Welterweights\" and later on \"King of the Middleweights\" as he held multiple world titles in those two weight divisions.\nGustav Kallio was born as August Hassinen in 1891 in Karttula, Finland.[6] He immigrated to the United States with his brother Issac Hassinen in 1913[6][7] when both were in their early 20s. Issac moved on to Canada, while Gus stayed in the US wrestling under the name Gus Kallio.\nKallio was about 15 years old when Kallio and his father attended a professional wrestling event that featured Billy Sandow, a successful middleweight wrestler that participated in Barnstorming tours. Seeing the success of the relatively small Sandow inspired Kallio to become a wrestler himself.[3] Kallio made his debut in 1916 under the name \"Gus Kallio\" (some placed he was billed as \"Gust Kallio\") and began competing in the Welterweight division,[5] a weight class with a top weight limit of 155\u00a0lb (70\u00a0kg). Kallio's conditioning earned him the nickname \"the Finnish strong boy\".[8] On October 3, 1921 Kallio defeated Jack Reynolds to win the National Wrestling Association's World Welterweight Championship.[9] Kallio retained the title through at least 1923, earning the nickname \"the Welterweight King\".[9][10] During the 1920s Kallio often travelled around the United States, facing regional champions such as the Navy champion Jack Rich, Royal Van Dusen or Canadian Champion .[10] On August 7, 1928, Kallio became the top Middleweight in the world, defeating Charlie Fisher to become the World Middleweight Champion in two and a half hour long match.[11] Kallio later proved his incredible condition when he wrestled Henry Jones in a three-hour match before winning the bout.[12]\n",

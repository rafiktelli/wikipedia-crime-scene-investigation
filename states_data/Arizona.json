        "paragraph": "Mark Goudeau (born September 6, 1964) is an American serial killer, kidnapper, thief and rapist. Goudeau terrorized victims in the Phoenix metro area between August 2005 and June 2006; coincidentally, Goudeau was active at the same time as two other Phoenix serial killers, jointly known as the \"Serial Shooter.\u201d\nIn addition to committing nine murders, his extensive crime spree included 84 other felony crimes, totaling 93 felonies over the ten-month period. He faced two separate trials\u2014one for 19 charges related to an attack on two sisters whom he raped and sexually assaulted, and another related to 74 more charges including murder, robbery, rape, kidnapping, sexual abuse and/or assault of minors and adults. All but one of his victims were females. Goudeau was convicted on a total of 76 of 93 crimes, and was sentenced to death 9 times (one for each murder conviction) and given a sum total of 1,634 years in Arizona state prison.\nGoudeau was first referred to as the Baseline Rapist when Phoenix Police announced that a light-skinned black male was sexually assaulting females as young as 12 years old at gunpoint near Baseline Road. Goudeau would later be dubbed the Baseline Killer in the spring of 2006 after investigators linked him to a series of murders and armed robberies. The crimes later spread north, primarily in the North Central area of Phoenix, Arizona.\n",

Four men were killed during the shootout, including three lawmen and Jeff Power, the owner of the cabin. The Power brothers, Tom and John, then escaped to Mexico with a man named Tom Sisson, but they were eventually caught after what was then the largest manhunt in the history of Arizona.[1][2]\nThe Power family composed of \"Old Man\" Jeff, the father, his wife, Martha, three sons; Charles, John, and Tom, and one daughter; Ola May. They were originally from Texas, but moved to Arizona Territory in 1909 and homesteaded in lower Rattlesnake Canyon, south of Klondyke. Two years later, Charles bought a nearby goat ranch, which is now known as Power's Garden, and the family moved there. After improving the ranch by adding more rooms to the cabin, the Powers began importing cattle. Life was not easy though; the Powers family lived \"in what was still a rough and occasionally violent frontier,\" so the brothers often had to find work at the neighboring ranches or mines.[1][3]\nIn 1915, Martha Power was killed in a horse and buggy accident and by 1917 the cattle ranch had been sold and Charles had moved away to New Mexico. Later that year, Jeff Power purchased Perry Tucker's one-quarter interest in the Abandoned Claims, an old gold mine in nearby Keilberg Canyon, which is now known as Power's Mine. Hard workers, the Power family and a friend named Tom Sisson built a twenty-five mile wagon road \"through some of the roughest country imaginable\" to their mine. The road ran from the Haby Ranch, several miles north of Klondyke on Aravaipa Creek, south for about twelve miles before dropping down Power's Hill into Rattlesnake Canyon, then up the canyon to the Abandoned Claims at Keilberg Canyon. Sisson and the Powers\nbuilt a cabin to live in and, when they were in control of three-quarters of the property, they purchased a second-hand stamp mill.[1][3][4]\n",

Arizona, 497 U.S. 639 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court case that upheld two important aspects of  the capital sentencing scheme in Arizona\u2014judicial sentencing and the aggravating factor \"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved\"\u2014as not unconstitutionally vague. The Court overruled the first of these holdings in Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002). The second of these holdings has yet to be overturned.\nOn the night of March 2, 1986, Walton and his two codefendants entered a bar in Tucson, Arizona, set on finding someone at random to rob, kidnap, and leave stranded in the desert. The person they chose was Thomas Powell, an off-duty Marine.  The three robbed Powell at gunpoint and forced him into his car. Then they drove him out into the desert.  While Walton's codefendants sat in the car with the radio turned up, Walton and Powell marched out into the desert.  Walton threw Powell down on the ground and shot him once in the head. Walton bragged to his co-defendants that he had \"never seen a man pee in his pants before.\" After Walton was arrested a week later, he led the police to Powell's body. The medical examiner revealed that Powell did not die instantly from the gunshot; rather, he had been blinded and rendered unconscious by the gunshot, and only died six days later from dehydration, starvation, and pneumonia.  \nA jury convicted Walton of first-degree murder under Arizona's alternate definitions of the crime, either premeditated murder or felony murder. As provided by Arizona law, the trial judge then conducted a sentencing hearing. The State proved two aggravating factors\u2014that the murder was committed in an \"especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner,\" and that it was committed for pecuniary gain. In mitigation, he argued his relative youth (he was 20) and his diminished capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. The trial judge found both aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, that the mitigating factors were not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency, and then imposed a death sentence.\n",

It was fought on October 8, 1901, within Arizona Territory's Fort Apache Indian Reservation, at a clearing in the forest known today as the \"Battleground\". Nine Arizona Rangers and deputies caught up with the cattle rustler Bill Smith and his gang. During a long exchange of gunfire that followed, Ranger Carlos Tafolla[3] and Deputy Bill Maxwell[4] were killed and one or two of the outlaws may have been wounded. In the end, the Smith Gang escaped the posse and fled into Mexico.[2]\nThe Arizona Rangers were established in 1901 and the Battleground Gunfight became the first major shootout to involve the new police force. The Smith Gang was one of the first targets for the rangers. In northeastern Graham County, Bill Smith owned a ranch on the Blue River, where he lived with his mother and his younger brothers and sisters. The ranch house served as a base for rustling cattle from nearby settlers, such as Henry Barrett, a former Rough Rider. In 1898, the Smith brothers were arrested for stealing unbranded calves from Barrett and Bill Phelps. Bill Smith assumed full responsibility, so he was sent to jail at St. Johns. Because of this, Bill was said to have developed a grudge against Henry Barrett. During the first week of October 1901, the Smith Gang was spotted at Pat Knoll, near Springerville, heading south with a herd of fifteen or twenty stolen horses. Police informants said the gang was on their way from Utah, where they robbed a train. A few days later, Bill and his brother Al came across Henry Barrett and another cowboy in the Big Cienega range. During the confrontation, Bill threatened to kill Barrett, so the latter informed the sheriff of Apache County, who organized a posse.[2]\nThe posse was led by the sheriff's deputy, Hank Sharp, and included Henry Barrett and two other locals named Pete Peterson and Elijah Holgate. Meanwhile, the Arizona Rangers Carlos Tafolla and Duane Hamblin were assigned to search for the Smith Gang. At Greer, the rangers and the posse met, and they decided to work together in tracking and capturing the outlaws. The rangers then deputized Barrett, Peterson and Holgate and they began following the outlaws' trail to the Little Colorado River, which they forded at a place known as Sheep's Crossing. From there the posse went to the ranch of Lorenzo Crosby to enlist his services and that of the brothers Arch and William Thomas \"Bill\" Maxwell,[4] both of whom were described as being excellent scouts. These three men were deputized as well, making the posse a force of nine men altogether. After that, the posse continued along the trail south to Big Lake and then to Dead Man's Crossing on the Black River. On October 7, at a ranch belonging to Pete Slaughter, the posse found an abandoned camp that was believed to have been recently occupied by the outlaws. The rangers decided to camp at the same location for the night and then proceed down the west side of the riverbank on the following morning.[2]\n",

He was arrested and charged with murder.[1] He was affiliated with Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, Ike Clanton, and Frank Stilwell during 1881\u20131882.

Modern writers have advanced various theories attributing his death to Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday, Frank Leslie, and Michael O'Rourke.\nJohnny Ringo, son of Martin and Mary Peters Ringo, had distant Dutch ancestry,[2] and was born in what later became the small town of Greens Fork, Clay Township, Wayne County, Indiana. His family moved to Liberty, Missouri in 1856. He was a tangentially related cousin to the Younger brothers through his aunt Augusta Peters Inskip, who married Coleman P. Younger, uncle of the outlaws.[3]\nIn 1858, his family moved from Liberty to Gallatin, where they rented property from the father of John W.

Among their most successful records were the original version of \"Funky Broadway\" (1966) and \"Let a Woman Be a Woman\" (1969).\nArlester Christian (June 13, 1943 \u2013 March 13, 1971), nicknamed \"Dyke\", was born (according to most sources) in Buffalo, New York.[1] He attended Burgard High School.[2] In 1960, he started playing bass in a Buffalo band, Carl LaRue and his Crew, who played local bars and clubs and released a single, \"Please Don't Drive Me Away\", on the KKC label in March 1962.[3][4][5] In 1964, LaRue was invited by Phoenix, Arizona-based disc jockey, Eddie O'Jay, to take his band to that city, to provide the backing for the vocal group that he managed there, The O'Jays. By 1965, however, the O'Jays and their manager had moved elsewhere, and LaRue's band fell apart. LaRue returned to Buffalo, but Christian and two other members of the band, guitarist Alvester \"Pig\" Jacobs and saxophonist J.V. Hunt, had no means of traveling and stayed in Phoenix.[4][1] They joined forces with an existing Phoenix group, The Three Blazers, who included tenor saxophonist Bernard Williams,[5] and, as \"Dyke and the Blazers\", added local musicians Rich Cason (organ) and Rodney Brown (drums).[6] Playing in local clubs, the group picked up on the rhythms, bass and organ innovations of James Brown's band, and through improvisation developed a riff-based song that became \"Funky Broadway\", the lyrics reflecting singer Dyke's memories of Broadway in Buffalo as well as Broadway Road in Phoenix.[4]\nIn summer 1966, the band were heard by Art Barrett, who became their manager and had them record the song at the Audio Recorders Studio in Phoenix. Barrett released the record on his own Artco label,[7][8] with Christian credited as its writer although other band members later claimed that they had contributed to the song. It became popular locally, and was reissued by Art Laboe's Original Sound label in Los Angeles.[4] The record steadily climbed the Billboard R&B chart early in 1967, reaching no. 17 in a 24-week stay on the chart, and also reached no. 65 on the pop chart.[9] The record was the first to use the word \"funky\" in its title, and for that reason was banned by some radio stations as offensive.[4] Its music was described by Rick James as \"revolutionary\", and Dyke developed a dance routine to go with it. The band added bass player Alvin Battle, freeing Dyke to concentrate on vocals, and toured widely on the back of its success. However, in the summer of 1967, the stresses of playing a series of engagements at the Apollo Theater in Harlem caused the band to split up, shortly before Wilson Pickett had a bigger hit with his own cover version of \"Funky Broadway\".[4] Pickett's recording reached no. 1 on the R&B chart and no. 8 on the pop chart.[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "Donald Eugene Harding (March 1, 1949 \u2013 April 6, 1992) was an American serial robber, serial killer, and spree killer who committed at least six murders between December 1979 and January 1980. Harding was executed in 1992 by the state of Arizona by gas chamber for two murders he committed there. Harding became the first person to be executed in Arizona since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated nationwide. His execution was particularly noteworthy and controversial due to the fact that his death in the gas chamber took eleven minutes and was reportedly gruesome. Harding's execution ultimately provided momentum for the movement to provide Arizona death row inmates with a choice between the gas chamber and lethal injection.\nHarding was born in his house in a small, rural Arkansas community called Goodrich, located within Augusta.[2] By the time a physician arrived to assist with the birth, Harding was struggling for air; this resulted in Harding incurring organic brain syndrome. He also suffered from neonatal jaundice.[3] Harding's father was an alcoholic who abandoned Harding, his older brother Darryl, and their mother Maycle. When Harding was a toddler, he was admitted to the Child Guidance Clinic in Little Rock, Arkansas, where a doctor treating him wrote in a report that his mother was \"very immature and narcissistic\" and unfit to care for her sons. When Harding's mother remarried to a man named Fred Brown who contracted tuberculosis, the family relocated to a sanatorium, where Harding alleged that nurses and staff regularly beat and mistreated him. One specific allegation involved a nurse dunking Harding's face in a toilet after he wet his bed.[3]\nThe family stayed at the sanatorium for approximately 2 years before leaving, after which Harding moved repeatedly between living with his mother and his grandparents. Ultimately, he settled with his mother in an impoverished area of North Little Rock. Harding witnessed Brown beating his mother; while he was in school, he struggled with behavioral issues, including defiance and truancy. A doctor reported in February 1960, shortly before Harding turned 11, that Harding displayed suicidal tendencies when he was 9 years old, slashing his wrists and leaving a suicide note in which he threatened to \"jump in a river.\" That same doctor noted that while Harding's brother Darryl displayed none of the problematic behaviors Harding did, Donald Harding had \"expressed the desire to kill and choke people. . . . It is amazing the degree of psychopathy contained in a boy of this young age.\" The doctor attributed Harding's behavioral issues to his brain damage, which his mother also claimed was exacerbated by Harding falling from a crib and being struck by a swing set during his childhood.[3] In his preteen and teenage years, Harding underwent three EEGs, the last one being in 1968. The tests confirmed that Harding suffered from organic brain damage and epileptic seizures.[4]\n",

Although it was thwarted by Jeff Milton, who managed to kill \"Three Fingered Jack\" Dunlop in an exchange of gunfire, the train robbery was unique for being one of the few to have occurred in a public place and was also one of the last during the Old West period.[1]\nIn the 1890s, Burt Alvord and his partner in crime, Billy Stiles, were serving as deputy sheriffs in Willcox. Law enforcement paid little, though, so they began robbing trains belonging to the Southern Pacific Railroad. For a while they managed to be successful and went undetected by their fellow lawmen.[1][2]\nAccording to James H. McClintock, train robbery was popular in Arizona at the time, which was exemplified by the passing of a statute in 1889 that made it punishable by death. However, the law was never enforced and several train robberies occurred between 1889 and 1899. One of the most daring, according to McClintock, was the Cochise Train Robbery. On September 9, 1899, Alvord's gang robbed a train as it was stopped at the town of Cochise. There they forced the staff off at gunpoint and then blew up the safe with dynamite. After taking several thousand dollars in gold coins and bills, the gang rode into the Chiricahua Mountains, unsuccessfully pursued by a posse under Sheriff Scott White and George Scarborough.[2][3]\n",

        "paragraph": "On August 25, 2014, 39-year-old Charles Vacca was accidentally shot and killed while instructing a nine-year-old girl in how to shoot a Mini-Uzi.[1] The accident occurred at the Arizona Last Stop Gun Range (also known as \"Bullets and Burgers\") in White Hills, Arizona, where Vacca had worked for about 18 months.[2] According to county law officials the shooting is being viewed as an industrial accident.[3]  The minimum age set by the shooting range to fire a weapon is eight years old provided that the child is supervised by a parent, as the girl was.[4] It was also legal for Arizona Last Stop to own the fully automatic Uzi because it was manufactured and purchased prior to the passage of the Firearm Owners Protection Act in 1986 and added to the National Firearms Act machine gun registry where all fully automatic civilian owned firearms are registered.[4]\nAccording to the girl's father, their family had traveled from their Las Vegas hotel to the Last Stop at approximately 9:45 AM. The family then took a ride on a monster truck before arriving at the gun range.[5] At the range, the girl's father was the first to shoot, followed by the girl herself. The girl's mother videotaped her daughter trying out the Uzi, and said she watched as the gun recoiled and her daughter lost control of it.[5] The girl reportedly said the Uzi was \"too much\" for her after she fired the weapon and was unable to control the muzzle rise, causing the barrel to be directed at Vacca.[6] Vacca is believed to have died from a single shot to the head. He was airlifted to the University Medical Center hospital in Las Vegas, where he died.[3][5][7]\nThe shooting ignited a discussion regarding whether children should be legally allowed to handle fully automatic weapons such as Uzis.[8] Mel Robbins, writing for CNN, argued that it should be against the law for such a young child to shoot an Uzi. She added that, in her view, the girl was not to blame for her instructor's death, but that the instructor and the girl's parents were at fault.[1] The owner of Last Stop, Sam Scarmardo, said it was considered pretty standard to allow children onto the range, and that he was reconsidering this policy in light of the accident.[9] Writing for National Review Online, Robert B. Young wrote that only one other incident had occurred in which a child killed someone with an automatic weapon, and therefore concluded that \"two incidents in six years do not make an epidemic, not even a trend.\" He also concluded that as gun ownership increased, the frequency of serious gun accidents involving children had decreased, attributing this to \"improved education for young people becoming acquainted with firearms\".[10]\n",

Andrew and Isabella divorced when Jimmie was twelve-years-old, after which he was raised by a family friend named Pete Kitchen. According to Jimmie's nephew, Art Mercer: \"Jimmie lived with Pete and his family until he was 14 or 15 years old.... Pete was quite a desperado. When some squaws tried to steal his horses, Jimmie killed two of the women.\"\nJimmie's first marriage was to Bessie Pearl McKinney, who was born in 1883, in Uvalde, Texas, and was the daughter of a well known and respected pioneer rancher. The two were married in Mammoth, Arizona, on July 16, 1898. Jimmie was popular and respected. He worked as a Pima County deputy sheriff and later a county ranger.

He then moved to Dallas, Texas where he entered a residency program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School's internal medicine department. A year later he switched to ophthalmology. While in Dallas, he met and began dating his neighbor, Daphne Herding,[5] whom he eventually married in a garden ceremony in 1997.[6] The couple moved to Indianapolis where Stidham undertook a fellowship in pediatric ophthalmology and adult strabismus at Indiana University.[5][6] In 1998, they returned to Texas when Stidham joined the faculty at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. Their first child, Alexandre Brian, was born in Houston in 2000.

New Jersey[1] to capital sentencing schemes, holding that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury to find the aggravating factors necessary for imposing the death penalty.[2] Ring overruled a portion of Walton v. Arizona,[3] which had rejected that contention.\nOn November 28, 1994, an armored car parked in front of Arrowhead Mall in Glendale, Arizona, was robbed. The driver, John Magoch, was shot in the head as he opened the door to smoke, and died almost instantly. One of the robbers then drove the van to a church in nearby Sun City, where they made off with $562,000 in cash and $271,000 in personal checks. An informant tipped the police off to Timothy Ring and two of his friends, who had recently made expensive purchases such as a new truck. Police eventually discovered that Ring was the ringleader of the operation. Ring was later charged with capital felony murder under Arizona law.\nThe jury eventually convicted Ring of felony murder, but Ring could not be sentenced to death without further findings, and Arizona law provided that the judge alone would make the findings. After a sentencing hearing, at which Ring's accomplices testified, the judge found that two aggravating factors applied: that Ring had committed the murder in expectation of pecuniary gain and that he had committed the murder in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner. Although he found that Ring had a \"minimal\" criminal record, the judge concluded that it did not outweigh the aggravating factors and sentenced Ring to death.\n",

As permitted by territory law,  he filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday on October 30.\nIn an unusual preliminary hearing, Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer heard testimony from a large number of witnesses during the next 30 days. Friends of the Cowboys, most notably Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, testified that the Cowboys had thrown up their hands or opened their coats and been shot in cold blood. Initially persuasive, his testimony motivated Spicer to jail Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday who had been free on bond. (Virgil and Morgan were recuperating from their wounds.) Friends of the lawman and several key neutral witnesses then testified that the Cowboys had drawn their guns and that Virgil Earp had called out, \"Hold, I don't want that!\" or words to that effect. In a lengthy ruling, Spicer concluded there was no basis for a trial. Although he criticized Virgil Earp's use of Wyatt and Holliday as deputies, he concluded that no laws were broken by the lawmen. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been properly deputized by Virgil. He described Frank McLaury's insistence that he would not give up his weapons unless the marshal and his deputies also gave up their arms as a \"proposition both monstrous and startling!\"\n",

In the case, the ICJ ruled that its own temporary court orders were legally binding and that the rights contained in the convention could not be denied by the application of domestic legal procedures.\nOn January 7, 1982, brothers Karl-Heinz LaGrand (1963\u20131999) and Walter Bernhard LaGrand (1962\u20131999) bungled an armed bank robbery in Marana, Arizona, United States, killing 63-year-old Kenneth Hartsock by stabbing him 24 times with a letter opener, and severely injuring 20-year-old Dawn Lopez by stabbing her multiple times. Lopez later said she heard one of the brothers twice say, \"Just make sure he's dead.\"[1] They were subsequently charged and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The LaGrands also had prior convictions for robbery and burglary, which were used against them during the sentencing phase of their trials.[2][3][4]\nThe LaGrands were German nationals, having been born from a German mother in Germany. While they had both lived in the United States since they were four and five, respectively, neither had obtained U.S. citizenship. As foreigners, the LaGrands should have been informed of their right to consular assistance, under the Vienna Convention, from their state of nationality, Germany. However, the Arizona authorities failed to do this. The brothers later contacted Consul William Behrens, head of the German Consulate in Phoenix, on their own accord, having learned of their right to consular assistance. They appealed their sentences and convictions on the grounds that they were not informed of their right to consular assistance, and that with consular assistance they might have been able to mount a better defense. The federal courts rejected their argument on grounds of procedural default, which provides that issues cannot be raised in federal court appeals unless they have first been raised in state courts.\n",

Four men were killed during the shootout, including three lawmen and Jeff Power, the owner of the cabin. The Power brothers, Tom and John, then escaped to Mexico with a man named Tom Sisson, but they were eventually caught after what was then the largest manhunt in the history of Arizona.[1][2]\nThe Power family composed of \"Old Man\" Jeff, the father, his wife, Martha, three sons; Charles, John, and Tom, and one daughter; Ola May. They were originally from Texas, but moved to Arizona Territory in 1909 and homesteaded in lower Rattlesnake Canyon, south of Klondyke. Two years later, Charles bought a nearby goat ranch, which is now known as Power's Garden, and the family moved there. After improving the ranch by adding more rooms to the cabin, the Powers began importing cattle. Life was not easy though; the Powers family lived \"in what was still a rough and occasionally violent frontier,\" so the brothers often had to find work at the neighboring ranches or mines.[1][3]\nIn 1915, Martha Power was killed in a horse and buggy accident and by 1917 the cattle ranch had been sold and Charles had moved away to New Mexico. Later that year, Jeff Power purchased Perry Tucker's one-quarter interest in the Abandoned Claims, an old gold mine in nearby Keilberg Canyon, which is now known as Power's Mine. Hard workers, the Power family and a friend named Tom Sisson built a twenty-five mile wagon road \"through some of the roughest country imaginable\" to their mine. The road ran from the Haby Ranch, several miles north of Klondyke on Aravaipa Creek, south for about twelve miles before dropping down Power's Hill into Rattlesnake Canyon, then up the canyon to the Abandoned Claims at Keilberg Canyon. Sisson and the Powers\nbuilt a cabin to live in and, when they were in control of three-quarters of the property, they purchased a second-hand stamp mill.[1][3][4]\n",

Detective Gary Dhaemers responded, and a few hours later a command center was set up.\nNot long after Hoskinson's abduction was publicized, a tipster reported seeing a young girl matching the victim's description in a store, accompanied by an adult woman.

However, the mineral rights were claimed by the government and Wickenburg immigrated to the United States in 1847, after the local authorities raided the family farm.[2]\nWickenburg arrived at the Port of New York in 1847. Upon learning of the discovery of gold in California, in what is known as the California gold rush, he decided to go to San Francisco. He arrived in San Francisco in 1853 and learned how to prospect and pan for gold. In accordance to his Declaration of Intention in 1877, he became a naturalized American citizen that same year.

The escape resulted in the deaths of two sheriffs and triggered one of the largest manhunts in Arizona history. Veterans of the Apache Wars scoured the Arizona frontier for nearly a year in search of the fugitives, by the end of which all were caught or killed except for the famous Indian scout known as the Apache Kid.\nWhen the reservation system began in Arizona, the local Apache peoples were among the first to be subjugated. Throughout most of the Old West period, the reservations were undersupplied, which led to starvation, and their operators tended to be corrupt. This led to conflicts such as Geronimo's War, beginning in 1881, during which Geronimo and his band of Apaches left their assigned reservations and evaded capture until 1886. The Apache Kid, or Haskay-bay-nay-ntayl, had for most of the 1880s served as an Indian scout for the U.S. Army in the Apache Wars, having been involved in the mutiny during the Battle of Cibecue Creek and the Crawford Affair. Though many people at the time believed that the Apache Kid did not kill any of the soldiers at Cibecue, he left the reservation system in 1887 after an incident at the San Carlos Reservation. The Kid was also a friend of Al Sieber, Chief of the Army Scouts, who allegedly betrayed him after the Cibecue affair. Sometime in 1888 the Apache Kid was caught, put on trial in Globe for various crimes, and sentenced to spend the next seven years in Yuma Territorial Prison. The Kid had already served over a year of prison time at San Carlos and Alcatraz Island, so the prospect of going to the prison at Yuma was intolerable and he conspired with his fellow inmates to escape whenever and wherever possible.\nAfter the trial, on the morning of November 1, 1889, Sheriff Glenn Reynolds arrived at the jail in Safford to pick up eight Apache prisoners and one Mexican who were to be transferred to Casa Grande by stagecoach, a two-day ride, and from there to Yuma by train. Sheriff Reynolds made arrangements to be taken to Casa Grande by stagecoach owner Eugene Middleton, who had survived several conflicts with the Apaches since 1881. Reynolds also collected $400 from the county clerk to pay the expenses of the trip. Accompanying Reynolds and Middleton was Sheriff William A. \"Hunkydory\" Holmes. When the prisoners were loaded into the coach the party headed north for Globe. Sheriff Reynolds rode his horse, Tex, while Middleton and Holmes rode in the coach. The trip was long; Holmes spent the time target-shooting with his rifle, while Middleton sang and drank whiskey. After stopping at Pioneer, Arizona for lunch, the party continued on to the Gila River in a rainstorm. Just beyond the Gila was the little town of Kelvin, or Riverside Station, where the party stopped for the night.\n",

Arizona.[3]\nIn early January 1974, Greenawalt went on a trip down to Miami, Florida, where he planned to exchange his car with a couple from Denver, Colorado.[4] On January 12, the body of 42-year-old Henry A. Weber, a Global Van Lines truck driver who had been shot in the head, was found at a highway rest area in Mississippi County, Arkansas.[4] Initially, nobody could be connected to the crime until four days later, when police officers in Tempe, Arizona detained brothers Randy and James Greenawalt, 25 and 23, respectively, for the January 15 murder of 33-year-old Stanley Edward Sandage at a rest area near Flagstaff.[5] Like Weber, Sandage was a truck driver working for Whitfield Tank Lines who was found shot to death in his tank truck in an apparent robbery, as $42 had been stolen from his wallet.[6]\nThe Greenawalts were arrested for trying to purchase stereo equipment using Sandage's MasterCharge card, and upon inspecting their vehicle, they found a .32-caliber pistol that was positively identified as the murder weapon, and a .243-caliber rifle that might have been the second murder weapon.[5] A third man, 33-year-old George Sanders, an apparent acquaintance of the brothers, was also arrested for federal firearms violations and credit card fraud in relation to the case.[5] Due to the similarity of the two cases, a sheriff from Arkansas was dispatched to question Randy in the earlier killing, but decided to wait until the case in Arizona went first.[4] In a bid to avoid the death penalty, the elder Greenawalt pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment, in exchange for testifying against his brother, who had pleaded innocent on all charges.[7] During the trial, it was made apparent that in the Sandage murder, Randy had pre-emptively painted an \"X\" on the window of the truck before proceeding to open fire and kill his victim.[8] Thanks to his testimony, James was also convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he was to spend at the Florence State Prison.[9] In the meantime, Randy  was extradited to face charges in Arkansas, but despite his willing confession to both this and another murder committed in Colorado, the case fell through and he was returned to serve his sentence in Arizona.[8]\n",

In July 1879, several rustlers attacked a rancho in northern Sonora, killing several of the inhabitants. After the attack on the rancho, the survivors reported the attacks to Commandant Francisco Neri, who sent out a detachment of Rurales, including Captain Alfredo Carrillo. The Rurales  crossed the border into Arizona. As they entered Skeleton Canyon, shots were fired against them. Of the large group that crossed, only three of the Rurales survived.\nNo action was taken by the Mexican Government, but it protested the killings to President Chester Arthur, although acknowledging the Mexican policemen had crossed  into Arizona. Johnny Ringo, considered to be one of an outlaw group known as the Cochise County Cowboys, who were cattle rustlers and bandits, claimed to have been at the ambush.

They were originally from Texas, but moved to Arizona Territory in 1909 and homesteaded in lower Rattlesnake Canyon, south of Klondyke. Two years later, Charles bought a nearby goat ranch, which is now known as Power's Garden, and the family moved there. After improving the ranch by adding more rooms to the cabin, the Powers began importing cattle. Life was not easy though; the Powers family lived \"in what was still a rough and occasionally violent frontier,\" so the brothers often had to find work at the neighboring ranches or mines.[1][3]\nIn 1915, Martha Power was killed in a horse and buggy accident and by 1917 the cattle ranch had been sold and Charles had moved away to New Mexico. Later that year, Jeff Power purchased Perry Tucker's one-quarter interest in the Abandoned Claims, an old gold mine in nearby Keilberg Canyon, which is now known as Power's Mine. Hard workers, the Power family and a friend named Tom Sisson built a twenty-five mile wagon road \"through some of the roughest country imaginable\" to their mine. The road ran from the Haby Ranch, several miles north of Klondyke on Aravaipa Creek, south for about twelve miles before dropping down Power's Hill into Rattlesnake Canyon, then up the canyon to the Abandoned Claims at Keilberg Canyon. Sisson and the Powers\nbuilt a cabin to live in and, when they were in control of three-quarters of the property, they purchased a second-hand stamp mill.[1][3][4]\n",

La Paz was one of a handful of mining settlements that had been established along the Colorado River. It was situated along an important army supply route that had been in use since the Yuma War. The army used the Colorado River to supply garrisons in Arizona. On the evening of May 20, 1863, the Colorado River steamer Cocopah arrived at La Paz en route to Fort Mohave.

At the second trial, with his confession excluded from evidence, he was convicted. He was sentenced to 20\u201330 years in prison.\nErnesto Arturo Miranda was born in Mesa, Arizona on March 9, 1941. Miranda began getting in trouble when he was in grade school. Shortly after his mother died his father remarried. Miranda and his father didn't get along very well; he kept his distance from his brothers and stepmother as well. Miranda's first criminal conviction was during his eighth-grade year. The following year, he was convicted of burglary and sentenced to a year in reform school.\n",

The town was originally a stagecoach stop known as Antelope Station, and was later renamed \"Stanton\" after the businessman and crook Chuck Stanton, who took over the town in the 1870s. Stanton is located approximately twenty miles north of Wickenburg, at the base of Rich Hill, near the ghost towns of Octave and Weaver.[2][3][4]\nThe town of Stanton, like the towns of Octave and Weaver, owe their existence to a group of pioneers who discovered gold in the area in 1863. Led by the frontiersman Pauline Weaver, the explorers were camped along Antelope Creek when one of the men \u2013 a tracker named Alvaro \u2013 decided to go chasing after a runaway burro. After climbing to the top of what would become known as Rich Hill, Alvaro tripped over a pile of gold nuggets that were \"as big as potatoes.\" Soon after, Pauline Weaver and a friend named Jack Swilling found another pile of gold on top of nearby Antelope Hill. Weaver said that gold was so plentiful in the area that he could pop nuggets out of the ground with a knife, and that one acre yielded nearly $500,000 in gold.[2][5][6]\nThe 1863 strike transformed Antelope Station into a boomtown overnight. Originally just a small stage stop, by 1868 Antelope Station supported a population of 3,500 people. Chuck Stanton first arrived in town a few years later. He wasted no time in recruiting the help of some Mexican bandits so he could wipe out his competition and take control of the town. His first two victims were his neighbors, George \"Yaqui\" Wilson and William Partridge, both of whom owned a store and a stage stop. In August 1877, Stanton tricked Partridge into killing Wilson over some pigs, and so Partridge was arrested and sent to the Yuma Territorial Prison.[2]\n",

Tracy in the town of Benson, Arizona. Tracy resisted arrest and opened fire on Wheeler, but the latter armed himself and a gunfight ensued. When the shooting was over, both Tracy and Wheeler were badly wounded, however, the former died of his wounds and Wheeler fully recovered.[1][2]\nJ. A. Tracy was a wealthy businessman who lived in Vail Station, where he was employed as an agent for the Helvetia Copper Company. According to author Pleasant DeSpain, Tracy came to Arizona from Nevada to pursue a young lady, with whom he'd had relations in the past. The lady was not interested in Tracy though and she left Nevada for Phoenix between 1905 and 1906. There she joined a Mr. D. W. Silverton, Jr., who was the son of the Kentucky Colonel D. W. Silverton, and the two went to Tucson to settle down. Mr. Silverton claimed that he married the young lady, whose name remains unknown, because she refused to tell the newspapers in the aftermath of the Benson shooting. She was the daughter in a wealthy family from Colorado and, because of her relationship with Tracy, she wanted to protect her family name from embarrassment. The ceremony was, allegedly, carried out by a traveling evangelist minister in Phoenix, but a later investigation suggested that the marriage may have been fabricated. Tracy was not giving up on Mrs. Silverton. He began sending her threatening letters and, sometime later, he purchased a diamond ring with the intention of proposing to her, unaware that she had already been married.[1][2][3]\nIn February 1907, when they discovered that Tracy was coming to Tucson \"to set things right,\" the Silvertons decided it would be best to be somewhere else. Accordingly, they boarded a train for Bisbee on the afternoon of February 26. Along the way they stopped at Vail Station and it was at this time that they saw Tracy standing outside on the platform. Mr. Silverton stepped off the train to confront Tracy, but it is unknown what exactly was said in the following argument. When the train began moving again, Silverton boarded it and saw Tracy attempt to jump on the caboose. The journey continued on towards Bisbee, however, the train had to stop overnight in the small town of Benson and the Silvertons were forced to book a room at the Virginia Hotel, located across the street from the station. Fearing that Tracy was following behind, Mr. Silverton hired a local man to watch the train station and warn him if the former arrived.[1][2][3]\n",

Lohwasser's account of Gray's death sparked controversy, because of the suffering that Gray exhibited. At the time of Gray's execution, the gas chamber used in Mississippi had a vertical steel pole directly behind the inmate's chair. There was no headrest or strap used to restrain Gray's head.

A brief gunfight ensued, during which Constable Chester L. Ainsworth was killed and his deputy, Teddy Moore, was mortally wounded. The Halderman brothers then fled to New Mexico, but they were captured shortly thereafter and executed on November 16, 1900, following a hasty trial in Tombstone.[1][2][3][4]\nWilliam and Thomas Halderman were twenty-one and eighteen, respectively, at the time of their deaths. They belonged to a wealthy and influential family of Texas pioneers, the Kokernots, but worked as cowboys in Cochise County, Arizona. In 1898, the Halderman brothers began feuding with the eighteen-year-old Teddy Moore over a pair of young women named Rena and Mary Wilson. According to later court findings, in November 1898, Moore threatened to kill William and continued to do so over the following months. Finally, on April 6, 1899, Justice William Monmonier received a report from the owner of the Smith Ranch, Buck Smith, accusing the Halderman brothers of stealing and killing cattle. A warrant was issued and the task of arresting the Haldermans fell onto Constable Chester Ainsworth, who was the brother of Attorney General Charles F. Ainsworth.[1][2][3][4]\nBecause the Chiricahua Mountains were both wild and remote in 1899, Constable Ainsworth first went from his office in Pearce to the Smith Ranch to ask one of the ranchers there if he would assist in apprehending the Haldermans. However, according to R. Michael Wilson, Mr. Smith refused to help and told the constable to continue on to the Moore Ranch house, less than a mile away, to enlist the help of Teddy Moore. Ainsworth did just that and after deputizing Moore the two-man posse headed to the Halderman Ranch, which was located a short distance away, along Turkey Creek Canyon. After finding the house empty, Ainsworth decided to check Wilson Ranch, which was owned by John W. Wilson, who lived there with his sons, Johnny and Tol, and his two daughters, Rena and Mary.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n",

Presently, little of the cabin remains except for some foundations and small portions of the walls.[1] A few unmarked graves have been identified, but because of theft, vandalism, and erosion, the site has been heavily damaged.[2]\nFrederick Brunckow was born in Germany in 1830. After attending the University of Westphalia to become a mining engineer, Brunckow emigrated to the United States in 1850 and joined the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company, which eventually took him west.[3]\nIn 1858, Brunckow left the Sonora Company to develop his own San Pedro Silver Mine, which was located approximately eight miles southwest of what would become Tombstone, near the San Pedro River. Joining him were a chemist named John Moss, or Morse, a German cook named David Brontrager, and two miners named James and William M. Williams. Relying mainly on Mexican labor, Brunckow built a store for supplies and a cabin to be used as a sleeping quarters. A small and simple structure, the cabin was made of adobe and had a tin roof and a fireplace.[2][3]\n",

Wheeler, and his deputy, Lafe Gibson, were ambushed by a gang of Mexican alcohol smugglers near the town of Gleeson, Arizona.

Arizona became a \"dry\" state with the banning of  alcohol on January 1, 1915. But because Cochise County was bordered by \"wet\" Mexico and New Mexico, it quickly became a conduit for both American and Mexican alcohol smugglers.[1][4]\nHarry Wheeler, a former Captain of the Arizona Rangers and the Sheriff of Cochise County was an enthusiastic enforcer of the state's ban on the sale and manufacture of liquor. Throughout his tenure in office, Wheeler and his deputies arrested dozens of violators and routinely patrolled the border with New Mexico and the International Boundary with Mexico for smugglers.

On the night before, two men named William Evans and John Shaw robbed a saloon in Winslow and made off with at least $200 in coins. Two lawmen pursued the bandits and on the following day they encountered each other in Canyon Diablo. A three-second shootout ensued, which was described at the time as \"one huge explosion\" that resulted in the death of Shaw and the wounding and capture of Evans.[1][2][3]\nLittle is known about the lives of William Evans and John Shaw before they became bandits. The former was an ex-convict who also went by the name of William Smith, or Smythe. Both were in their early to mid twenties when they decided that banditry would be easier than being a cowboy. The robbery which ultimately led to the shooting in Canyon Diablo occurred on the night of April 7, 1905. Shortly before midnight, Evans and Shaw entered the Wigwam Saloon in Winslow, Arizona, dressed in their finest clothing. The two headed straight for the bar and ordered a couple shots of rot gut, a type of whiskey common at the time. They weren't interested in wasting time, though, and before drinking they turned around and pulled out their revolvers to hold up a group of seven men playing poker at one of the tables. At gunpoint, the two bandits relieved the gamblers of between $200 and $600 worth of silver coins and then fled out the front door without firing a shot.[1][2][4]\nPete Pemberton, the deputy sheriff of Navajo County, and owner of the saloon, was immediately notified and after examining the crime scene he informed his superior, Sheriff Chet Houck, who was the younger brother of Jim Houck. Shortly before, Pemberton and the city marshal, Bob Giles, found a trail of silver coins along the railroad tracks leading to Flagstaff so it was assumed that the bandits had jumped on board a moving train and that the coins must have fallen out of their pockets. From Holbrook, Sheriff Houck boarded a train to Flagstaff, where he met up with Pemberton and started an investigation. After finding neither the bandits or any relevant information, they reboarded the train for Winslow. However, on the ride back the lawmen just happened to receive word that two suspicious-looking men had been seen hiding in the bushes along the railroad tracks, near the turn to Canyon Diablo.[1][2][4]\n",

Whether he had just three fingers on one of his hands is not confirmed.\nDunlop was born in Texas and spent most of his mid to late teens as a cowboy. Where he became an outlaw is unknown, but he was arrested after several bank robberies in 1893. Released from prison in 1895, Dunlop joined the \"Black Jack\" Christian Gang, but by 1898 he was riding with Burt Alvord's Gang, along with George and Louis Owens, Billy Stiles, Bravo Juan Yoas, and Bob Brown. The gang began robbing trains in Arizona, and \"Three Fingered Jack\" Dunlop quickly became the best known. At midnight on September 9, 1899, the gang robbed a Southern Pacific Express of just over $10,000. The gang had detached the car containing the money, then opened the safe with dynamite. They escaped into the Chiricahua Mountains, where they eluded a posse led by Sheriff Scott White and including George Scarborough.\nA few months later, they struck again. On February 15, 1900, the gang robbed a train at the Fairbank, which served Tombstone, Arizona. However, well known lawman Jeff Davis Milton was working as a guard on the train. A gunfight began, resulting in Milton shooting buckshot into Dunlop, and wounding gang member Juan Yoas. Milton was badly wounded in the right arm, but the gang fled anyway.\n",

In Bisbee, immigrant workers organized and were violently rounded up and transported to the desert in New Mexico; not as famous as the events in nearby Tombstone, the deportation didn't live in the national memory, but is quietly remembered by the townsfolk today. And so at the 100 year anniversary, Bisbee citizens organized a re-enactment. The events unfold again, as if they were happening in 1917, framed alongside interviews with the present day locals.[3]\nMultiple producers are listed for the film, they are, alphabetically: Susan Bedusa, Dan Cogan, Geralyn White Dreyfous, Bennett Elliott, Davis Guggenheim, Laurene Powell Jobs, Jenny Raskin, Jonathan Silberberg, Nicole Stott, Douglas Tirola, Scott Woelfel, and Stacey Woelfel.[4]\n",

Ryder's soft pastels colored paintings captured the dusty brooding southwestern twilight skies.\nHe was born on his father's ranch in Continental, Arizona on July 7, 1899.[1]  Van Ryder spent his younger days as a cowboy.  He ran away from home at the age of 13 for the logging camps of Oregon and the Salmon fishing along the Tillamock and Trask Rivers.  He then showed up in Montana, where he was a wrangler for four years. He served in the 4th and 17th U.S. Cavalry, and in the 38th US Infantry from 1917 to 1921. Then he returned to the West, roaming cow country from the Canada\u2013US border to Mexico, from Colorado to California.[2]  He called himself \"The Rambling Kid.\"\nIn 1924, he headed to Hollywood to work as an extra in a Hoot Gibson western.  In 1926, he was offered an art job at the Mark Sennet Studios, working on a giant relief map of California that was installed in San Francisco's Ferry Building.[3]\n",

Gary Tison was serving a life sentence at the Arizona State Prison in Florence for killing a prison guard. His three sons, Donald, Ricky, and Raymond, plotted to break him and his cellmate, Randy Greenawalt, out of prison.

Greenawalt helped in the escape by cutting off telephones and alarm systems.[2]\nThey escaped in Donald Tison's 1969 Lincoln Continental, but the next day, one of the Lincoln's tires blew out on a stretch of road not far from the California border, near Quartzsite.

The family then took a ride on a monster truck before arriving at the gun range.[5] At the range, the girl's father was the first to shoot, followed by the girl herself. The girl's mother videotaped her daughter trying out the Uzi, and said she watched as the gun recoiled and her daughter lost control of it.[5] The girl reportedly said the Uzi was \"too much\" for her after she fired the weapon and was unable to control the muzzle rise, causing the barrel to be directed at Vacca.[6] Vacca is believed to have died from a single shot to the head. He was airlifted to the University Medical Center hospital in Las Vegas, where he died.[3][5][7]\nThe shooting ignited a discussion regarding whether children should be legally allowed to handle fully automatic weapons such as Uzis.[8] Mel Robbins, writing for CNN, argued that it should be against the law for such a young child to shoot an Uzi. She added that, in her view, the girl was not to blame for her instructor's death, but that the instructor and the girl's parents were at fault.[1] The owner of Last Stop, Sam Scarmardo, said it was considered pretty standard to allow children onto the range, and that he was reconsidering this policy in light of the accident.[9] Writing for National Review Online, Robert B. Young wrote that only one other incident had occurred in which a child killed someone with an automatic weapon, and therefore concluded that \"two incidents in six years do not make an epidemic, not even a trend.\" He also concluded that as gun ownership increased, the frequency of serious gun accidents involving children had decreased, attributing this to \"improved education for young people becoming acquainted with firearms\".[10]\n",

She was one of three people sentenced to death for the December 2, 1989 shooting death of her four-year-old son, Christopher Conan Milke.  Her alleged conspirators were her roommate James Lynn Styers and his friend Roger Mark Scott.  Neither testified against her and both agreed that she was not present at the shooting.  Scott implicated Milke as the mastermind while Styers said she had no involvement whatsoever.  They implicated each other as the actual shooter.[1]  Who that was remains a subject of speculation.\nWith the passage of time Milke's conviction became increasingly polarizing, largely due to the conduct and testimony of Phoenix police detective Armando Saldate Jr.  Saldate testified that Milke confessed to him.  The alleged confession was uncorroborated, however, and Milke is adamant it did not occur.[2]  Saldate was later accused of perjury.[3]  Questions about whether a confession was made and whether Milke had voluntarily waived her Miranda rights,[4] Saldate's long history of misconduct,[5] and prosecuting attorney Noel Levy withholding Saldate's personnel record from the defense, became central issues of Milke's appeals.[6]\nIn March, 2013, a three-judge panel of the United States Ninth Circuit Court unanimously overturned Debra Milke's conviction.  In their ruling, the judges excoriated the conviction.[7][8]  Milke was released on $250,000 bond that September by Judge Rosa P. Mroz of the Maricopa County Superior Court.[9]  County prosecutor Bill Montgomery unsuccessfully appealed the decision to the state supreme court,[10] which blocked a proposed retrial.[11]  On March 23, 2015, all charges against Debra Milke were formally dismissed with prejudice by Judge Mroz.[12]\n",

His childhood was somewhat troubled, as his father was an alcoholic who frequently changed jobs and belittled him and his siblings during his drunken stupors.[2] Walden claimed that at some point in his youth he was also sexually abused, but this has never been conclusively verified. However, aside from these issues, the Waldens were considered a respectable family, with the parents encouraging Robert to do well in school, and in particular, sports. Walden claimed that while he was in college, he was on the student council, studied German and was supposedly offered a baseball scholarship, but had to turn it down due to a knee injury.[2]\nAfter graduating college, Walden joined the United States Air Force in 1985, where he was noted for his heavy drinking, and the following year, he was discharged for writing bad checks.[2] Soon after, Walden moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he met 16-year-old single mother Catherine \"Cathy\" Mills, who eventually married him against her mother's wishes. Not long after, he began to physically and verbally abuse his wife, even beating her while she was pregnant with their first child. Reportedly, Walden forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will, which made her feel humiliated.[3]\n",

The first incident occurred in February 1920 when Mexican bandits robbed and killed the two owners of the Ruby Mercantile. A second attack happened in April 1921 when Mexican bandits robbed and killed the store's new owners. Two of the bandits were arrested for the crime, but they briefly escaped custody in July 1922 after killing another two men, which led to the largest manhunt in the history of the Southwest.[1][2]\nThe mining town of Ruby was established in Bear Valley during the 1870s and was a haven for cattle rustlers and other criminals for most of its Old West history. Ruby was very small and its one general store was the sole business other than mining. The store was called the Ruby Mercantile, built sometime in the late 1880s, and it also served as the post office when it opened in 1912. In 1914, the mercantile was purchased by Philip C. Clarke, who later built a larger store a short distance from the original. The second building was an adobe structure, the remains of which have been preserved.[2]\nThe Mexican Revolution erupted in 1910, and the town's proximity to the international border meant that it was harassed by bandits and rebels on many occasions. Rebels loyal to Pancho Villa were active throughout the Mexican territory opposite the Arizona border. The area was one of the hardest hit during the civil war, which fueled the lawlessness. By 1920, the town was declining, but it was still considered quite dangerous; the inhabitants were instructed to be heavily armed at all times. Clarke felt that the area was so dangerous that he kept either a pistol or a rifle in each room of his house and the store.[2]\n",

While they had both lived in the United States since they were four and five, respectively, neither had obtained U.S. citizenship. As foreigners, the LaGrands should have been informed of their right to consular assistance, under the Vienna Convention, from their state of nationality, Germany. However, the Arizona authorities failed to do this. The brothers later contacted Consul William Behrens, head of the German Consulate in Phoenix, on their own accord, having learned of their right to consular assistance. They appealed their sentences and convictions on the grounds that they were not informed of their right to consular assistance, and that with consular assistance they might have been able to mount a better defense. The federal courts rejected their argument on grounds of procedural default, which provides that issues cannot be raised in federal court appeals unless they have first been raised in state courts.\n",

Forde and Bush were sentenced to death, while Gaxiola was sentenced to life in prison without parole.\nShawna Forde and her accomplices gained entry into the Flores home by claiming they were officials looking for fugitives. The suspects had the expectation of finding money and drugs that could be sold to finance Forde's vigilante nativist group, Minutemen American Defense (MAD), which patrolled Arizona's border with Mexico. When they found no drugs, the intruders took inexpensive jewelry and fatally shot 29-year-old Raul Flores Jr. and his daughter, nine-year-old Brisenia Ylianna Flores.[1]\n",

When he was taken prisoner he enthusiastically cooperated with his captors, likely since his father had been sent to a Nazi concentration camp as a political prisoner.[2]\nEventually, United States Navy intelligence officers recruited Drechsler as a spy and placed him in a prisoner of war (POW) camp near Fort Meade, Maryland with other U-boat sailors.

Four men were killed during the shootout, including three lawmen and Jeff Power, the owner of the cabin. The Power brothers, Tom and John, then escaped to Mexico with a man named Tom Sisson, but they were eventually caught after what was then the largest manhunt in the history of Arizona.[1][2]\nThe Power family composed of \"Old Man\" Jeff, the father, his wife, Martha, three sons; Charles, John, and Tom, and one daughter; Ola May. They were originally from Texas, but moved to Arizona Territory in 1909 and homesteaded in lower Rattlesnake Canyon, south of Klondyke. Two years later, Charles bought a nearby goat ranch, which is now known as Power's Garden, and the family moved there. After improving the ranch by adding more rooms to the cabin, the Powers began importing cattle. Life was not easy though; the Powers family lived \"in what was still a rough and occasionally violent frontier,\" so the brothers often had to find work at the neighboring ranches or mines.[1][3]\nIn 1915, Martha Power was killed in a horse and buggy accident and by 1917 the cattle ranch had been sold and Charles had moved away to New Mexico. Later that year, Jeff Power purchased Perry Tucker's one-quarter interest in the Abandoned Claims, an old gold mine in nearby Keilberg Canyon, which is now known as Power's Mine. Hard workers, the Power family and a friend named Tom Sisson built a twenty-five mile wagon road \"through some of the roughest country imaginable\" to their mine. The road ran from the Haby Ranch, several miles north of Klondyke on Aravaipa Creek, south for about twelve miles before dropping down Power's Hill into Rattlesnake Canyon, then up the canyon to the Abandoned Claims at Keilberg Canyon. Sisson and the Powers\nbuilt a cabin to live in and, when they were in control of three-quarters of the property, they purchased a second-hand stamp mill.[1][3][4]\n",

Just as in Enmund, in Tison the Court applied the proportionality principle to conclude that the death penalty was an appropriate punishment for a felony murderer who was a major participant in the underlying felony and exhibited a reckless indifference to human life.\n\nThis case stems from an infamous prison break during the summer of 1978. Gary Tison was serving a life sentence at the Arizona State Prison in Florence for killing a prison guard. His three sons, Donald, Ricky, and Raymond, plotted to break him and his cellmate, Randy Greenawalt, out of prison. On July 30, 1978, the sons entered the prison for a visit, taking advantage of a policy that allowed an informal picnic setting for weekend family visits, carrying an ice chest packed with revolvers and sawed-off shotguns.[1] One of them aimed a sawed-off shotgun at a lobby guard. Greenawalt helped in the escape by cutting off telephones and alarm systems.[2]\nThey escaped in Donald Tison's 1969 Lincoln Continental, but the next day, one of the Lincoln's tires blew out on a stretch of road not far from the California border, near Quartzsite. Marine Sgt. John Lyons, 24, of Yuma, traveling with his wife, son, and niece on his way to visit family in Nebraska, stopped to help.\n",

It was fought on October 8, 1901, within Arizona Territory's Fort Apache Indian Reservation, at a clearing in the forest known today as the \"Battleground\". Nine Arizona Rangers and deputies caught up with the cattle rustler Bill Smith and his gang. During a long exchange of gunfire that followed, Ranger Carlos Tafolla[3] and Deputy Bill Maxwell[4] were killed and one or two of the outlaws may have been wounded. In the end, the Smith Gang escaped the posse and fled into Mexico.[2]\nThe Arizona Rangers were established in 1901 and the Battleground Gunfight became the first major shootout to involve the new police force. The Smith Gang was one of the first targets for the rangers. In northeastern Graham County, Bill Smith owned a ranch on the Blue River, where he lived with his mother and his younger brothers and sisters. The ranch house served as a base for rustling cattle from nearby settlers, such as Henry Barrett, a former Rough Rider. In 1898, the Smith brothers were arrested for stealing unbranded calves from Barrett and Bill Phelps. Bill Smith assumed full responsibility, so he was sent to jail at St. Johns. Because of this, Bill was said to have developed a grudge against Henry Barrett. During the first week of October 1901, the Smith Gang was spotted at Pat Knoll, near Springerville, heading south with a herd of fifteen or twenty stolen horses. Police informants said the gang was on their way from Utah, where they robbed a train. A few days later, Bill and his brother Al came across Henry Barrett and another cowboy in the Big Cienega range. During the confrontation, Bill threatened to kill Barrett, so the latter informed the sheriff of Apache County, who organized a posse.[2]\nThe posse was led by the sheriff's deputy, Hank Sharp, and included Henry Barrett and two other locals named Pete Peterson and Elijah Holgate. Meanwhile, the Arizona Rangers Carlos Tafolla and Duane Hamblin were assigned to search for the Smith Gang. At Greer, the rangers and the posse met, and they decided to work together in tracking and capturing the outlaws. The rangers then deputized Barrett, Peterson and Holgate and they began following the outlaws' trail to the Little Colorado River, which they forded at a place known as Sheep's Crossing. From there the posse went to the ranch of Lorenzo Crosby to enlist his services and that of the brothers Arch and William Thomas \"Bill\" Maxwell,[4] both of whom were described as being excellent scouts. These three men were deputized as well, making the posse a force of nine men altogether. After that, the posse continued along the trail south to Big Lake and then to Dead Man's Crossing on the Black River. On October 7, at a ranch belonging to Pete Slaughter, the posse found an abandoned camp that was believed to have been recently occupied by the outlaws. The rangers decided to camp at the same location for the night and then proceed down the west side of the riverbank on the following morning.[2]\n",

In the case, the ICJ ruled that its own temporary court orders were legally binding and that the rights contained in the convention could not be denied by the application of domestic legal procedures.\nOn January 7, 1982, brothers Karl-Heinz LaGrand (1963\u20131999) and Walter Bernhard LaGrand (1962\u20131999) bungled an armed bank robbery in Marana, Arizona, United States, killing 63-year-old Kenneth Hartsock by stabbing him 24 times with a letter opener, and severely injuring 20-year-old Dawn Lopez by stabbing her multiple times. Lopez later said she heard one of the brothers twice say, \"Just make sure he's dead.\"[1] They were subsequently charged and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The LaGrands also had prior convictions for robbery and burglary, which were used against them during the sentencing phase of their trials.[2][3][4]\nThe LaGrands were German nationals, having been born from a German mother in Germany. While they had both lived in the United States since they were four and five, respectively, neither had obtained U.S. citizenship. As foreigners, the LaGrands should have been informed of their right to consular assistance, under the Vienna Convention, from their state of nationality, Germany. However, the Arizona authorities failed to do this. The brothers later contacted Consul William Behrens, head of the German Consulate in Phoenix, on their own accord, having learned of their right to consular assistance. They appealed their sentences and convictions on the grounds that they were not informed of their right to consular assistance, and that with consular assistance they might have been able to mount a better defense. The federal courts rejected their argument on grounds of procedural default, which provides that issues cannot be raised in federal court appeals unless they have first been raised in state courts.\n",

Clarey.[8] He then attended a junior college in California, and worked for several technical and vocational schools before making his conspiracy theories known, beginning in 1988. Cooper expanded the speculations of earlier conspiracists by incorporating government involvement with extraterrestrials as a central theme.[9]\n",

A variety of incidents with law enforcement in 1982 culminated when local sheriff's deputies and state law enforcement officers attempted to serve bench warrants for the arrest of three members of the church and a large group of church members confronted them. In the ensuing melee, two church members were killed and seven law enforcement officers were injured. One church member and one law enforcement officer died later, both deaths possibly due to injuries sustained that day.\nThe church was led by Pastor Frances Thomas, one of a reported 10,000 disciples of broadcasting evangelist A. A. Allen\u2019s original Miracle Valley Bible Church (MVBC).  Her son, William Thomas Jr., was a bishop and the church's theoretical leader.[1]\nThomas attempted to purchase the 2,560-acre property and its numerous buildings that were previously home to Allen\u2019s MVBC, with plans to re-establish the original church under her leadership.  However, the owners at the time were prohibited from selling this property, situated on the south side of Arizona State Route 92 that bisects Miracle Valley.  Therefore, Thomas instead purchased several properties for the church's use in the subdivision along the north side of the highway across from the MVBC, including a restaurant that was converted to a church sanctuary.[2]\n",

Two years later he was having an affair with a married woman and filed for divorce, accusing her of being \"a morphine fiend and a common slut.\"[citation needed] Handy publicly stated that any lawyer who defended her \"would be sorry\", and repeatedly threatened to kill her attorney Francis J.

During the American Old West, the canyon was a key route for smugglers into and out of Mexico.\nThe two survivors said they had been attacked by Mexicans. Historians generally believe that the smugglers were killed by Mexican military forces patrolling the border to try to reduce smuggling.[1] Some sources repeat the assertion of attorney William McLaury, who was part of the prosecution related to the 1881 gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which two of his brothers had been killed. He wrote that Wyatt Earp and his two brothers had killed Clanton and his associates, and this has been repeated in some sources.[2]\n",

It was fought on October 8, 1901, within Arizona Territory's Fort Apache Indian Reservation, at a clearing in the forest known today as the \"Battleground\". Nine Arizona Rangers and deputies caught up with the cattle rustler Bill Smith and his gang. During a long exchange of gunfire that followed, Ranger Carlos Tafolla[3] and Deputy Bill Maxwell[4] were killed and one or two of the outlaws may have been wounded. In the end, the Smith Gang escaped the posse and fled into Mexico.[2]\nThe Arizona Rangers were established in 1901 and the Battleground Gunfight became the first major shootout to involve the new police force. The Smith Gang was one of the first targets for the rangers. In northeastern Graham County, Bill Smith owned a ranch on the Blue River, where he lived with his mother and his younger brothers and sisters. The ranch house served as a base for rustling cattle from nearby settlers, such as Henry Barrett, a former Rough Rider. In 1898, the Smith brothers were arrested for stealing unbranded calves from Barrett and Bill Phelps. Bill Smith assumed full responsibility, so he was sent to jail at St. Johns. Because of this, Bill was said to have developed a grudge against Henry Barrett. During the first week of October 1901, the Smith Gang was spotted at Pat Knoll, near Springerville, heading south with a herd of fifteen or twenty stolen horses. Police informants said the gang was on their way from Utah, where they robbed a train. A few days later, Bill and his brother Al came across Henry Barrett and another cowboy in the Big Cienega range. During the confrontation, Bill threatened to kill Barrett, so the latter informed the sheriff of Apache County, who organized a posse.[2]\nThe posse was led by the sheriff's deputy, Hank Sharp, and included Henry Barrett and two other locals named Pete Peterson and Elijah Holgate. Meanwhile, the Arizona Rangers Carlos Tafolla and Duane Hamblin were assigned to search for the Smith Gang. At Greer, the rangers and the posse met, and they decided to work together in tracking and capturing the outlaws. The rangers then deputized Barrett, Peterson and Holgate and they began following the outlaws' trail to the Little Colorado River, which they forded at a place known as Sheep's Crossing. From there the posse went to the ranch of Lorenzo Crosby to enlist his services and that of the brothers Arch and William Thomas \"Bill\" Maxwell,[4] both of whom were described as being excellent scouts. These three men were deputized as well, making the posse a force of nine men altogether. After that, the posse continued along the trail south to Big Lake and then to Dead Man's Crossing on the Black River. On October 7, at a ranch belonging to Pete Slaughter, the posse found an abandoned camp that was believed to have been recently occupied by the outlaws. The rangers decided to camp at the same location for the night and then proceed down the west side of the riverbank on the following morning.[2]\n",

Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348 (2004), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a requirement that a different Supreme Court decision requiring the jury rather than the judge to find aggravating factors would not be applied retroactively.[2]\nIn April 1981, Warren Wesley Summerlin killed a creditor who had come to his home in Phoenix, Arizona, to inquire about a debt.  He was later convicted of first-degree murder and received a death sentence.  Under Arizona law at the time, a jury decided the question of guilt but a judge sitting without a jury decided the question of penalty after receiving evidence regarding aggravating and mitigating factors.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the death sentence.  While the appeal in his habeas corpus case was pending in the Ninth Circuit, the Supreme Court decided Ring v. Arizona,[1] which held that such aggravating factors had to be proved to a jury rather than a judge. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the Ring decision applied to Summerlin's case even though Ring was decided after Summerlin's conviction had become final on direct review. The state appealed this decision to the Supreme Court.\nThe Court, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, reversed the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and stated that \"we give retroactive effect to only a small set of 'watershed rules of criminal procedure implementing the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.' That a new procedural rule is 'fundamental' in some abstract sense is not enough; the rule must be one 'without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.\"\n",

Although a self-proclaimed badman, he was well-liked by many settlers, who treated him as a Robin Hood-like character rather than a typical criminal. According to Old West historian Marshall Trimble, Chacon was \"one of the last of the hard-riding desperados who rode the hoot-owl trail in Arizona around the turn of the century.\" He was considered extremely dangerous, having killed about thirty people before being captured by Burton C. Mossman and hanged in 1902.[1]\nChacon was born in 1861 in the northwestern Mexican state of Sonora, which was a sparsely populated wilderness at the time. He is first recorded in history as being a peace officer in the town of Sierra del Tigre, though he also found work hauling wood and ore at some point. In 1888 or 1889, Chacon moved across the international border to Morenci, Arizona, where he became known as an \"excellent cowboy throughout the Arizona Territory.\" However, in 1890, he had a disagreement with his employer, a rancher named Ben Ollney, about three months' worth of pay. For some reason, Ben refused to pay Chacon his wages so the two \"exchanged heated words\" before the latter rode off towards Safford in disgust.\nAfter spending the night drinking, Chacon armed himself and then returned to the ranch on the next day with the intention of collecting his money. Once again, Ollney refused to pay, but he went even further by insulting Chacon and laughing at him. Ollney attempted to draw his pistol, but Chacon drew first and shot his antagonist dead. Five cowboys rushed to the scene to avenge their slain employer, but Chacon held his ground and shot all of them. Four of them died, but the fifth escaped to Whitlock Springs, where he raised the alarm. Ben Ollney's brother lived at Whitlock Springs and quickly organized a posse of six men to go after Chacon, who by that time was fleeing south towards the border. The posse followed Chacon's trail to a box canyon, cornered him in and then called out for his surrender, but Chacon equipped himself with two revolvers and charged his pursuers on horseback. Four more cowboys were killed and Chacon rode off with a slight arm wound.[2][3]\n",

Inheriting a love of literature from his mother, who died when he was eleven, he quickly gained in stature as an up-and-coming American author.[2] In 1871, he published a novel, Two College Friends, and a book of poems, The Boston Dip and Other Verses. Two College Friends, in which two Harvard students serve together in the Civil War, has been singled out as an important example of the representation of romantic male friendship.[3] He also made numerous contributions, both fiction and non-fiction, to such periodicals as  The Atlantic Monthly, Appleton's Journal, Old and New, The Independent, and Every Saturday during this time.\nIn the spring of 1871, Appleton's Journal sent Loring as a correspondent on a cartographic expedition to Arizona led by Lieutenant George M. Wheeler of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The articles Loring wrote included \"A Council of War,\" \"A Glimpse of Mormonism,\"[4] \"Silver Mining in Nevada,\" and \"The Valley of Death.\" Their party suffered several setbacks, and in August 1871 Loring wrote to his employers from Death Valley: \"I am bootless, coatless, everything but lifeless. I have had a fortnight of horrors. This morning an Indian fight capped the climax. However, I am well and cheerful.\"[5] Although they escaped from the valley, his party's carriage was attacked on November 5 by a band of Yavapai near Wickenburg, Arizona, while on the way to La Paz. That ambush came to be known as the Wickenburg Massacre. The driver, Loring, and four other passengers were killed.[6]\n",

In May 1982, Santa Maria Unit, for all custody levels of female inmates, began admitting inmates. ASPC-Perryville was converted to an all female facility in 2000. ASP-Yuma, a 250-bed adult male prison which opened in 1987 became a part of the Perryville Complex in October 1992 until November 1995 when it became its own prison complex Arizona State Prison Complex - Yuma. The Fourth of the housing units at ASPC-Perryville (previously San Juan) is named after Brent W. Lumley, an ADC correctional officer who was killed in the line of duty.[3]\n",

As a teenager, he attended Douglass High School in Oklahoma City and, once in college, attended the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) programs, aspiring to become a military officer. At age 22, he moved to Phoenix, Arizona, but with nowhere to live, he recommended his aunt Melva Willis bring his trailer behind their home. Subsequently, while in Phoenix, Morris picked a job up at a karaoke machine in a local bar named Fat Cats, which local prostitutes and pimps visited frequently. Thanks to his friendly manner, Morris made friends with plenty of neighbors and coworkers, whom they subsequently nicknamed \u201cHuggy Bear.\u201d[3]\nAs victims, Morris targeted female sex workers whom he arranged meetings with. Later, during his confessions, Morris claimed all the women had died either of a drug overdose, but abruptly changed all of the stories to claim he accidentally strangled them. \n",

November 1987) was an American girl from Washington state who was murdered by firearm at age 16 and remained unidentified for 27 years. Criswell's body was found on November 25, 1987 in Marana, Arizona, near Tucson.[2] The Marana Police Department announced her identification on February 11, 2015, aided by the sophisticated technology of forensic facial reconstruction and DNA analysis, and by websites set up by amateurs to help identify missing and unidentified persons.\nAfter Criswell's parents divorced, family members became estranged, and Criswell had periods of running away from home. She was never officially reported as missing. In 2014, Criswell's aunt and uncle, who had last seen her when she was only a baby, began to look for her. They began to search newly available online databases, focusing on unidentified persons in Arizona after learning that their niece had called her sister from Tucson in late 1987. They came across \"Jane Doe 19\"'s profile online at the Doe Network and believed the young woman's image, from a forensic facial reconstruction prepared by the FBI in 2010, resembled their niece. The aunt and uncle contacted law enforcement, who obtained DNA from family members and were able to confirm the match.\nAuthorities strongly suspected that William Ross Knight was the killer; Criswell had been involved with him when she went to Tucson. He had died in 2005 of illness in prison, where he had been sentenced on robbery charges. He had used a .22 caliber pistol in a robbery, the same size of the gun that killed Criswell.[3]\n",

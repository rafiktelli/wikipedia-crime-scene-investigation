Meach, III (1948\u20132004) was a mentally ill American murderer who killed five people in Alaska.\nHe was born in Traverse City, Michigan, to a mother who had schizophrenia. He left home at sixteen to travel and accumulated a long record of minor crimes.[1]\nHe made his way to Anchorage, Alaska, and in 1973 he beat 22-year-old Robert Johnson, who worked as a grocery clerk, to death in Earthquake Park.[1] He was charged with murder, found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to a mental hospital in California. In 1980, psychiatrists decided that his illness was in remission and he was returned to Alaska under the supervision of the Alaska Psychiatric Institute. On May 3, 1982, armed with a .38-caliber revolver that he had bought from a man on the street, he shot four teenagers to death in Russian Jack Springs Park; two 19-year-old boys while robbing their campsite and one 16 year old girl and one 17 year old girl. The teens were planning on going to the movies, when Meech shot them in cold blood. [2][3] He confessed to the killings when confronted and was charged.[4] He again pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, but was convicted and sentenced to 396 years in prison without the possibility of parole \u2014 the longest sentence in the state's history.[5]\n",

Wade pled guilty to one of the murders in federal court to avoid execution. Seven years later, as part of a plea deal, he confessed to three additional murders, including one which he had previously been acquitted of, dating back to 1994 in exchange for a transfer to a federal prison.\nJoshua Alan Wade was born on March 13, 1980, in Anchorage, Alaska. He never met his father and raised solely by his mother, who resorted to placing him in an acquaintance's care so she could work. Unknown to her, that same acquaintance started sexually abusing her son when he was five.[1] This greatly affected Wade, who bottled up his feelings, stopped going to church and developed an addiction to marijuana. After suffering a failed romance as a teenager, he began to develop anger issues and soon after started getting in trouble with law enforcement.[2] According to his father, sister and several friends, Wade openly expressed his hatred of women, particularly towards Alaska Natives.[3]\nWade's first confessed murder was that of 38-year-old John Michael Martin, an unemployed schizophrenic who was found shot to death along a bike trail in Anchorage in May 1994. Shortly before his death, Martin had left a Village Inn he regularly visited to have coffee with friends. At the time of the murder, Wade was 14 years old and had no known connection to his victim.[2] Five years later, in December 1999, he claimed to have killed 30-year-old Henry Ongtowasruk at a motel in Knik-Fairview. His victim suffered from a mental illness and had lived at the motel for approximately a week before he was found shot to death by an employee in one of the rooms. Like Martin before him, Ongtowasruk had no known prior connection to Wade.[2]\n",

Ramsey is serving two 99-year prison sentences and will be eligible for parole in 2066 when he is 85.[citation needed]\nReports say in the two weeks prior to the incident, more than 15 students knew of Ramsey's intention to commit a school shooting, and two actually assisted him.[1] One student, named James Randall, taught him how to load and fire a shotgun. Another student, named Matthew Charles, told him of the infamy that would come.[2] Reports say that several students brought cameras to school on the day of the shooting, and that many students were watching the shooting from a library balcony overlooking the student commons area.[3]\nOn February 19, 1997, Ramsey armed himself with a Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun, and arrived at Bethel Regional High School by school bus. He approached the student commons area, brandishing the shotgun, and shot 15-year-old Josh Palacios in the abdomen. Palacios later died after emergency surgery. He then shot and injured two other students. Reyne Athanas, an art teacher, entered the commons area after hearing the gunshots. Athanas said she tried and failed to convince Ramsey to surrender. He then entered the main lobby, where he shot principal Ron Edwards twice, killing him. \n",

When interest in the gold rush peaked, he set up his swindle operations in Skagway and quickly became the region's underworld boss, just as he had done in Denver and Creede.[2]\n",

The spree culminated in a shootout with Alaska State Troopers in the Alaskan wilderness in which Silka was shot and killed. The motives for Silka's actions remain unclear.\nMichael Silka grew up in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. From an early age, he had a love of firearms and the outdoors, and had a history of encounters with the law. In 1975, Silka and another juvenile were apprehended while trying to steal camping gear and weapons from a Des Plaines sporting goods store.[1] That same year, Silka and his brother Steve ran away from high school to the Canadian wilderness, returning when they had depleted their provisions.[2] In February 1977, four months before graduating from Hoffman Estates High School, Silka was arrested for carrying an antique black-powder muzzle-loading rifle \u2014 reminiscent of the weapons used by early mountain men \u2014 through a park in the suburb. He was arrested again for the same offenses later that year.[1] Silka was convicted and paid a $100 fine.[3]\nShortly thereafter, Silka enlisted in the United States Army, at least partly on the advice of a longtime neighbor, Forman Hurst, who later recalled him as \"a good kid, a typical teenager. He loved the outdoors. That was his No. 1 ambition, to be outside exploring nature.\"[3] In 1981, he was stationed at Fort Wainwright, located on the East side of Fairbanks, Alaska, until his discharge the same year.[4] Army records show that Silka was rated an expert marksman with the M16 rifle and grenade launcher while in basic training.[1] However, his stay at Fort Wainwright was marked by several run-ins with military police, including an assault charge and an arrest for discharging a firearm in a barracks.[3]\n",

For several months the three lived in the same house in Anchorage.[4] On May 2, 1996, Leppink (age 36) was found dead in Hope, Alaska, with three .44 caliber Desert Eagle gunshot wounds.[2] Linehan was arrested over 10 years later in October 2006 and convicted of his murder on October 22, 2007, but the verdict was overturned in February 2010.[2]\nAt trial, Linehan was accused of conspiring with John Carlin to kill Leppink.[1] The government said that Linehan's motive was that she was the beneficiary of Leppink's $1 million life insurance policy.[5] Leppink changed the beneficiary on the policy a few days before his death.[6][7]\n",

A long-haul trucker, Fautenberry befriended and subsequently murdered five people across four states between 1990 and 1991,[1][2] and after his arrest, confessed to an additional 1984 murder for which another man was convicted. He was sentenced to death for one of his killings, and subsequently executed at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in 2009.[3]\nBorn on July 4, 1963 in New London, Connecticut,[n 1] Fautenberry was the illegitimate son of a Navy seaman. Rejected by his father and grandparents, young John was placed in the care of his mother, who went on to marry twice more. He was ignored by his stepfathers, suffering beatings for the smallest of mistakes, once for confusing a potato salad with tomato salad. According to Fautenberry, he would use an imaginary hammer to nail his and his sister's blankets to the beds, in an effort to not get taken away by malicious forces.[4] The family often changed residences, shifting between Ohio and Hawaii before moving to North Kingstown, Rhode Island in 1983.[5] By that time, Fautenberry had already had run-ins with the law: he had stolen a 1968 Chrysler in Atlanta, but was later captured in Heflin, Alabama after leaving a gas station without paying for gas.[6]\nIn 1985, his mother died of cancer, leading Fautenberry to become even more disillusioned and untrustworthy of people, with him developing a growing addiction to drugs and alcohol.[4] In order to support himself, he held several short-term jobs as a long-haul trucker, travelling all across the United States, but was often fired for poor performance and negligence.[7] By the time his murders began, he acquired several more convictions for minor offenses, including carrying a concealed weapon in Ohio and a public disturbance charge in Ledyard, Connecticut.[5]\n",

Between December 28, 1869, and April 14, 1950, between the Department, District, and Territory of Alaska, twelve felons, all male, were executed by hanging for murder, robbery, and other crimes.[1] Some were European, some were Native American, and two were African.[2] The territorial legislature abolished capital punishment in 1957 during preparations for statehood, making Alaska the first in the West Coast of the United States to outlaw executions, along with Hawaii, which did the same.\nThere is no recorded history of any executions occurring in Alaska prior to its purchase by the United States government and its designation as the Department of Alaska. There are only four recorded executions in Alaska during the 19th century.[1]\nThe first recorded execution to occur in the Alaskan Territory was that of a Stikine Native American, only known by the name Scutd-doo, on December 29, 1869. The Espy Files have his name misspelled as \"Scutdor.\"[1] Scutd-doo was convicted of murdering Leon Smith, a naval commander, on December 25, 1869. Leon Smith's murder was in retaliation for the murder of Scutd-doo's relative, a brother or cousin known as Lowan or Si-Wau,[3] who had been murdered by American soldiers after being involved in an altercation with them in which he bit off the finger of the wife of the quartermaster of Fort Wrangell. The murder of Leon Smith prompted an incident known as the Wrangell Bombardment, wherein the United States Army issued an ultimatum to the Stikine village of Old Wrangell demanding Scutd-doo's surrender. Two days after the United States Army and Stikine villagers exchanged fire, Scutd-doo was handed over to the United States Army, court-martialed, and publicly hanged in front of his fellow villagers on December 29, 1869, only four days after Smith's murder. The hanging occurred during the daytime; Scutd-doo's body was left hanging until nightfall to serve as a warning.[4][5]\n",

Sometimes referred to as \"The Corrupt Bastards Club\" or the \"Operation Polar Pen\", the investigation focused on the oil industry, fisheries and for-profit prison industries.\nBy the spring of 2006, the FBI set up in a Baranof hotel suite just three blocks away from the capitol building in Juneau. From their position in the hotel suite, they gathered evidence, such as a videotape of VECO's CEO Bill Allen arranging paper money for legislators, and made other observations. By August 2008, the investigation resulted in indictments against six sitting or former Alaska Republican state legislators on corruption charges. In August 2008 US Senator Ted Stevens was indicted and, by October, he was convicted in Washington, D.C. on seven felony counts of failure to disclose gifts. The convictions, eight days before the November 2008 election, resulted in his narrow loss, after 40 years in the U.S. Senate, to Democrat Mark Begich. His convictions were later set aside because of prosecutorial misconduct and the United States Department of Justice ended further prosecution.\nIn addition to the conviction of US Senator Stevens, two executives of the VECO Corporation, an oilfield services contractor, pleaded guilty to charges of bribery and conspiracy to impede the Internal Revenue Service. Alaska businessmen/lobbyists Bill Weimar (former for-profit halfway house owner) and Bill Bobrick, as well as Jim Clark, the former governor's chief of staff, also were indicted and convicted. Clark's guilty plea and sentence were later vacated before he was ordered to report to custody. That was followed by ex-Alaska State Rep. Bruce Weyhrauch's Supreme Court challenge to the honest services fraud statute. His case was decided on June 24, 2010, in association with the Skilling v. United States and Conrad Black case decisions. While the Court overturned the Skilling conviction, stating that the honest services fraud statute was not applicable to private citizens, the Court upheld, but narrowed the application of the honest services fraud statute by stating that it was applicable to public officials only, and remanding Weyhrauch's conviction to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n",

She was aged between 16 and 25 at the time of her death, and her body was discovered several months after her murder. An autopsy report concluded that she had been killed by a single stab wound to the back.[3][4]\nEklutna Annie was murdered by serial killer Robert Hansen, most likely in 1979. Hansen specifically stated she was his first murder victim.[5][3]\nThis unidentified decedent became known as Eklutna Annie due to the location in which her body was discovered. The case remains open, and numerous efforts have been made to determine the identity of the decedent, including several forensic facial reconstructions of how she may have appeared in life.[6]\n",

McCunn was born in Munich, Germany, where his father was stationed by the United States Army. He was raised in San Antonio, Texas, graduated from high school in 1964, and enlisted in the United States Navy shortly after dropping out of community college. McCunn served in the Navy for four years and was discharged in 1969. He briefly lived in Seattle, Washington, before settling in Anchorage, Alaska, in 1970.[2][3]\nI keep thinking of all the shotgun shells I threw away about two months ago. Had five boxes and when I kept seeing them sitting there I felt rather silly for having brought so many. (Felt like a war monger.) So I threw all away ... but about a dozen ... real bright. ... Who would have known I might need them just to keep from starving?\n",

Between 1971 and 1983, Hansen abducted, raped, and murdered at least seventeen women in and around Anchorage, Alaska; he hunted many of them down in the wilderness with a Ruger Mini-14 and a knife. He was arrested and convicted in 1983, and was sentenced to 461 years without the possibility of parole.[2][3] He died in 2014 of natural causes due to lingering health conditions at age 75.\nRobert Christian Boes Hansen was born in Estherville, Iowa, at Coleman Hospital on February 15, 1939, the elder of two children to an American mother and a Danish father.[4] The family moved to Richmond, California in 1942, but returned to Iowa in 1949, settling in Pocahontas.[5] His mother was Edna Margret Petersen.[6] His father Christian Hansen (1907\u20131983) owned a bakery in the town, and Robert was employed at the bakery. In his youth, he was painfully shy, had a stutter and severe acne that left him permanently scarred. Not receiving the attention he wanted from the attractive girls in school, Hansen grew up hating them and nursing fantasies of cruel revenge.[7]\n",

Two people were killed and two people were wounded by student Evan Ramsey. Ramsey is serving two 99-year prison sentences and will be eligible for parole in 2066 when he is 85.[citation needed]\nReports say in the two weeks prior to the incident, more than 15 students knew of Ramsey's intention to commit a school shooting, and two actually assisted him.[1] One student, named James Randall, taught him how to load and fire a shotgun. Another student, named Matthew Charles, told him of the infamy that would come.[2] Reports say that several students brought cameras to school on the day of the shooting, and that many students were watching the shooting from a library balcony overlooking the student commons area.[3]\nOn February 19, 1997, Ramsey armed himself with a Mossberg 500 12-gauge shotgun, and arrived at Bethel Regional High School by school bus. He approached the student commons area, brandishing the shotgun, and shot 15-year-old Josh Palacios in the abdomen. Palacios later died after emergency surgery. He then shot and injured two other students. Reyne Athanas, an art teacher, entered the commons area after hearing the gunshots. Athanas said she tried and failed to convince Ramsey to surrender. He then entered the main lobby, where he shot principal Ron Edwards twice, killing him. \n",

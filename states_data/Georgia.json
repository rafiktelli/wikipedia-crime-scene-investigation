The Georgia Supreme Court twice granted Blackman a new trial, but he was convicted and sentenced to hang a third time in September 1888. Blackman was twice granted respite by Georgia Governor John Brown Gordon after the third trial, which delayed Blackman\u2019s execution by three months. Blackman maintained his innocence until his public execution and insisted that he was never given an impartial trial. 5,000 people from across South Georgia travelled to Ellaville, a town of a few hundreds, to witness the hanging. Telegraph wires were cut to ensure that messages from Governor Gordon and other state officials would not be transmitted and interfere with the hanging.\nStonewall Tondee was the 22-year-old son of the Treasurer of Schley County, Georgia, and worked as a store clerk in Ellaville. Late in the evening on Saturday September 5, 1885, Tondee was waiting on customers in the store when someone outside in a cotton patch shot him through the window with a shotgun.[1] Patrons in the store called out for help, and a doctor reached him five minutes after the shooting.

He was a chief of Coweta town and commander of a mounted police force. He became a large-scale planter, built and managed a successful inn, and operated a commercial ferry business. Early American historians attributed McIntosh's achievements and influence to his mixed race Scots/European ancestry. Since the late 20th century, historians have argued much of McIntosh's political influence stemmed more from his Creek upbringing and cultural standing, particularly his mother's prominent Wind Clan in the Creek matrilineal system, and to other aspects of Creek culture.[2]\nBecause McIntosh led a group that negotiated and signed the Treaty of Indian Springs in February 1825, which ceded much of remaining Creek lands to the United States in violation of Creek law, for the first time the Creek National Council ordered that a Creek be executed for crimes against the Nation.[3] It sentenced him and other signatories to death. McIntosh was executed by his long-time political nemesis Menawa and a large force of Law Menders in late April 1825.  Two other signatories were executed and another, while McIntosh's son Chilly was shot at, but escaped unharmed.  Menawa signed a treaty in 1826 that was very similar in both language and benefits, but one which the Creek National Council had agreed to and was therefore considered a legitimate treaty according to contemporary Creek law.\n"

During this time, the white supremacist terrorist group KKK was in its prime. KKK members were responsible for multiple lynchings of black people who decided to vote following Snipes' murder. For example, two black couples were lynched five days later.[3] Prior to the election, the KKK had made threats to lynch any black person who dared cast a vote. Snipes and his mother were both sharecroppers on Homer Chapman's land in Butler, Georgia. The day after Snipes cast his vote, four white men pulled up to the land Chapman rented to Snipes' family. All four were suspected KKK members: two were later identified as Edward Williamson and Lynwood Harvey, both WWII veterans.[4]\nHaving pulled up outside Snipes' grandfather's house, the four white men asked Snipes' mother to call him outside. They then confronted him, and it ended with Williamson shooting Snipes in the back. After the men left, Snipes and his mother walked to Chapman's house. Chapman helped them walk 3 miles to the hospital in Butler. The hospital staff did not treat Snipes until six hours later. By then, he needed a blood transfusion. The staff claimed that they did not have any \"black blood\". Two days later, Snipes died in the hospital from his injuries. Williamson was an initial suspect in the investigation. In front of a coroner's jury, he claimed that Maceo owed him a $10 debt. Supposedly, Williamson and Harvey went to Snipes to confront him on his debt. Williamson said that Snipes had pulled out a knife, so he shot Snipes twice in the back, claiming self-defense. Coroner J.D. Cooke and a jury declared Williamson's actions as justified.[5] Williamson was exonerated on his charges on July 29, 1946.[6]\n"

His mother testified against the sons during the jury trial which sentenced both to hanging. 21 days later the sentence was carried out. \nIn the Big Creek assault, a black preacher and his congregation drove to Cumming to demand the release of the men being held for the rape of a young girl from the Big Creek Community. This resulted in a white counter mob showing up in confrontation. Tempers flared and the preacher was harshly beaten for having been heard to suggest that the first woman may have had a consensual relationship with a black man. The Forsyth County Sheriff locked the preacher inside the court house over night to protect him from the mob waiting outside. \n"

        "paragraph": "The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pittsburgh Panthers. The game was played on January 2, since New Year's Day was a Sunday. Much controversy preceded the 1956 Sugar Bowl. Segregationists and Georgia governor Marvin Griffin used all his political power in an attempt to keep Pitt fullback/linebacker Bobby Grier from playing because he was black. But ultimately, Bobby Grier played making this the first integrated Sugar Bowl and is the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.[1]\nThis game occurred during segregation battles in the south, including Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and the murder of Emmett Till (1955).  The Sugar Bowl had been racially segregated since its first inception in 1935.  No black players had ever taken the field in it.[2]  There were even different sections of the stadium set aside for black and white attendees.[3]  In the past, most Southern colleges (including Georgia Tech) were all-white and had an unofficial \"gentleman's agreement\" with integrated Northern schools in which the teams would only play against each other if the African American players on the team were benched for the game.[4]  By the 1950s, this agreement was starting to break down, with some Northern schools refusing to honor it and some Southern schools agreeing to play against integrated teams so long as the game took place in the North.  Many Southern schools responded to this shift by simply refusing to play Northern schools at all, resulting in a significant decline in inter-sectional gameplay.  The Bowl games, most of which took place in the South, became a focal point of contention.  The Cotton Bowl in Dallas held its first integrated game in 1948, and the Sun Bowl in El Paso held one in 1950.[5]  But up to 1956, most Southern games still remained strictly segregated.\n"

        "paragraph": "The Augusta Riot was a collective rebellion of Black citizens in Augusta, Georgia, and the largest urban uprising in the Deep South during the Civil Rights era. Fueled by long-simmering grievances about racial injustice, it was sparked by White officials\u2019 stonewalling in the face of Black citizens\u2019 demand for answers about the beating death of Black teenager Charles Oatman. At its height on the evening of May 11, 1970, two to three thousand people participated, ransacking and setting fire to White- and Chinese-American-owned businesses, damaging $1 million of property over a 130-block area.[1]  White police officers violently suppressed the riot, with the endorsement of Georgia governor Lester Maddox, shoot-to-kill orders from their captain, and reinforcements by the National Guard and State Patrol. Despite the suppression, the riot fundamentally shook the status quo, galvanizing a new wave of activism that opened economic and political doors for Augusta\u2019s Black citizens.\nPolice brutality and severe poverty were deeply woven into the fabric of White supremacy in Augusta, and they showed no signs of weakening as a new decade dawned.[2]  Augusta\u2019s Black organizations had different visions for bringing change: NAACP and SCLC chapters sought to expand on gains of the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Panther Party chapter and a cadre of Paine College students embraced the militancy and self-assertion of Black Power, and the Committee of Ten embodied a middle way, with a militant style but a focus on confronting White officials. Simmering tensions came to a head on the evening of May 9, when news began to circulate that Charles Oatman had been beaten to death in the county jail. The 16-year-old was a popular student at A.R. Johnson Junior High School. He was also mentally challenged. In a grim accident in late March, Oatman had fatally wounded his young niece in the kitchen of his family\u2019s small house, but White authorities charged him with killing her and incarcerated him. Over the course of several weeks in the jail, he was brutally tortured and beaten, ultimately dying of his injuries. His badly mutilated body, with cigarette burns, marks from a fork, and a deep gash in the back of his head, was brought from the jail to University Hospital and then to Mays Mortuary on May 9.[3]\n"

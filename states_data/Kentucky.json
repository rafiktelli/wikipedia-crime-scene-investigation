Multiple street fights raged, leaving twenty-two people dead, scores injured, and much property destroyed by fire. Five people were later indicted, but none were convicted, and the victims were not compensated.\n"

Dietrich released the names of her attackers and argued publicly that they were not adequately punished despite being instructed not to discuss the case by the presiding judge. International controversy regarding the case developed when attorneys for the boys attempted to have her held in contempt, but the motion was subsequently dropped.\n"

The intersection, and Parkland in general, had recently become an important location for Louisville's black community, as the local NAACP branch had moved its office there.\nThe crowd was protesting against the possible reinstatement of a white officer who had been suspended for beating a black man some weeks earlier. Several community leaders arrived and told the crowd that no decision had been reached, and alluded to disturbances in the future if the officer was reinstated. By 8:30, the crowd began to disperse.\nHowever, rumors (which turned out to be untrue) were spread that Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee speaker Stokely Carmichael's plane to Louisville was being intentionally delayed by whites. After bottles were thrown by the crowd, the crowd became unruly and police were called. However the small and unprepared police response simply upset the crowd more, which continued to grow. The police, including a captain who was hit in the face by a bottle, retreated, leaving behind a patrol car, which was turned over and burned.\n"

A mob of people from Kentucky and Virginia took him from the jail and away from town and hanged him, and riddled his body with shots.[2] The killing, which became widely publicized, was the last in a long line of extrajudicial murders in the area, and, prompted by the activism of Louis Isaac Jaffe and others, resulted in the adoption of strong anti-lynching legislation in Virginia.[3]\nAs happens frequently with lynchings, accounts printed by white newspapers differed considerably from those found in Black newspapers. The white papers had Woods (and two young Black women) essentially jumping onto a car (driven by Deaton, who was accompanied by two friends) and then shooting Deaton, a young Virginia man from a well-to-do family who was a foreman in a Kentucky mine. The narrative in the Black papers, prompted by a report written for the NAACP, provided background information that suggested that the two Black women involved may have been prostitutes involved with Deaton and his two companions, and that Woods had some kind of relationship with one or both of the women. The lynching, then, would have served to avert a trial in which Woods's testimony might have harmed the reputation of Deaton, his friends, and his family.\n"

Three police officers and a police dog were killed, and four others were injured, including three police officers. The alleged shooter, 49-year-old Lance Storz, was arrested and charged with murder and attempted murder of a police officer.[1][2][3]\nFloyd County Sheriff John Hunt reported that around 2:30\u00a0p.m. on June 30, an officer received a phone call from someone who alleged that Lance Storz was holding a woman against her will and abusing her. The officer and another went to the home, where the woman was outside, and went with officers, who found Storz to be still inside the home. Storz's home was on an elevated spot that had a clear field of fire for about 200 yards with one single-lane road leading up to the property.[4] With testimony from the woman, officers procured a protection order for the woman and went to Storz's home to arrest him over the assault allegations.[5]\n"

Wesbecker, a 47-year-old pressman, killed eight people and injured twelve at his former workplace, Standard Gravure, before committing suicide. The shooting is the deadliest mass shooting in Kentucky's history.[1] The murders resulted in a high-profile lawsuit against Eli Lilly and Company, manufacturers of the antidepressant drug Prozac, which Wesbecker had begun taking during the month prior to his shooting rampage.[2]\nOn September 14, 1989, Wesbecker, who was nicknamed \"Rocky\" by his colleagues, parked his car in front of the main entrance of Standard Gravure and entered the plant at 8:38\u00a0a.m., carrying a Polytech AK-47S, (a Chinese-made semiautomatic AK-47 derivative), a SIG Sauer P226 9mm pistol, and a duffel bag containing two MAC-11s, a snubnosed .38 caliber Smith & Wesson Model 12 Airweight revolver, a bayonet, and several hundred rounds of ammunition.[2]\nHe took the elevator to the executive reception area on the third floor and, as soon as the doors opened, he fired at receptionists Sharon Needy, whom he killed, and Angela Bowman, who he paralyzed with a shot in the back. Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed down the stairs to the pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.[2]\n"

Thompson before escaping without him getting a good look.[1] Thompson was able to stumble to a nearby house and get help. Word quickly spread about the crime and that the attackers were two black men. On October 31, 1919, an enraged and armed white mob made up of hundreds of Corbin's townspeople organized and went house-to-house rounding up black residents.[2] When they felt that all of the African-Americans of the town had been gathered, the mob marched a group of approximately 200 men, women, and children to the train station, and herded them onto cramped railcars. The train departed with its human cargo and were sent south to the town Knoxville.[1][3][4][5] \"They swore at us and said: 'By God we are going to run all Negroes out of this town tonight,'\" said longtime black Corbin resident John Turner in a signed affidavit about the incident.[2]\nThis uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that began with the American Red Summer, in April 1919 - terrorist attacks on black communities and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African-American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington DC; however, more deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people were killed. Also, in 1919, were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot in which 38 and 39 people (respectively) were killed.  Both events also had many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.[6]\n"

The coal miners desired improved working conditions, higher wages, and more housing options for their families.[1] These reasons, along with other factors, led the miners to go on strike. It ended when the Kentucky National Guard was called in to break it up.[2] This battle lasted approximately 15 minutes.\nNumerous forces and factors were involved in the so-called battle. Opposing the miners were the heavily armed private \"police\" ordered by the company to break up the strike, while other associations chose not to become involved.[2] The United Mine Workers of America, or UMWA, considered helping the miners, but once it realized the amount of resources required, decided not to offer support. The Red Cross also decided not offer any support, saying the strike was an \"industrial dispute\" which did not involve them.[3] The Black Mountain Coal Company's hired gunmen were eager to fight, and were responsible for the deaths that followed.[4]\nThe 'Battle of Evarts' began on the morning of May 5, 1931. The company had ordered a motorcade to drive to Harlan to deliver goods to the 'Scabs' (non-union miners who had been hired to replace those on strike) there.[5] The motorcade consisted of just three cars, with a sheriff's deputy in each one. The deputies correctly expected violence, and had prepared for some sort of attack. The striking miners waited for the motorcade near the Evarts railroad, and as the motorcade approached them, a single shot rang out. No one knows who fired it, but each side blamed the other. The motorcade halted, and Deputy Jim Daniels, one of the most hated anti-union deputies in the county, jumped out and hid behind a rock.[5] Daniels raised his head to fire at the miners, but as soon as he did so, he was fatally shot and killed. The exchange of gunfire lasted for fifteen minutes, with an estimated 1,000 shots fired. When it ended, the three deputies and one miner lay dead.[5]\n"

This is the first Black Lives Matter protest in Barbourville and was organized by the Tri-County Fairness Coalition. The crowd took a knee and engaged in an eight minute and 46 second moment of silence; the amount of time Derek Chauvin spent kneeling on George Floyd's neck while he was murdering Floyd. Floyd's murder and the death of Louisville's Breonna Taylor spurred protests across the country over racism and police brutality.

At least sixteen people, including one child, were killed during the course of the feud, and many others were seriously injured.[1] The feud took place primarily in the border areas of Hawkins County (formerly part of Sullivan County, North Carolina, one of the earliest Tennessee counties and said to have a large Melungeon population), Washington County, Claiborne County, Hancock County, Tennessee (created when Hawkins County, Tennessee was subdivided), and Lee County, Virginia, not far from Cumberland Gap, the narrow Appalachian Mountain pass sometimes called The Wilderness Road leading into Kentucky.\nMost of the history of this feud is found in family records, particularly in a self-published small-edition book by Alton Lee Greene, a genealogist who lived in Sanger, Texas. Alton Lee Greene (a 20th-century descendant of the feuding families) traced the genealogy of the descendants of American colonist Judge William Greene, a judge in the Court of Common Pleas who was born in Lincolnshire, England in 1671 and died in 1722 in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.[2] Judge Greene married Joanna \"Hannah\" Reeder, the daughter of John Reeder and Joanna  Burroughs Reeder, who was born in 1699 in Newtown, Long Island, New York.  Judge William Greene and Hannah settled in the area of Ewing, New Jersey and built the William Green House (Ewing Township, New Jersey), now on the National Historic Register and located on the campus of The College of New Jersey. Despite fund-raising efforts, the old farmhouse near where the troops of George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River once rested during the Revolutionary War, has never been fully restored.[3]\nJudge William Greene and Joanna Reeder Greene were the great-grandparents of Jeremiah Greene, who along with other Greene relatives migrated to an area near Rowan, North Carolina (a vast county of indefinite boundaries formed in 1753), where they formed a community called The Jersey Settlement by joining West Jersey residents who left New Jersey due to their unwillingness to adhere to the demands of Colonel Daniel Coxe, an English Colonial landowner and physician. Disgusted by Coxe's rampant political corruption, the Greene family settled near the Yadkin River in North Carolina and started the Jersey Settlement Meeting House, now on the National Historic Register. Jeremiah's family migrated to the Jersey Settlement and then to Hancock County, Tennessee, where his descendants figured prominently in the Greene\u2013Jones War.[4]\n"

The intersection, and Parkland in general, had recently become an important location for Louisville's black community, as the local NAACP branch had moved its office there.\nThe crowd was protesting against the possible reinstatement of a white officer who had been suspended for beating a black man some weeks earlier. Several community leaders arrived and told the crowd that no decision had been reached, and alluded to disturbances in the future if the officer was reinstated. By 8:30, the crowd began to disperse.\nHowever, rumors (which turned out to be untrue) were spread that Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee speaker Stokely Carmichael's plane to Louisville was being intentionally delayed by whites. After bottles were thrown by the crowd, the crowd became unruly and police were called. However the small and unprepared police response simply upset the crowd more, which continued to grow. The police, including a captain who was hit in the face by a bottle, retreated, leaving behind a patrol car, which was turned over and burned.\n"

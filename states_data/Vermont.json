Her poetry and prose is collected in A Fire Is Burning, It Is In Me: The Life and Writing of Michiyo Fukaya.[5][6]\nMichiyo suffered from depression for a significant part of her life and had a difficult time living as an Asian-American lesbian and single mother in Vermont. As a result, she committed suicide with a gunshot wound to the head on 9 July 1987 at only 34 years of age.[7]\n",

Emeline Meaker was not pleased with the arrangement and beat, starved, and otherwise mistreated Alice.[1][2]\nMeaker decided to kill Alice, and ordered her son Almon to get a lethal dose of strychnine from an apothecary. On April 23, 1880, Meaker and Almon seized Alice, placed a sack over the girl's head, and took her to a remote area outside Waterbury, Vermont, near what is now Little River State Park. When they arrived at a clearing by a stream, Almon handed the poison to his mother and she poured it into a drink which she gave to Alice. While Alice thrashed about in reaction to the strychnine poisoning, Meaker forcibly held her hand over Alice's mouth to keep the girl from crying out, keeping it there until Alice was dead, and then Almon and his mother buried Alice's body.[1][2]\n",

He confessed to two of these murders and remains a suspect in the third, but was convicted of only one and sentenced to a 30-year-to-life sentence.\nGary Lee Schaefer was born in 1951 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, one of several children born to Edwin and June Schaefer. Sometime during his childhood, the entire family moved to Springfield, Vermont, where they joined a closely-knit Christadelphian congregation based in the city.[1] From a young age, Schaefer was considered as an overtly quiet, yet very friendly and reliable child who constantly did what he was told without any objections.[2] While studying at the Springfield High School, he took part in the school's cross country running and track and field teams, where it was said that he showed a lot of athletic potential. After graduating in 1970, Schaefer enlisted in the Navy (Christadelphian churches do not allow their members to be recruited into the armed forces generally), where he served from April 1975 to 1981, being stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes; Orlando, Florida; Bethesda, Maryland; Newport, Rhode Island and Norfolk, Virginia.[3] Later on, it would be revealed that he was court-martialed for setting fire to his apartment, for which he served a 13-month sentence at a military facility in Norfolk.[4] He had married his wife Arlene while working at a hospital in Falmouth, Massachusetts, with whom he had two a daughter, Jodie, and a young son, who passed away from SIDS. She and Schaefer's living daughter later moved to North Charleston, South Carolina.[5]\nUpon his return to Springfield, Schaefer got a job as an auto mechanic at Soucy Motors, where he was described as a good employee who never created trouble.[2] In addition, he was also an active member of his church, working as a custodian and sometimes even giving sermons on the Bible to younger churchgoers,[6] and took care of his mother after his father passed away from cancer on April 10, 1982.[2] Accounts from friends and family report that favorite hobby outside of church duty was to cruise around town in his car, playing Styx songs.[3] Despite these positive qualities, Schaefer was still considered a loner, was divorced and still lived on the family farmhouse.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Connecticut River Valley Killer is the name given to an unidentified American serial killer believed to be responsible for a series of stabbing murders mostly in and around Claremont, New Hampshire and the Connecticut River Valley, primarily in the 1980s.\nIn the mid 1980s, three young women disappeared around Claremont. In 1985 and 1986, the skeletal remains of two of the women were recovered within a thousand feet of each other in a wooded area in Kelleyville, New Hampshire. The condition of the remains made the cause of death difficult to determine, but certain factors pointed to multiple stab wounds. Between the recovery of the first and second bodies, a 36-year-old woman was stabbed to death in a frenzied attack inside her home in Saxtons River, Vermont. Ten days later, the remains of the third missing woman were found; an autopsy again revealed evidence of multiple stab wounds.\nAt this point, investigators began examining prior homicides in the area and found two previous cases, in 1978 and 1981, that further reinforced the presence of a burgeoning serial killer. At the peak of the investigation, and after additional homicides and one non-fatal attack, investigators noted similarities in modus operandi, often-used dump sites, and specific wound patterns that linked many of the murders, suggesting a common perpetrator.\n",

Vermont still has pre-Furman capital statutes on the books but these have been left unenforceable due to Furman. Most states changed their capital punishment laws to conform with Furman and Gregg v. Georgia, but the Vermont legislature has yet to do so, effectively abolishing the death penalty in the state.[1][2][3] The state last executed a prisoner, Donald DeMag, in 1954, after he received the sentence for a double robbery-murder he committed after escaping prison.\nAlthough DeMag was the last person executed by Vermont, he was not the last person to be sentenced to death by a Vermont court. Lionel Goyet, a soldier who was Absent Without Leave for the fifth time, robbed and killed a farmhand, and was sentenced to death in 1957.[4]  His sentence was commuted six months later,[5] and Goyet was conditionally pardoned in 1969.[6] He had no further problems with the law, and died of heart failure in 1980.[7]\nVermont still has a pre-Furman statute providing death by electrocution for treason, though the state's execution chamber has since closed.[8]\n",

He is remembered as one of the \"notorious Yorkers\" who resided for some time in eastern Vermont, and for his participation in Loyalist armies during the American Revolution.[1]\nCrean Brush was born in Dublin, Ireland, about the year 1725.[2] Educated for the bar, he held a military office prior to emigrating to the Thirteen Colonies in British America, reaching New York City before 1762. There he married his second wife, Margaret Montuzan.[1]\nBrush was first employed by the deputy secretary of the Province of New York, Goldsbrow Banyar, and in 1761 was licensed as an attorney in all of the king's courts in the province. It is supposed he became associated in this profession with John Kelly, who also figures in the Vermont records.[1] In New York, he found employment in the office of the Provincial Secretary.[2]\n",

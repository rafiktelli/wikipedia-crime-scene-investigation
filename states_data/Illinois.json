One of only a few southerners within the syndicate, Dauber quickly proved to be a valuable member of \"The Outfit.\" As Catuara's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Dauber was suspected in over 20 unsolved homicides, between 1969 and 1980, in the decade-long struggle for Steven Ostrowski's lucrative South Side chop shop operation. \nIn 1973, Dauber was convicted of mail fraud and the interstate transportation of a stolen car used in an unsolved murder. After his release in 1976, Dauber joined rival mobster Albert Caesar Tocco as a top enforcer who had slowly gained control of the Southside. Shortly after Dauber's defection, Catuara was found shot to death in his red Cadillac on July 28, 1978. \n",

After working his way up the ranks at a Philadelphia dry goods house, he began his own store in Burlington, Iowa in 1842. He became active in Iowa politics, serving in the Iowa Senate from 1854 to 1862. In 1855, he was the Democratic Party candidate to the United States Senate, but lost. In 1862, he moved to Chicago, Illinois to set up a banking house which became the Union National Bank of Chicago. Coolbaugh was also the father-in-law of Chief Justice of the United States Melville Fuller. Coolbaugh died of an apparent suicide in 1877.\nWilliam Findlay Coolbaugh was born in Pike County, Pennsylvania on July 1, 1821 to Moses and Mary Coolbaugh. He was raised on the family farm and attended school in the winter. William Bross was one of Coolbaugh's teachers. When he was fifteen, three years after his last schooling, Coolbaugh left the family to work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He took a position as an assistant porter in a dry goods house. When he was eighteen, he was promoted to confidential clerk. He continued to learn the trade and was eventually tasked with all Western operations of the dry goods house. In 1842, Coolbaugh left the house to set up his own operation in Burlington, Iowa. He sold goods for eight years, then left the business to become a banker. Co-founding Coolbaugh & Brooks, his bank was eventually merged into the Burlington Branch of the State Bank.[1]\nCoolbaugh was active in early Iowa politics as a Democrat. The First General Assembly named him the state's first Loan Agent in 1847. He was a delegate to the 1852 Democratic National Convention and voted for Stephen A. Douglas in all 49 ballots. In 1854, Coolbaugh was elected to the Iowa Senate, serving until 1862. Coolbaugh was the Democratic candidate for United States Senate in 1855, but was narrowly defeated by James Harlan. He chaired the Iowa delegation to the 1856 Democratic National Convention. Coolbaugh sided with the War Democrats upon the outbreak of the Civil War, supporting the Union.[1]\n",

Raymond pitched a no-hitter that year, as well, and led Charleston to the pennant.[2] The Cardinals purchased him in September, and in 1908, he was the best pitcher on the team. His 2.03 earned run average ranked tenth in the National League, and his 145 strikeouts were fourth-best. During the 1908 season, he gave up fewer hits per game than Christy Mathewson and threw five shutouts, but he was also on the mound eleven times when the Cardinals failed to score.[3]\nRaymond was known for his spitball and got his nickname because of his zany antics on the mound. What might have been a promising career was short-circuited by a severe addiction to alcohol. The only manager who could keep Raymond in line for any length of time was hard-nosed Giants manager John McGraw. McGraw picked him up in the Roger Bresnahan trade before the 1909 season, and Bugs won 18 games for him that year.[2]\n",

Unsatisfied with a teaching career, he was drawn to journalism and decided to 'go west'.  In 1827, he reached St. Louis, Missouri.  Due to the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Missouri had entered the United States as a slave state.  Lovejoy edited a newspaper but returned east for a time to study for the ministry at Princeton University.  On his return to St. Louis, he founded the St. Louis Observer, in which he became increasingly more critical of slavery and the powerful interests protecting slavery.  Facing threats and violent attacks, Lovejoy decided to move across the river to Alton in Illinois, a free state. But Alton was also tied to the Mississippi River economy, easily reachable by anti-Lovejoy Missourians, and was badly split over pro-abolitionist and anti-abolitionist views.\n",

It tried to subvert his activities in Chicago, sowing disinformation among black progressive groups and placing a counterintelligence operative in the local Panthers organization.

Chicago was developing into an attractive opportunity for many immigrants.[3] Although the jobs that awaited the immigrant were often poor-paying wage based positions, opportunities were often more promising than that of their home country. The immigrants settled in their own neighborhoods, German immigrants congregating mainly on the North Side, across the Chicago River from City Hall and the older Protestant part of the city. The German settlers worked a six-day week, leaving Sunday as their primary day to socialize; much socialization took place in the small taverns that dotted the North Side of Chicago.[4] German-language newspapers, such as the Illinois Staats-Zeitung and social movements like the Turners and German craft unions gave the German population of Chicago a high degree of social and political cohesiveness.[5] Additionally, the Forty-Eighters among them had previously used demonstrations as a political tool during the European revolutions of 1848.\n",

The location was along 92nd Street in Raymond, Wisconsin.[8] Her death had occurred within one day prior to the discovery of her body.[9][10] Johnson's injuries were apparent and her right arm was bent \"unnaturally\" behind her.[7][11] Because it had rained on the night her body was dumped, little evidence of the perpetrator was found, although she was placed at the scene about 12 hours prior, before precipitation occurred.[2][3] The witness stated the body had not been at the location the day before. Based on marks on her body, she appeared to have been dragged 25 feet from the roadside.[12]\n",

The rioters failed to overtake the police stationed at the jail and the Illinois National Guard restored order the next day.\nA black man, James Wilson, had been arrested for the assault of a white woman in Alvin, Illinois, north of Danville. A mob of about 600 formed to storm the county jail in Danville to kill Wilson. En route, they encountered another black man, a native of Evansville, Indiana, who has been variously identified as J. D. Mayfield, John D. Metcalf, or Bud Fruit. In the ensuing altercation, he shot and killed a member of the mob. Mayfield was intercepted by police and was taken to the nearby police station. Officers barricaded the doors, but they were unable to hold back the mob. Mayfield was captured and taken to the spot where the altercation occurred. There, he was lynched by hanging on the nearest telephone pole.[1]\nAfter Mayfield died, the mob took down is body and brought it to the Danville public square in front of the county jail. The mob burned Mayfield's body, shot at it, and hacked it into pieces. The mob, which had grown to about 1,000 people, was able to batter the door of the jail down, but the sheriff and the deputies managed to shoot several of the rioters. The mob retreated and reorganized. Two miners in Westfield brought dynamite to destroy the walls of the jail, but they were intercepted by police in Himrod.[1]\n",

A former Prussian Army soldier who immigrated to the United States, Lamm believed a heist required all the planning of a military operation. He pioneered the concepts of \"casing\" a bank and developing escape routes before conducting the robbery. Using a meticulous planning system called \"The Lamm Technique\", he conducted dozens of successful bank robberies from the end of World War I.\nIn 1930,  Lamm committed suicide when surrounded by a law-enforcement party in Sidell, Illinois,[4] after a botched heist. Lamm's techniques were studied and imitated by other bank robbers across the country, including the famous John Dillinger.\n",

It is written by Scott Turow and marks his return to non-fiction for the first time since One L in 1977.\nTurow bases his opinions on his experiences as a prosecutor and, in his years after leaving the United States Attorney's Office in Chicago, working on behalf of death-row inmates, as well as his two years on Illinois's Commission on Capital Punishment, charged by then-Gov. George Ryan with reviewing the state's death penalty system.  Turow, a self-described \"death penalty agnostic,\" presents both sides of the death penalty debate and admits that over time he seems to change sides, depending on the argument.  He finally concludes that \"the pivotal question instead is whether a system of justice can be constructed that reaches on the rare, right cases, without also occasionally condemning the innocent or the undeserving,\" and reveals \"[t]oday, I would still do as I did when Paul Simon asked whether Illinois should retain capital punishment. I voted no.\" (pp.114-115)\nTurow's reflections include:\n",

Roe earned the nickname \"Robin Hood\" because of his philanthropy among the neighborhood poor.[1][2] After refusing to pay \"street tax\" or hand over his illegal gambling empire to the Chicago Outfit, Roe fatally shot a made man who had been ordered to assassinate him.\nRoe was born in Galliano, Louisiana to an African American sharecropper, and raised in Little Rock, Arkansas.[3]  As a child, he received no formal education, and when he was of age, he did odd jobs for a tailor and learned how to sew. Some time after that, he got involved in bootlegging and gained a notorious reputation as a colorful racketeer who could pass for white. His career as a bootlegger ended after a few years and he moved to Detroit, where he worked in an automobile plant. When he was 31 years old, he took what he learned working for the tailor in Arkansas, and moved from Detroit to Chicago and began working for an African American tailor named Edward P. Jones. Shortly after Roe began working for Jones, Jones decided to get involved in policy and he made Roe his first \"runner\", or salesman of lottery chances. Under the protection of politicians Edward Joseph Kelly and Patrick Nash, the Kelly-Nash Machine, Jones was making $2000 a day by 1930. By 1938 he had increased his earnings to $10,000 per day and Roe was pulling down nice cuts from the profits. They soon caught the attention of The Chicago Outfit after Jones met Sam Giancana in prison, and they set out to take over the numbers racket in Chicago. The Jones-Roe wheels were netting over $25 million annually, by 1946 and the mob, seeking to move in on the Jones brothers and Roe, kidnapped Ed Jones and held him for a ransom that included $100,000 and a promise to relinquish his policy business. Roe paid the $100,000 ransom but after Jones was released, he decided not to give up his share of the business. However, the Jones brothers fled to Mexico, leaving the entire business to Roe.\nChicago Outfit capo, Sam Giancana, who was attempting to take over the Southside gambling operations, ordered an attempt to kidnap Roe. On June 19, 1951, Roe ended up killing one of the kidnappers, Fat Lenny Caifano, who was not only a made man, but also the brother of capo Marshall Joseph Caifano.\n",

Unrest in the city began as a response to the murder of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. The demonstrations and riots, supporting justice for Floyd and protesting police brutality, occurred simultaneously with those of over 100 other cities in the United States. Chicago is among 12 major cities that declared curfews in order to prevent looting and vandalism.[4] On May 31, Mayor Lori Lightfoot asked Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker to send the Illinois National Guard to Chicago for the first time in the 52 years since the 1968 riots in Chicago.[5] The economic damage caused by the disturbances exceeded $125 million.[6][7]\nOn May 28, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot compared Floyd's murder to the murder of Laquan McDonald, saying \"there but for the grace of God goes Chicago.\"[8] Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown required officers to watch the video of Floyd's murder and undergo training on positional asphyxiation.[9]\n",

In 2001, he was convicted and sentenced to death, but the following year, in response to numerous miscarriages of justice in other cases, the Governor of Illinois George Ryan imposed a moratorium on capital punishment, commuting all prisoners' sentences to life imprisonment.[1][2]\nLorenzo Fayne was born on April 2, 1971, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in a family of several other brothers and sisters.[3] Fayne spent his childhood and adolescence in the northwestern part of the city, a region plagued by poverty and crime. He grew up in an unstable family, as both of his parents had scrapes with the law, suffered from alcohol and drug dependancies, and frequently subjected Lorenzo to beatings, from which he suffered psychological trauma. In 1978, at the age of only 7, he was sexually assaulted by a neighbor boy. In his teen years, he spent a lot of time on the streets, often skipping school and failing academically, eventually dropping out of school altogether. Between 1984 and 1989, he was arrested several times for robbery, burglary, assault and auto theft, spending several years in juvenile prisons, where he was also physically and sexually assaulted by fellow inmates. During his incarceration, an IQ test determined his IQ to be between 68 and 75 points, qualifying him as borderline intellectually disabled. In 1989, after he was released from prison, Lorenzo left Milwaukee and moved in with his grandmother, Nelly Willis, in East St. Louis, Illinois, where he lived for the next four years.[4][5]\nFayne first came under suspicion as a suspect in the July 23, 1993, murder of 17-year-old Faith Davis, who lived next door from his grandmother's house. Davis had been attacked in her apartment, during which she was raped and stabbed to death. In order to erase the evidence, the killer set fire to the apartment, but was spotted by witnesses, who identified him as Lorenzo Fayne. Police soon arrived to interrogate him, and while examining his clothes and home, blood stains were located. Fayne was taken to the police station, where he would eventually confess to robbing Davis' apartment, but refused to admit any involvement in her murder. On August 4, while examining fingerprints found at the crime scene, it was determined that it matched the ones found on the body of 6-year-old Aree Hunt, a young boy who had been raped and strangled on July 14, 1989, not far from Fayne's grandmother's house. After he was confronted with these findings, Lorenzo confessed to murdering both Hunt and Davis. According to his testimony, the motive for killing Aree was an inferiority complex, which drove him to commit these vicious crimes so he could feel better about himself. After his family learned about his confessions, his grandmother talked to him in late August, during which Fayne confessed to three additional killings. They were of 14-year-old Latondra Dean, raped and stabbed to death on March 20, 1992; 9-year-old Fallon Flood, raped and strangled on July 20, 1992, and 17-year-old Glenda Jones, who was raped and stabbed to death on June 25, 1993. All of the victims lived and were killed within a several hundred meter radius from the house in which Lorenzo and his grandmother lived. He was also suspected of killing another girl: 16-year-old Nicole Willis, who was raped and beaten to death a few hundred meters away from the East St. Louis High School on October 16, 1989, but Fayne denied having anything to do with her death.[6][7][8]\n",

Her 17-year-old roommate, Ranko Carol Yamada, was also severely wounded, yet survived. The murder caused a significant stir within the Japanese-American community, in part because Yamada alleged that the killer was African-American, just at the height of violence associated with the Black Panther Party.[1] The killer was never found.[2]\nEvelyn Okubo was 18 years old and hailed from the Japanese community of Stockton, California.[3] She and Ranko Carol Yamada had traveled to Chicago as representatives of the Japanese-American youth organization Yellow Seed to the national convention of the JACL, which was then focused on fighting for racial justice and against the Vietnam War.[3] Prior to the murder, Okubo was believed to have attended racial issue discussion meetings with groups like the Black Panthers and the Young Lords, a Latino community organization with roots as a Chicago street gang.[4]\nOn July 17, 1970, Okubo was murdered, and Yamada was slashed in the throat, in Room 725 of Chicago's Palmer House hotel.[5] Yamada, though badly wounded, wrote out several messages: \"Gory, but it doesn't really hurt,\" \"He was a black man with a natural,\" and \"Don't blame him it was not his fault. There must be absolute peace.\"[1] When the victims were discovered about half an hour later by a third JACL attendee sharing the hotel room, both girls had been stripped naked and bound, though neither showed evidence of being raped.[5] Yamada could not speak for two weeks after the incident due to her throat injury, but eventually recounted that the attacker had pranced around naked before killing Okubo.[6]\n",

When she tried to leave the store, owner Michael \"Big Mike\" LaPota and his employees wrestled Woods to the floor, reportedly to prevent her from fleeing or smashing liquor bottles. African-American witnesses recounted that LaPota and his employees beat Woods before she was arrested; she was taken to a hospital by police.[2]\nThe next day at 11 a.m. on August 16, demonstrators picketed Foremost Liquors, protesting LaPota and his assault of Woods. They carried signs that read, \"Big Mike Must Go,\" \"Mike Beats Negro Women,\" and \"Dixmoor Police are Afraid of Big Mike.\" This protest escalated into violence and a riot.[3]\n",

His father was abusive towards Armstrong and his mother, and sexually abused Armstrong when he was a child. In 1978, Armstrong's younger brother, Michael, died at two-months-old from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Because of the grief caused by Michael's death, Armstrong attempted to end his life. Shortly thereafter his father left him and his mother. Armstrong did not receive treatment for his grief until 1989, a year after he was hospitalized for locking himself in a bathroom because a girl at school was pressuring him to have sex with her.[1]\nArmstrong joined the United States Navy in 1992.[3][2] His rackmates have described him as \"moody.\" He allegedly killed his first victim in 1991, although this is not confirmed. Between 1993 and 1998, researchers believe Armstrong murdered 11 women, all of whom were prostitutes. He claims to have killed in Seattle, Washington; Hawaii; Hong Kong, China; North Carolina; Virginia; Thailand; and Singapore. He was honorably discharged from the Navy in 1999, and enrolled at Schoolcraft College in Livonia, Michigan afterwards.[1]\n",

Following an extensive investigation into his death, the murder trial was, at the time, the longest-running trial in U.S. history.[2] Cronin's murder caused a public backlash against secret societies, including protests and written condemnations by the leadership of the Catholic Church.\nCronin grew up in the U.S. and Canada, and moved to the Midwestern United States after the American Civil War. He became a physician and a prominent member of high society, and represented St. Louis at the Exposition Universelle (1878). While in St. Louis, Cronin joined multiple clubs, among them, the Irish nationalist organization, Clan na Gael. When he moved to Chicago, Cronin continued his involvement with Clan na Gael. After criticizing the leadership of the Chicago camp of Clan na Gael, he was expelled from the group and accused of being a British spy. In May 1889, Cronin disappeared. Later that month, public works employees discovered his body in a sewer in a northern suburb of Chicago. The press coverage of the investigation and trial caught international attention.[3] Cronin's funeral drew the largest crowds for a funeral since the arrival of Abraham Lincoln's body in Chicago.

An autopsy revealed that Naab was three months pregnant.

In March 1911, the so-called Shotgun Man reportedly murdered four people within 72 hours.[3] The neighborhood was well-known for Italian immigrant and Italian-American violence, and the Shotgun Man is assumed to have been involved in the \"underworld\".\nAlthough the killings were witnessed by dozens of bystanders, the Chicago police were never able to identify the murderer. However, he was said to be well known throughout the Italian community and, with the political influence of the Black Hand, residents may have been hesitant to turn in the assassin.[4] Although the fate of Shotgun Man is unknown, he seems to have disappeared from Little Italy shortly before Prohibition, as extortion operations of the Black Hand had faded away by the end of the decade.\nThis crime-related article is a stub.

Johnson and Sarah Ann Davisson and named after the abolitionist Senator John P. Hale.[1] During the Civil War his father served as assistant surgeon while he enlisted into Company D, 135th Indiana Infantry at the age of 17. At the end of the Civil War his family moved to Illinois.\nHe was a lawyer and became mayor of Newton, Illinois. In 1882, Johnson left the Republican Party after supporting every Republican presidential candidate from 1868 to 1880 because it did not support a constitutional amendment for national alcohol prohibition.[2] In 1884, Johnson was the Prohibition Party's candidate for Illinois Attorney General.[3] In 1892, he was elected as the Prohibition Party's national chairman and served in that position until 1896. In 1896, he was the Prohibition Party candidate for governor of Illinois, but later that year he was nominated party's candidate for vice president in the 1896 presidential election and campaigned in over 30 states. He was a narrow gauger who supported a platform with one plank for prohibition unlike the broad gaugers who supported free silver and women's suffrage being added to the platform.[4]\n",

It was one of many similar labor conflicts in the coal mining regions of Illinois that occurred in 1898 and 1899.\nThe United Mine Workers of America had called a strike that affected numerous mines; mine owners retaliated by hiring guards and some 300 African-American miners from Alabama to serve as strikebreakers. After a confrontation in which a white union miner was killed, the miners turned on black strikebreakers, believing them responsible. Two whites were killed in the violence and five blacks, with another six African Americans wounded.\nStriking white miners had been out of work for nearly a year when the Overholt brothers, part owners of one of the four Pana mines, went to Alabama to recruit African-American \"scab\" labor (strikebreakers) in an effort to re-open the mines. Previous attempts to open the mines with white non-union workers had failed amid violence. The state had stationed militia in Pana to preserve peace. Nearly 300 African Americans were recruited to work in the mines and break the strike. \n",

During the mid-1930s, Gioe, Paul \"The Waiter\" Ricca and Louis \"Little New York\" Campagna, began financially supporting extortion operations by Willie Morris Bioff and George Brown against Hollywood movie studios.  In exchange for annual payoffs to the Outfit, the mob-controlled  projectionist unions would refrain from labor strikes and disruptions.\nIn the late 1930s, the extortion racket was busted by law enforcement.

He played on hundreds of recordings by many pre\u2013World War II blues artists. Under his own name, he was one of the most recorded blues musicians of the 1930s and 1940s and is closely associated with Chicago producer Lester Melrose[2] and Bluebird Records. His popular songs, original or adapted, include \"Good Morning, School Girl\", \"Sugar Mama\", \"Early in the Morning\", and \"Stop Breaking Down\".\nWilliamson's harmonica style was a great influence on postwar performers. Later in his career, he was a mentor to many up-and-coming blues musicians who moved to Chicago, including Muddy Waters. In an attempt to capitalize on Williamson's fame, Aleck \"Rice\" Miller began recording and performing as Sonny Boy Williamson in the early 1940s, and later, to distinguish the two, John Lee Williamson came to be known as Sonny Boy Williamson I or \"the original Sonny Boy\".\nWilliamson was born in Madison County, Tennessee, near Jackson, in 1914.[3] His original recordings are in the country blues style, but he soon demonstrated skill at making the harmonica a lead instrument for the blues and popularized it for the first time in a more urban blues setting. He has been called \"the father of modern blues harp\". While in his teens he joined Yank Rachell and Sleepy John Estes,[1] playing with them in Tennessee and Arkansas.

He finished seventh in the long jump competition at the 1920 Summer Olympics.[2] He also played in the National Football League for the Hammond Pros, Akron Pros, Canton Bulldogs, Buffalo Bisons, and Rock Island Independents. Referenced sometimes as Edward Solomon Butler, was a name used by alternate people to gain notoriety off the exploits of Solomon W. Butler in various parts of the country.[3]\nButler was born in Kingfisher, Oklahoma, the youngest child of Ben and Mary Butler. His father was from Morgan County, Alabama, and born a slave in 1842; his mother was born in Georgia in 1867. His father fought in the Civil War and took the last name of Butler from General Butler whom he admired. The Butler family escaped slavery and settled in Wichita, Kansas, before moving to Hutchinson, Kansas, in 1909. \"Sol\", as he was known, made the varsity football team as a starting halfback during his freshman year. He led the school in football and in track and field. His sophomore year, he helped Hutchinson to a runner-up finish at the state meet after setting state records in the 100-yard dash. In 1913, as a junior in Hutchinson High School (Kansas) at a district meet he won six firsts, broke five meet records and unofficially broke a world record in the 50-yard dash. He along with his older brother Benjamin followed his high school coach to Rock Island High School in Rock Island, Illinois, for his senior season in 1914. Facing 300 of the best track stars of the Midwest in Chicago, he competed in the regional interscholastic meet held at Northwestern University. He placed in the 60-yard dash and hurdles, the 440 yard dash, and also in the broad jump. He broke one meet record, tied a world record, and won fourth place overall, competing against entire track teams.\nButler earned 12 varsity letters competing in football, basketball, baseball and track and field at the University of Dubuque from 1915 to 1919. According to Arthur Ashe Jr.'s book Hard Road to Glory, A History of the African-American Athlete, Butler was the first African American to quarterback a team for all four years of college. In Butler's day, the track and field of activity was restricted. There was no national collegiate meet and very little indoor competition. Even the Drake Relays, then in their formative years, provided no such event as the broad jump. Butler went to the Penn Relays for that competition and twice won the championship. In 1919, to illustrate, Butler won both the 100-yard dash and broad jump at the Penn Relays. Entering military service as a soldier in World War I as he represented the U.S. Army in the Inter-Allied Games in Paris, where he won the long jump. He was knighted by the King of Montenegro, who made Butler a Knight of the Third Order of Danilo. With the Olympic Games scheduled for renewal in 1920 after the wartime interruption in 1916, Butler was rated as a heavy favorite for the championship. His winning jump at Paris, 24\u00a0feet 9.5\u00a0inches (7.557\u00a0m),[4] was two inches from the Olympic record and was considered a strong possibility for a new Olympic record. Butler went to Antwerp for the 1920 Olympics, but misfortune nailed him quickly. On his very first jump in the Olympic preliminaries he pulled a tendon and was forced to withdraw. The injury-hampered effort was a shade under 21-8. He won the U.S. National Amateur Athletic Union championship that same year by jumping 24\u00a0feet 8\u00a0inches (7.52\u00a0m).[2][5][6]\n",

He moved back to Philadelphia and worked in the mercantile business with his father. In 1845, he moved to Peoria, Illinois and studied to be a civil engineer. In 1857, Tyndale was elected County Surveyor of St. Clair County, Illinois. President Abraham Lincoln appointed Tyndale postmaster of Belleville, Illinois in 1861. From 1865 to 1869, Tyndale served as Illinois Secretary of State, as a Republican. After Tyndale left office, he stayed in Springfield, Illinois and worked for Gilman, Clinton and Springfield Railroad doing a survey. His brother was Hector Tyndale, a United States Army officer.[1]\nIn 1867, Tyndale himself requested that the Illinois General Assembly authorize a redesign of the seal, with one key suggestion, that the words of the motto (State Sovereignty, National Union) be reversed (to National Union, State Sovereignty). The legislature did authorize the redesign but specifically required the redesign to maintain the motto's word order. Then they gave Tyndale responsibility for the redesign. Tyndale overhauled the Great Seal, but he did so in a manner that appeared to thwart the legislature's intent. His new seal featured a twisted banner, which caused the word \"sovereignty\" to be upside down, albeit, in the order required by the legislature. Tyndale's banner has remained in place, with only minor changes, since 1868.[2]\n",

The townspeople of Cairo formed a mob and murdered him, along with a second prisoner from the town jail whose trial had been delayed. The lynching drew crowds of thousands, and led the Illinois State Legislature to pass a series of anti-lynch and anti-mob laws that led to major reforms throughout the Midwest involving the sentencing and protections for African American people in Illinois. The lynching also mobilized advocacy groups in the state to push for more legal protections of African-American communities in smaller towns.\nCairo, Illinois, had been experiencing a surge of racial tension due to a crime wave at the end of 1909. The town police force was lethargic due in large part to the town economy being primarily based on vice-related activity.[5] Underground liquor establishments were common, and prostitution brought in considerable income. Most of the town's crime occurred in \"low-dens\" of the city, and involved organized crime. Racial tensions had been relatively low before the crime wave began. With the police force acting very slowly, the mob assembled and took matters into their own hands.\n",

The strike affected a total of thirty different mills belonging to the three companies, which employed 80,000 workers. The strike, which was one of the most violent labor disputes of the 1930s, ended without the strikers achieving their principal goal, recognition by the companies of the union as the bargaining agent for the workers.\nOn March 13, 1937, the United States Steel Corporation (US Steel) signed a historic collective bargaining agreement with SWOC.[1] The agreement provided for a standard pay scale, an 8-hour work day, and time and a half for overtime. Although US Steel (\"Big Steel\") signed the deal, there were smaller companies that refused to sign. That is why the strike is known as the \"Little Steel\" strike: US Steel Corporation was so massive that it gave rise to the moniker \"Little Steel\" for its four smaller competitors, Republic Steel Corporation, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company, and Inland Steel Company, each ranked among the hundred largest firms in America.[1]\nThe strike did not start immediately. In fact, there was an expectation that Little Steel would follow Big Steel's lead and sign a deal with SWOC. On March 30, 1937, SWOC proposed an agreement similar to the one with US Steel to Little Steel. The proposal sought an eight-hour work day, a forty-hour work week, overtime pay, a $5-per-day minimum wage, paid vacations, health and safety standards, seniority, and procedures for resolving grievances. Rather than sign, Little Steel representatives met, debated, dragged their feet, sent spies to infiltrate SWOC, and prepared for actual battle. The companies bought poison gas and other weapons, hired private police, donated weapons to official law enforcement, encouraged law enforcement to hire more deputies, stocked their plants with food and bedding, installed search lights and barbed wire, and fired hundreds of union workers.\n",

Preliminary internal police reports described the incident similarly, leading to the shooting being judged as justifiable, and Van Dyke not being charged at the time.[5] This was later disproved after a video of the encounter was released, showing that McDonald was walking away.\nOn November 24, 2015, thirteen months after the shooting, a court ordered the police to release a dash cam video of the shooting. It showed that McDonald was walking away from the police when he was shot 16 times by Officer Van Dyke. That same day, Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder, and was initially held without bail at the Cook County Jail.[6] He was released on bail on November 30.[7] The city reached a settlement with McDonald's family for $5 million in April 2015. On October 5, 2018, Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder, as well as 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm.[8]\n",

Jailed in November 1899 for the murder of a former school friend, Honeck was paroled from Southern Illinois Penitentiary in Chester, Illinois on 20 December 1963, having completed 64 years and one month of his life sentence, and served a total of 23,418 days in jail.[1]\nHoneck, a telegraph operator and son of a wealthy dealer in farm equipment, was 20 years old when he was arrested in Chicago in September 1899 for the murder of Walter F. Koeller. He and another man, Herman Hundhausen,[2] had gone to Koeller's room armed with an eight-inch Bowie knife, a sixteen-inch Bowie knife, a silver-plated case knife, a .44 caliber revolver, a .38 caliber revolver, a .22 caliber revolver, a club, and two belts of cartridges. They also carried a getaway kit consisting of two satchels filled with dime novels, obscene etchings, and clothes from which the names had been cut.[3]\nKoeller, who was later found by the police sitting in a chair stabbed in the back, had testified for the prosecution some years earlier when Honeck and Hundhausen were charged with setting a number of fires in their home town of Hermann, Missouri.[3][4]\n",

Two black men had been arrested as suspects in a rape, and attempted rape and murder. The alleged victims were two young white women and the father of one of them. When a mob seeking to lynch the men discovered the sheriff had transferred them out of the city, the whites furiously spread out to attack black neighborhoods, murdered black citizens on the streets, and destroyed black businesses and homes.  The state militia was called out to quell the rioting.\nThe riot, trials and aftermath are said to be one of the most well-documented examples of the complex intersection of race, class, and criminal justice in the United States.[1][2]  In 2008 an NPR report on the centenary of the race riot said that the fact of its taking place in a Northern state, specifically in \"The Land of Lincoln\", demonstrated that blacks were mistreated across the country, not just in the South, and described the event as a proxy for the story of race in America.[3]\nAt least sixteen people died as a result of the riot: nine black residents, and seven white residents who were associated with the mob, five of whom were killed by black residents and two committed suicide. It was misreported for decades that only militia were responsible for white deaths and that more whites than blacks had died. Personal and property damages, suffered overwhelmingly by blacks, amounted to more than $150,000 (approximately $4\u00a0million in 2018), as dozens of black homes and businesses were destroyed, as well as three white-owned businesses of suspected black sympathizers.[4][5][6]\n",

The police had no substantive physical evidence linking the two men to the crime. Their first trial was jointly in 1987, and their statements were used against each other and a third defendant.\nAfter appeals and other court actions, during which they remained in prison on death row, each of these two men was tried twice more. Hernandez was convicted each time and sentenced the last time to life. Cruz was acquitted in 1995 at his third trial after a sheriff's lieutenant recanted previous testimony, and new DNA evidence was introduced excluding Cruz and Hernandez from that found at the crime scene. The state dismissed all charges against Hernandez that same year; he was already serving his sentence in prison. Both men were freed.\nIn 1996 the state indicted seven DuPage County law enforcement officials for conspiracy to convict Cruz and wrongful prosecution. They were acquitted but Cruz, Hernandez and Steven Buckley (one of the three original defendants) filed a civil suit against DuPage County.\n",

At this time it was theorized that Slover could have been the victim of a car-jacking, as investigators did not view her as likely to have voluntarily left the area due to her recently signing with a modeling agency for a job.[4]\n",

He was held at Pinckneyville Correctional Center and at one time was the longest serving inmate incarcerated by the State of Illinois as well as the third longest in state history before his release on February 21, 2020.[2] On November 21, 2019, the Illinois Prisoner Review Board granted parole to Weger by a vote of 9\u20134.[3] He was released on parole February 21, 2020.[4][5][6]\nIn March 1960, three women, Frances Murphy (47), Mildred Lindquist (50), and Lillian Oetting (50), wives of prominent Chicago businessmen, took a four-day trip to Starved Rock State Park in LaSalle County, Illinois, along the banks of the Illinois River. They arrived from the Chicago suburb of Riverside, about 90 miles northeast of the park.[2][7] On March 14, after checking into the Starved Rock Lodge, the three took an afternoon hike through St. Louis Canyon, but never returned. Their disappearances went unnoticed until March 16 when the husband of Frances Murphy phoned the lodge to inquire about his wife. Police organized a search of the park which led to the discovery of the women's bodies, bound with twine and partially disrobed, inside a cave in the canyon. All three suffered severe head trauma and a blood stained tree limb found nearby was determined to have been used to bludgeon them to death.[2][7][8]\nWeger, a dishwasher at the Starved Rock Lodge, was among those interviewed by Illinois State Police in the aftermath of the discovery. Several employees of the lodge told investigators that he showed to work the day after the women's disappearances with scratches on his face. Weger was questioned extensively in the weeks following the murders and was administered at least three lie detector tests, which he passed. However, investigators continued to pursue him owing to his past brushes with the law. He fit the description of an assailant who bound a teenage girl with twine and raped her at nearby Matthiessen State Park months earlier, and was later identified by the victim in a photo line-up. The twine used to bind the murder victims was the same as that found in the kitchen at the lodge, and he failed a lie detector test given to him in September. Based on this, investigators put him on nonstop surveillance.[2][9][10]\n",

In 1987, he was kidnapped and held for ransom by Danny Edwards and Nancy Rish. The conditions of his confinement caused him to die of asphyxiation. As a result, Edwards was given the death penalty (later commuted) and Rish was sentenced to life in prison without parole.\nSmall was born in 1947 and raised in Kankakee, Illinois. His parents, Burrell and Reva Small, owned and operated a media conglomerate called Mid America Media; the Small family also owned the controlling interest in United Press International; and this is where Small himself worked. His great grandfather was Illinois governor Len Small. Stephen Small had received his education at Lake Forest Academy, the University of Denver and Mark Hopkins College.[2]  In 1969, he married Nancy Pedersen, with whom he had three sons.\nAround 12:30\u00a0a.m. on September 2, 1987, someone claiming to be a Kankakee police officer called the Small home and told Stephen Small that a burglary had occurred at the B. Harley Bradley House, a property that Small owned and was in the process of renovating. Small got dressed and left his home. Around 3:30 that morning someone called the Small residence and told Stephen's wife, Nancy, \"We have your husband.\" Nancy then heard her husband say that he had been handcuffed inside a box underground. Small told his wife to obtain\u2007$1 million in cash. The caller directed Mrs. Small not to report the matter to the police.\nThe matter was reported to the authorities, however, and devices were connected to the Smalls' telephone line to record incoming calls and to determine their origins. At 5:03 that afternoon, the same person called again, asking Mrs. Small how much money had been collected. This call was placed from a telephone located at a Phillips 66 gas station in Aroma Park. Edwards was seen there at that time, in the company of a blonde-haired woman.\nAt 5:40\u00a0p.m., Jean Alice Small, Stephen Small's aunt, telephoned the Small residence to tell them of a call she had just received. Jean said that the caller had told her that he knew that Nancy Small's telephone was tapped. After telling Jean that the victim was buried, the caller threatened to kill Jean's husband. Nancy Small received another telephone call from the kidnapper at 11:28 that night. This call originated from a telephone at a Sunoco station in Aroma Park, where an FBI agent saw a white male at a telephone, and a blonde-haired woman in a car that was later identified as belonging to Nancy Rish, Edwards' girlfriend; Rish had blonde hair. The caller played a tape recording of Stephen Small's voice. On the tape, Stephen provided instructions for delivering the ransom. After audio enhancement, a voice in the background could be heard threatening Small.\n",

        "paragraph": "From 1967 to 1973, an extended period of racial unrest occurred in the town of Cairo, Illinois. The city had long had racial tensions which boiled over after a black soldier was found hanged in his jail cell. Over the next several years, fire bombings, racially charged boycotts and shootouts were common place in Cairo, with 170 nights of gunfire reported in 1969 alone.[1][2]\nThe unrest was a factor in the depopulation of Cairo.\nCairo's turbulent history of race relations is often traced back to the lynching of black resident William James. In 1900, Cairo had a population of nearly 13,000. Of that total, approximately 5,000 residents were African-American. In 1900, this was an unusually high black population for a town of Cairo's size, and five percent of all black residents of the state of Illinois resided here. As a result of the large black population in a town with a traditionally southern white heritage, race relations were already strained by 1900. On the night of November 11, 1909, two men were lynched. The first man lynched was a black man named William James, who was allegedly responsible for the murder of Anna Pelly, a young white woman killed three days earlier. The second man lynched was a white man named Henry Salzner, who had allegedly murdered his wife in the previous August.[3]\n",

As a teenager, he worked as a messenger for the Genna Brothers, a group of ruthless Sicilian gangsters. He earned a full membership in the Genna gang on February 21, 1916 at age 17 by murdering Frank Lombardi outside a saloon. Lombardi was a supporter of incumbent Chicago alderman John Powers, a bitter enemy of the Genna brothers. The brutal warfare between the Gennas and Powers became known in Chicago as the Aldermen's Wars.\nProhibition began in 1920, and Ammatuna had already become one of the Gennas' leading members. The brothers continued to battle the Powers faction for political control of the Nineteenth Ward. The Gennas began bootlegging operations and became one of the main suppliers of homemade alcohol to the Torrio-Capone gang. Ammatuna was the  enforcer who oversaw production of the gang's numerous \"alky cookers\", and he became the personal bodyguard for \"Bloody\" Angelo Genna by the end of 1920.\n",

Despite this, Joseph and his younger brother Joshua were removed from a foster family and returned to Amanda, who killed Joseph with an electrical cord.[1] The circumstances of Wallace's death and the ensuing public outcry precipitated large changes in the Illinois child welfare system and the Cook County juvenile court.[2]\nIn June 1996, Amanda Wallace was convicted of her son's murder. She avoided the death penalty which had been sought by the state of Illinois and was instead sentenced to life imprisonment.[3] Amanda committed suicide by hanging in her prison cell on August 3, 1997.[4]\nJoshua, the only surviving son of Wallace, spent years stuck in the child welfare system. Shortly after Joseph's death Joshua began to display significant emotional and behavioral outbursts, either from witnessing his brother's murder or the continued disruption in his placements.[5] From 1993 to 1995, Joshua lived in the care of Erma and Phillip Lee in Oak Park, Illinois. By May 1995, Joshua was again removed from his only long-term home placement over claims the Lees sought to exploit Joshua for larger state payments.[5] Joshua was adopted by Illinois resident Maria Travis in August 1997. Following his adoption, Joshua's name was legally changed to Joshua Travis. Since 2015, Joshua resides in Park Forest, Illinois.[6]\n",

Areas with histories of violent crime and drug use such as Washington Park and Garfield Park have been common locations for these murders to occur.[5] This pattern was recognized in 2018 through the Murder Accountability Project (MAP), which reviewed over 50 unsolved strangulation and asphyxiation cases dating as far back as 2001.[6] The algorithm used by MAP sorts unsolved homicides by location, victim, and killing method in order to identify clusters associated with low homicide clearance rates.

The historian Amy Louise Wood argues that the cultural power of lynching, and of white supremacy, \"rested on spectacle...which produced and disseminated images of white power and black degradation, of white unity and black criminality, that served to instill and perpetuate a sense of racial supremacy in their white spectators.\"[3] An effervescence of lynchings occurred throughout the United States from the Civil War through the 1940s.[3] In 1919, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) published a report on incidents of lynchings in the United States.[2] The NAACP report found that 114 \"colored\" persons were lynched in 1893; down from 155 lynchings the previous year (1892), though still one of the highest years of reported lynchings on record.[2]\n",

A prominent and well-known settler in the Iowa Territory, he was one of the earliest settlers in Rock Island.

During the next several years, he visited ports in the Baltic as well as in France, Spain, and Portugal. In the fall of 1803, shortly after arriving with a cargo from Liverpool, Davenport was arrested with the rest of his crew while in port at St. Petersburg when the Czarist Russian government acceded to Napoleon's embargo on British vessels (the \"Continental System\"). Davenport was imprisoned until the spring when he was released and allowed to return to his home country.[2]\nDavenport arrived in New York the following summer.  While in port, he suffered a severe leg injury during the rescue of a fellow sailor who had fallen overboard.

Wilson practiced at Cole Park[9] in Chatham and participated in summer league games in Chicago.[10] As his game developed, friends and family surrounding Wilson began to notice that his talent could make him one of the best players in the sport. They made it a point to protect Wilson from trouble as he got older; as he was entering high school, the nationwide crack epidemic was in full swing and some of the people closest to Wilson, including his older brother Curtis, became addicted. Chicago's violent crime rate was very high during this time as well, especially on the South Side.\n",

He was apprehended by a mob of farmers and hanged.\nWilliam Johnson was an African American man who lived in a work camp for erecting the Thebes Bridge in Thebes, Illinois, over the Mississippi River. In late April 1903, Johnson was accused of assaulting the 10-year-old daughter of Branson Davis at his residence a half-mile east of Santa Fe, Illinois (modern day Fayville). A mob of farmers gathered to apprehend Johnson on April 26, but he had already been taken into police custody. The farmers overwhelmed the officers and Johnson was captured. They brought him back to Thebes near the bridge that was being constructed and hanged him from an oak tree. After Johnston expired, the mob shot up the body. The mob then attacked the work camp, exchanging fire and injuring several workers. The farmers then burned the camp and then dispersed. On May 1, the mob raided another work camp on May 1 and dispersed the black workers there.[1]\nIllinois governor Richard Yates offered a $200 bounty for the arrest of those who committed the lynching.[2] Six men were arrested, however, they were released due to insufficient evidence.[3]\n",

Lee Epplen of the Chicago Police stated that Stachowicz and Gutierrez got into an argument after the woman harangued him about his sexuality, calling him and his roommate derogatory names, police and prosecutors said. Gutierrez told police he became enraged after Stachowicz kept questioning him, said Cook County Assistant State's Atty. Nancy Galassini during a bond hearing. Gutierrez claimed that she proceeded to ask him \"Why do you sleep with boys?\", after which he became even more angry and Nancy Galassini said \"The defendant punched and kicked and stabbed the victim until he was tired. He then placed a plastic garbage bag over her head and strangled her.\" He then continued to rape her.\nGutierrez later concealed her body in a crawlspace under the floor. Prosecutors also accused Gutierrez of sexually assaulting Stachowicz, a charge that was denied by his defense attorney.[3] In a confession videotaped by the Chicago Police, Gutierrez said he panicked because Stachowicz's trying to get him to change his sexuality reminded him of his mother. \"She had this sneer, which reminded me of my mother when she used to beat me...I saw nothing but red,\" Gutierrez was reported saying in the Chicago Sun-Times.[4] Later his defense attorney, Crystal Marchigiani, said that it was Gutierrez who had been physically attacked by Stachowicz, and that, \"She could not leave him alone.\"[3] Gutierrez was sentenced to life in prison on July 2, 2007.[5] His defense attorney asked the judge to account for his childhood history of physical abuse, but Stachowicz' son was 100% convinced that Gutierrez should receive the death penalty.[5]\n",

He served as professor of the history of religions at the University of Chicago from 1988 to his death, and had previously taught the history of Romanian culture at the University of Groningen.\nAn expert in Gnosticism and Renaissance magic, he was encouraged and befriended by Mircea Eliade, though he gradually distanced himself from his mentor. Culianu published seminal work on the interrelation of the occult, Eros, magic, physics, and history.[1]\nCulianu was murdered in 1991. It has been much speculated his murder was in consequence of his critical view of Romanian national politics.[2] Some factions of the Romanian political right openly celebrated his murder.[1] The Romanian Securitate, which he once lambasted as a force \"of epochal stupidity\", has also been suspected of involvement and of using puppet fronts on the right as cover.[2]\n",

Old Smokey was the nickname of the electric chairs used in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.[1] \"Old Sparky\" is sometimes used to refer to electric chairs in general, and not one of a specific state.\nConnecticut legislated lethal injection as its sole method of execution in 1995.[2] The last person executed by electrocution was Joseph \"Mad Dog\" Taborsky in May 1960.[3] Connecticut's \"Old Sparky\" has not been tested since it was moved from Wethersfield to the Northern Correctional Institution in Somers in 1962, and prison officials claim the prison's electrical system cannot handle it.[4]\nThe electric chair was the sole means of execution in Florida from 1924 until 2000, when the Florida State Legislature, under pressure from the U.S. Supreme Court, signed lethal injection into law. Although no one has been executed in this manner since 1999, prisoners awaiting execution on Florida's death row may still be electrocuted at their request.

Reportedly, 6-inch flames shot out of Tafero's head and 12-inch flames shot out of Medina's head, raising the question whether use of the electric chair was \"cruel and unusual punishment\". After the Medina execution, Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth commented, \"People who wish to commit murder, they'd better not do it in the state of Florida because we may have a problem with the electric chair.\"[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Spring Valley race riot of 1895 was a violent racial conflict between Eastern and Southern European immigrants and African American coal workers in the mining town of Spring Valley, Illinois. The conflict was in response to the robbery and shooting of Italian miner Barney Rollo, who reported that his assailants were five black men. The assault provoked the town's long-standing social and racial unrest, and many white immigrant workers united against the African American miners. During the investigation into the shooting several black miners were temporarily taken into custody for questioning and many white townspeople began to form a mob, demanding that all blacks be fired and removed from Spring Valley. The mine manager refused, which prompted the white miners to violently riot against both the black miners and their families, forcing them to flee to the nearby town of Princeton.\nIn the late 1840s, Illinois banned slavery in its state constitution. During this time enslaved people who had escaped from the Southern United States settled in Illinois, forming freedmen communities. Census data reflects that 5,436 free African Americans lived in Illinois in 1850, mostly in counties near the Southern border like Madison, St. Clair, and Sangamon.[1] Many white Illinoisans disliked the increasing free black population, which culminated in the 1853 promotion and passing of the Illinois Black Code, a bill that barred black people from migrating to or living in Illinois for over ten days, by Congress Democrat John A. Logan.[2] Despite the law, the population of free African Americans grew by nearly 71% in a decade, and by 1860, there were 7,628 freedmen in Illinois.[3] After the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amendment ultimately repealed the Black Code.[4] Social relations between the two groups remained tense, as \"most people of Illinois hated the very sight of a colored person.\"[2]\nHistorian Felix Armfield has stated that the state's racial tension meant that it would \"remain ripe for race wars,\" especially along the lines of labor in coal mining towns.[5] As black workers were typically brought into mining communities as strikebreakers, white and immigrant workers could not reclaim their jobs easily, resulting in labor unrest and sometimes violent, fatal outbursts. St. Clair County was the site of one of the first instances of unrest in February 1874.[5] Similarly, in April 1877, the coal town of Braidwood, Illinois, became the site of conflict along racial lines, along with Rapids City in January 1880 and Vermillion County in July 1886.[5] These conflicts largely coincided with the end of Reconstruction and the beginning of the nadir of American race relations, which was largely defined by violence against African Americans.\n",

Originally from Palermo, Sicily, Di Giorgio lived most of his life as a grocer in New Orleans, where he was also an active Black Hander. While he lived in Los Angeles, he was known as a wealthy food importer. He survived two shootings, only to be killed while visiting Chicago in 1922.\nBorn to Filippo Di Giorgio and Giuseppa Casabianca in Borgetto, Sicily, in 1880,[1] Di Giorgio came to the United States around 1904. After a brief stay in New York City with his reported cousin, he moved to New Orleans. There, he married Maria Cristoforo on April 23, 1909, and joined the community of organized criminals. He was acknowledged as a cousin and a friend to New York City Mafia boss Giuseppe Morello, and with this connection became a leading Black Hander. It is not known when he joined the Honored Society; he may have been a member in Sicily. Using the alias of Joseph Caronia, he was arrested in 1908 for extortion. He was the leader of a Black Hand group that sent an extortion letter demanding money from a leading Italian grocer. He signed the letter \"King of the Mafia.\" He and his associates were freed after a short stay in jail due to lack of evidence. Further investigation showed that Di Giorgio killed a man, Joseph Campisciano, in self-defense about a year earlier. He had used the name Caronia at that time too.\nIn 1914 he became the owner of a grocery and saloon that was sold to him by the brother of the original proprietor. It had been a successful business and the press did not understand why the owner would sell it. It is likely that the owner, Henry Sciambra, was forced to sell. Sciambra's brother Anthony, the original owner, was murdered in 1912 by an intruder while he was in his home sleeping.\n",

        "paragraph": "The Cicero race riot of 1951 occurred July 11\u201312, when a mob of 4,000 whites attacked an apartment building that housed a single black family in a neighborhood in Cicero, Illinois.\nThe aftermath of World War II saw a revival of white attacks on blacks in the Chicago area, mostly on the city's South and Southwest Sides, but also in the western industrial suburb of Cicero. Aspiring African-American professionals seeking to obtain improved housing beyond the increasingly overcrowded South Side ghetto, whether in private residences or in the new public housing developments constructed by the Chicago Housing Authority, were frequently greeted by attempted arsons, bombings, and angry white mobs often numbering into the thousands.[1]\nIn early June 1951, Mrs. DeRose, who owned an apartment building at 6139\u201343 W. 19th Street in Cicero, got into a controversy with her tenants and was ordered to refund a portion of the rent. Afterwards, out of anger and/or profit, she rented an apartment to Harvey E. Clark Jr., an African-American World War II veteran and graduate of Fisk University, and his family in an all-white neighborhood. A high-ranking Cicero official learned that an African-American family was moving into a Cicero apartment and warned Mrs. DeRose that there would be \"trouble\" if he moved in. At 2:30 pm, on June 8, a moving van containing $2,000 worth of Clark's furniture was stopped by the police. The rental agent was ushered out with a drawn revolver at his back. A jeering crowd gathered and Clark was told by the police to get out or he would be arrested \"for protective custody.\" A detective warned Clark that, \"I'll bust your damned head if you don't move.\" At 6:00 pm, Clark was grabbed by 20 police officers. The chief of police told him, \"Get out of here fast. There will be no moving into this building.\" Clark was hit eight times as he was pushed towards a car which was parked across the street and was shoved inside the car. The police told him, \"Get out of Cicero and don't come back in town or you'll get a bullet through you.\". A suit was filed by the NAACP against the Cicero Police Department on June 26, and the Clark family moved in.[2]\n",

Illinois (1968) doctrine, the Rehnquist Court considered challenges to the selection of jurors who would automatically vote to impose the death penalty on a defendant convicted of a capital offense. In a 6\u20133 decision, Justice White wrote for the majority that a defendant facing the death penalty may challenge for cause a prospective juror who would automatically vote to impose the death penalty in every case. Just as a juror who is unalterably opposed to the imposition of the death penalty must be excluded because he or she cannot conscientiously fulfill the oath to follow the law and the instructions to the jury pursuant thereto, so should one who would automatically vote to impose the death penalty be excluded for the same reason. Such a juror, he emphasized, would lack the qualities of impartiality and indifference required by due process. Furthermore, Justice White noted, jurors who would automatically vote to impose the death penalty would not \"in good faith ... consider evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances\" as may be required by law and included in jury instructions.[1]\n",

He was convicted in 2002 of the 1995 murder of his wife Donnah Winger, an operating room technician, and Roger Harrington (born 1967). Winger had married Donnah Winger (n\u00e9e Brown, born 1963) in 1989.[1]\nOn August 23, 1995, Donnah Winger was driven from St. Louis International Airport to her home in Springfield by shuttle driver Roger Harrington. The Wingers later complained to Harrington's employer, saying that Harrington gave Donnah a \"hard time\" during the ride by talking about getting high and having orgies. Six days later, Mark Winger called 911, saying that he had shot Harrington to death after Harrington attacked Donnah with a hammer in their home. The police initially believed that Harrington had broken into the Wingers' home and attacked Donnah in retaliation for their complaint to Harrington's employer.  However, investigators later became suspicious of Winger because he continued to ask about the case even after it had been initially closed.[2] \"He kept coming in. I kept feeling like he was trying to find out if we were checking into anything,\" said a detective. Winger's remarriage to his young daughter's new nanny, hired five months after Donnah died, increased suspicion. Winger eventually had three children with his new wife.\nFour years after Donnah's death, her best friend, DeAnn Shultz, came forward and told police that she and Winger had been involved in an affair at the time of Donnah's death. Winger had ended the affair soon after Donnah's death, and Shultz suspected that he had killed Donnah. On reexamination of the evidence, police concluded that the positions of Donnah's and Harrington's bodies were inconsistent with Winger's account of a struggle with Harrington. They also found evidence in Harrington's car that Mark Winger had invited Harrington to the Winger home. The new theory was that Donnah's upsetting ride with Harrington inspired Winger to plan to kill her with the hammer and then to shoot Harrington, using the fabricated story of an attack by Harrington as a cover. He was charged with murder in 2001.\n",

        "paragraph": "The Charleston riot occurred on March 28, 1864, in Charleston, Illinois, after Union soldiers and local Republicans clashed with local insurgent Democrats known as Copperheads. By the time the riot had subsided, nine were dead and twelve had been wounded.  It is generally thought that one of the events that triggered the riot was the treatment of Judge Charles H. Constable by Union soldiers.  The soldiers humiliated Constable by making him swear allegiance to the federal government, due to his decision to allow four Union deserters to go free in Marshall, Illinois. When the riot began, Judge Constable was holding court in Charleston.[1]\nThe news coverage of the event stated that the Peace Democrats were responsible for beginning the event. One such news source, from the Chicago Tribune, later reprinted in the Charleston Courier, labeled Nelson Wells as the instigator of the conflict. Most articles published from the time, insist that the whole event transpired as a more spontaneous event and was not directly prompted by any one individual. The most likely explanation is that the event occurred because a sizable presence of both Copperheads and Union soldiers had been in town that day. Also many sources speculate that a sizable portion of the participants, at least on the side of the Peace Democrats, had been drinking quite heavily all day, and this led to the outbreak that resulted in the confrontation. At any rate, the fighting only lasted a few moments. But by the time the affair was over, the Copperheads had been run out of Charleston. Rewards had been issued for the capture of any of those whom fled the scene. Included in those who left town, was John O\u2019Hair, the leader of the Copperheads, who had been the sheriff of Coles County. Out of those killed, only two had been Copperheads, Nelson Wells and John Cooper; the other participants had been either captured or escaped. Other Union troops were called in from Mattoon to assist the soldiers fighting in Charleston, but by the time their train arrived, none of the instigators were left in the town. Fifteen prisoners were eventually held for seven months, initially in Springfield, Illinois. President Lincoln, whose father and stepmother had lived in Coles County, waived the prisoners' right to Habeas Corpus and ordered their removal to Fort Delaware in the East. He ordered their release on November 4, 1864. Two of the prisoners had been indicted for murder and were exonerated by trial in December, 1864. Twelve other Copperheads had also been indicted for murder. They were never captured, and the indictments were annulled in May 1873.\nThe terms Copperheads and Butternuts were used to describe the larger movement, which has been known as Peace Democrats. This political affiliation which stirred up support, as David Montgomery points out in Beyond Equality: Labor and the Radical Republicans, by incorporating the fears that the federal government's war effort sought to usurp the constitution. The copperheads incorporated a racial component to their disdain for the Republican war effort, as Montgomery points out, that emancipated Negroes would flood the North, because of the Emancipation Proclamation. Using racially charged rhetoric, Copperheads sought to unite opposition to the Radical Republicans. This had become a national phenomenon during the American Civil War. Democrat sympathizers were battling to keep their country from becoming, in their eyes, too radical.\n",

Jimerson and Williams were sentenced to death, Adams to 75 years in jail and Rainge to life. Following the murder in 1978, the four spent almost two decades in prison before being released in 1996. This miscarriage of justice was due to false forensic testimony, coercion of a prosecution witness, perjury by another witness who had an incentive to lie, and prosecution and police misconduct. The DNA evidence uncovered in the investigation to clear their names eventually led to the arrest and conviction of the real killers.\nOn May 11, 1978, 28-year-old Lawrence Lionberg (who was working a night shift at a Homewood, Illinois, gas station) and his 23-year-old fianc\u00e9 Carol Schmal were kidnapped.  Schmal was raped several times and both were shot in the back of the head.[4]  There was a public outcry at the brutal murder.\nThe four suspects were tried in 1978. A witness, Charles McCraney, claimed to have seen  Williams, Rainge and Adams near the crime scene area in Ford Heights (at the time called East Chicago Heights) at the time of the crime. A state expert witness, Michael Podlecki, said that at least one of the rapists was type A secretor blood (shared by 25% of the population) and Williams and Adams had Type A secretor blood (an independent forensic witness found in 1987 that Williams and Adams actually had non-secretor blood). Podlecki also claimed that hairs from the back of Williams car were consistent with Lionberg and Schmal.[2] No other physical evidence matched the suspects to the crime. A convict, David Jackson, testified that he had overheard Williams and Rainge in jail discussing the murder and rape (Jackson later admitted he had fabricated this evidence because he was offered a deal by the authorities). The prosecution eliminated all black jurors from the trial (the defendants were all black and the murder victims were white).  The police did not inform the defense that a witness, Marvin Simpson, heard shots and identified four men running from the murder scene - Arthur Robinson, Juan Rodriguez, Ira and Dennis Johnson (these four were later found to be the real killers). Family members of the Ford Four testified they were elsewhere at the time of the murder.  The defendants' lawyer, Archie B. Weston, was ineffective, and was the subject of a legal disciplinary hearing at the time and was later disbarred from being a lawyer for another offense.  A witness, Paula Gray, (with an IQ of 55[5]), testified to prosecutors that she had seen the defendants shoot the victims and rape Schmal. However, she withdrew her evidence before the court case and prosecutors charged her with murder and perjury.  Williams was sentenced to death, while Adams was sentenced to 75 years, Rainge to life, and Paula Gray to 50 years in 1978. Jimerson could not be charged as McCraney had not mentioned Jimerson in his testimony and Paula Gray had withdrawn her testimony.[6]\n",

McDonald was a 17-year-old who was fatally shot by a Chicago Police Officer, Jason Van Dyke.[3][4] Police had initially reported that McDonald was behaving erratically while walking down the street, refusing to put down a knife, and that he had lunged at officers. Preliminary internal police reports described the incident similarly, leading to the shooting being judged as justifiable, and Van Dyke not being charged at the time.[5] This was later disproved after a video of the encounter was released, showing that McDonald was walking away.\nOn November 24, 2015, thirteen months after the shooting, a court ordered the police to release a dash cam video of the shooting. It showed that McDonald was walking away from the police when he was shot 16 times by Officer Van Dyke. That same day, Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder, and was initially held without bail at the Cook County Jail.[6] He was released on bail on November 30.[7] The city reached a settlement with McDonald's family for $5 million in April 2015. On October 5, 2018, Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder, as well as 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm.[8]\n",

Jones gained a certain notoriety in 1993, after being convicted of second-degree murder for the killing of another blues musician, Boston Blackie.\nJones, a disciple of Howlin' Wolf, was given his nickname by his hero because of his habit of regularly arriving late at Howlin' Wolf performances.\nJones was born in Altheimer, Arkansas.[1][2] He was raised by his grandparents after his parents separated when he was a baby.[3] He first heard blues music as a child.[2] He secretly listened to music on his family's battery-powered radio, which caused some consternation when the batteries were too low for his family to listen to gospel music before church each Sunday.[3] During those formative years he saw both Sonny Boy Williamson II and Boyd Gilmore perform at a little club named Jack Rabbitts in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.[4][5] After relocating to Chicago in 1966, Jones worked as an auto mechanic. He began to perform locally but got lucky when his musical hero, Howlin' Wolf, allowed Jones to sit in with him at concerts. This influence, and the raw, gritty approach he had admired in the musical stylings of Sonny Boy Williamson, Muddy Waters, and Willie Dixon, made Jones concentrate on a \"low-down\" style of Chicago blues.[2][4]  Originally he was known as Crawlin' James, a nickname he acquired from his habit of crawling around on stage whilst performing. Later on, Howlin' Wolf named him Tail Dragger because Jones often arrived late for gigs.[2] By the early 1970s, Jones had become a full-time singer and he utilised notable backing musicians, including Willie Kent, Hubert Sumlin, Carey Bell, Kansas City Red,[5] Little Mack Simmons, Big Leon Brooks, and Eddie Shaw.[2]\n",

The courthouse joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration.

Area residents viewed this as one of several attempts by the CHA to initiate racial integration into white communities.[1] The riot took place between 98th and 111th streets and lasted for three days, from the day veterans and their families moved into the project, August 13th, 1947 to August 16th, 1947. The Chicago Police Department did little to stop the rioting, as was the case a year before at the Airport Homes race riots.[2] It was one of the worst race riots in Chicago history. \nHousing projects in Chicago emerged during the 1940s with the sole purpose of resolving the shortage of affordable homes for war-industry workers, many who were African American, as America prepared for World War II.[2] As Chicago proved to be a crucial steel production center for the war effort, hundreds of thousands of black workers and their families migrated from the South to Chicago in the second wave of the Great Migration.[2] Historian Devereux Bowly iterates some alarming statistics about public housing in Chicago that arose from 1940 census data: 1) 55,157 housing units were overcrowded (exceeding 1.5 persons per room), and 2) 206,103 housing units either had no access to a private bathroom or needed major repairs to interior structures.[2] To answer to such dismal conditions, the CHA opened four housing projects in low income areas with high concentrations of war-industry workers: the Frances Cabrini Homes in August 1942, the Lawndale Gardens in December 1942, the Bridgeport Homes in May 1943, and the Robert H. Brooks Homes in March 1943.[3] For families to live in these new projects, they needed to have at least one child; the family had to have one member working in a critical war industry (like steel); the family income had to total less than $2,000; and it was preferred that the family's nationality was American.[4]\nAdditional housing projects for war workers led by the National Housing Agency and the Federal Public Housing Authority on the far South Side included the Altgeld Gardens project, which was constructed on a 157-acre vacant land tract in November 1943.[5] Unlike the above projects, Altgeld Gardens contained row houses and backyards rather than crowded multi-story apartments.[6] Similarly, the West Chesterfield project homes were commissioned by the CHA and built in December 1943.[7] A unique project, the housing units (actual homes) are built on full city lots, and following construction, the CHA required a minimum annual income as to promote eventual homeownership for residents.[8] While each of the projects identified presented reasonable options for war workers and their families, the end of the war would present different challenges, especially along the lines of integration.\n",

Using his position as head of the movie production workers' union, Bioff helped Chicago Outfit boss Frank Nitti successfully extort millions of dollars from Hollywood film studios by using the threat of a general strike that would paralyze the American film industry.[1][2]\nBioff was born and briefly raised in a kosher Jewish household in Chicago, but his father kicked him out on the street when he was eight years old.[1] Bioff soon became involved in criminal ventures, beginning with petty theft, then minor protection rackets and working his way up to pimping in Chicago's Levee vice district, of which he was later convicted in 1922. Bioff later worked for Harry and Jake \"Greasy Thumb\" Guzik where, through Guzik, Bioff met Al Capone and later Frank \"The Enforcer\" Nitti.[citation needed]\nIn the 1930s, Nitti sent Bioff to California as an enforcer for Mafia-controlled union leader George Browne, who later became President of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. Bioff, aided by John \"Handsome Johnny\" Rosselli, eventually became the collector for the Syndicate-controlled unions in Hollywood, extorting millions of dollars from major motion-picture studios, and keeping several hundred thousand for himself.

B. Hutto, Sunnyland Slim, Lacy Gibson, and Little Walter. AllMusic noted that \"the playing style of Jackson is vastly influential\".[1]\nJackson was fatally shot during a family argument in 1979.\nHe was born in Gill, Lee County, Arkansas, United States.[3][4] In his youth, Jackson was influenced by his uncle Alf Bonner and aunt Cora, who led their own jug band.  The couple also ran a roadside cafe situated between Helena, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee, which regularly played host to blues musicians from neighbouring States. Jackson joined the Bonner's Jug Band and performed with them for a number of years.  He thereafter branched out on his own as a traveling musician, playing in Memphis, then across Florida, in St. Louis, Missouri, before finally, in around 1950, coming to a halt in Chicago, Illinois. The French music historian, G\u00e9rard Herzhaft, later commented that \"The guitar style of Lee Jackson, sharp, jazzy, with sparse but brilliant and bluesy notes was quite original for the immediate post-war Chicago blues scene, reflecting his years playing with swinging jug bands\".[5]\n",

In 1942, Robinson began playing in the Maxwell Street market, where he also performed with local musicians.[2] In 1948, Robinson met Eddie Taylor, and the two worked the Chicago club scene together until 1952.[3] After the two split, Robinson formed a band, the Every Hour Blues Boys, with Freddie King, whom he met outside a welfare center.[2] The band lasted four years, and King later credited Robinson as one of his earliest and most influential teachers. In 1955, Robinson joined a band led by Little Walter, which became popular in Chicago. In 1958, Walter was incapacitated by a shooting, and Robinson became the vocalist of the group in Walter's absence, but he left the band later that year, because of personnel issues.[4] Throughout the 1950s, Robinson was in demand as a session musician, playing bass guitar and rhythm guitar for such artists as Howlin' Wolf, and Magic Sam.[2] In addition to his session work, he recorded three singles for the Bandera label, including one of his signature songs, \"All of My Life\", in 1960.[5]\n",

Federal agents managed to trace him and his wife to a Chicago hideout used by the Barkers and raided the apartment building on January 8, 1935. The raid was bungled from the start as the FBI set off tear gas in the wrong apartment causing a panic among the tenants. When local police officers arrived on the scene, they nearly opened fire on federal agents who they believed were gangsters.

The neighbors were disturbed by the presence of the attending black shop stewards and insisted they leave the area, and when Bindman refused this request two days of rioting began.  Although one hundred policeman were on the scene, the crowd almost destroyed Bindman's home.  This is a very interesting and perhaps overlooked flash point in the history of the civil rights movement because it marks a place where the struggles of labor moved beyond the plants and into the larger community where it joined forces with other activist organizations.  Indeed the UPWA quickly emerged at the forefront of community wide mobilization.

He then moved to Missouri, where he subsequently murdered his wife and two men in 1889 and 1890, respectively. He was convicted of the latter murders, sentenced to death again and executed in 1891.[1]\nWilliamson was born in Mackinaw Township, Illinois on April 23, 1831, one of five children to wealthy farmer Reuben W. Williamson.[2] According to Thomas, his father was a harsh man who demanded hard work from his son from an early age. At the age of 10, he began to steal, committing numerous thefts around Tazewell County, and spending a majority of his evenings in Oakdale, where he was known as a miscreant.[2] At age 13, he attempted to rob a store in Pekin, but was caught and sent to the local penitentiary, but released after being found not guilty at a trial several weeks later.[2] At age 22, he was struck down with an illness, which caused him to be paralysed on one side.[3]\nAfter spending a majority of the following years bouncing between working for his father and uncle, Thomas was jailed for horse stealing in Centralia, where he spent a week. Upon his release, he decided to join the Union Army, thinking that the military life might do him good. He enlisted in the 7th Illinois Infantry Regiment, spending most of his time in Bald Knob.[2] After being honorably discharged, he returned to Mackinaw Township, worked at various odd jobs and made considerable profit. Williamson would eventually enlist in the 108th Illinois Infantry Regiment, who were dispatched to Tennessee. During his time, he resumed his thefts, stealing small items from fellow soldiers like pocket watches. According to Thomas' account, he fought in the Siege of Vicksburg, Siege of Corinth, the battle at Red River, the Battle of Gettysburg, the Battle of Lookout Mountain and numerous others. After the war ended, he returned to Illinois.[2]\n",

Moore was a prolific writer, authoring numerous articles, books, essays, pamphlets on topics including animal rights, education, ethics, evolutionary biology, humanitarianism, socialism, temperance, utilitarianism and vegetarianism. He also lectured on many of these subjects and was widely regarded as a talented orator, earning the name the \"silver tongue of Kansas\" for his lectures on prohibition.\nMoore was born near Rockville, Indiana, in 1862 and spent his formative years in Linden, Missouri. Raised as a Christian, this instilled in him the anthropocentric belief that non-human animals existed for the benefit of humans. At college, Moore was introduced to Darwin's theory of evolution, which led him to develop an ethic that rejected both Christianity and anthropocentrism, and recognized the intrinsic value of animals; he adopted vegetarianism as an extension of this belief. While studying zoology at the University of Chicago, he became a socialist, helped form the university's Vegetarian Eating Club and won a national oratorical contest on prohibition. Moore was an influential member of the Chicago Vegetarian Society and attempted to model the organization as an American version of the Humanitarian League, a British organization that Moore was also a member of. In 1895, Moore delivered a speech that was published by the Chicago Vegetarian Society as Why I Am a Vegetarian.

The Puerto Rican population moved from the Near West Side and the Near North Side to West Town and Humboldt Park, areas of white working-class neighborhoods, populated by European immigrants and their children. New Puerto Rican arrivals joined the new Puerto Rican enclaves in West Town and Humboldt Park.[6] By 1960, 25% of the city's Puerto Rican population lived in West Town.[7] Most Puerto Ricans faced racial tensions with their white neighbors and especially with white authorities.

He worked as an agent for William Burnett, also of Canada, to sell to the Native Americans and take furs in exchange. He was among the first European permanent settlers in Chicago. He was killed there in 1812, in what was called the \"first murder in Chicago\", by John Kinzie, a trading partner of Burnett who was another early settler from Canada.\nDuring the time of the American Revolutionary War, France joined the cause of the Americans against the British. Because of this, in their Canadian territories, the British treated those of French heritage more harshly. Several families, the first two being the families of Jean La Lime and Antoinne Ouillemette, fled to the Eschikagou (Chicago) area to escape the harsh treatment.[1] After trading along the frontier and likely in Detroit, La Lime arrived in the Chicago area on August 17, 1792 as an agent for William Burnett of Canada. In 1800, he purchased the homestead of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable for Burnett for 6,000 livres.[2] The bill of sale was filed in Detroit, Michigan on September 18, 1800, although dated in Chicago on May 7 of that year.[3]\nBy 1804, Burnett's partner, John Kinzie, who also settled in Chicago, had bought the former du Sable house. He lived there with his wife and first child. They had three other children born in Chicago.\n",

Meetings of working men in Chicago on July 26 led to workers from a number of industries striking on the following morning, and over the next few days, large crowds gathered throughout the city, resulting in violent clashes with police. By the time order was restored on the evening of July 26, 14 to 30 rioters were dead or dying, and 35 to 100 civilian and nine to 13 policemen were wounded.\nThe Long Depression, sparked in the United States by the Panic of 1873, had far-reaching implications for US industry, closing more than a hundred railroads in the first year and cutting construction of new rail lines from 7,500 miles (12,100\u00a0km) of track in 1872 to 1,600 miles (2,600\u00a0km) in 1875.[4] Approximately 18,000 businesses failed between 1873 and 1875, production in iron and steel dropped as much as 45 percent, and a million or more lost their jobs.[5][6] In 1876, 76 railroad companies went bankrupt or entered receivership in the US alone, and the economic impacts rippled throughout many economic sectors throughout the industrialized world.[7]:\u200a31\u200a\n",

Though bands of roving criminals were common in many parts of Illinois, the counties of Lee, DeKalb, Ogle, and Winnebago were especially plagued by them.[1] The new crime wave in the region of the frontier Midwest may have occurred following the crackdown on Southern outlaws by the rising vigilante-regulator movement and the breakup of the criminal syndicate of John A. Murrell  and his gang, the \"Mystic Clan\" in the Southern United States. In 1841, the escalating pattern of house burglary, horse and cattle theft, stagecoach and highway robbery, counterfeiting, and murder associated with the Banditti had come to a head in Ogle County. As the crimes continued, local citizens formed bands of vigilantes known as Regulators. A clash between the Banditti and the Regulators in Ogle County near Oregon, Illinois, resulted in the outlaws' demise and decreased Banditti activity and violent crime within the county.\nBanditti and Regulator activity continued well after the lynching that took place in 1841. Crimes continued, committed by both sides, across northern and central Illinois. The Banditti were involved in other notable events, as well, including the 1845 torture-murder of merchant Colonel George Davenport, the namesake of Davenport, Iowa. Edward Bonney, an amateur detective who hunted down and brought to justice the killers, wrote of his exploits and alibi, which were recounted in his book, Banditti of the Prairies, or the Murderer's Doom!!: A Tale of the Mississippi Valley, published in Chicago in 1850.  The outlaw gangs also continued to be active in Lee and Winnebago Counties following the events in Oregon.\n",

Stokes was 48 years old.[15][16]\nWillie Stokes garnered international notoriety for the arrangements he made for his son Willie the Wimp's funeral.[14] The younger Stokes followed his father's example trafficking narcotics and rivaled his dad's appetite for gambling.

Carter said, \"I said to Ruth, 'This isn't a column\u2014it's a song'.\" They drove to the studio, and Carter said that \"in the two miles it took us to get there we put the column to music.\" Jimmie Vaughan was at the studio, and he called his brother, Stevie Ray Vaughan, to tell him about it.[18] Stevie liked the song, recorded it, and performed it live for his fans around the world. Much of the song's lyrics came directly out of the column including a quote from Willie the Wimp's mother where she described her and her husband's reason for wanting an extravagant funeral for their son. She said that her son \"left like he lived\u2014in a lively manner.\"[18] It was worked into a verse in the song that says, \"In his Cadillac to heaven he was waving that banner; He left like he lived, in a lively manner.\"\n",

Depicted with racist imagery in the mainstream press after his arrest, he was given the nickname the \"Brick Moron\" as he killed his victims with bricks and was depicted as dimwitted.\nConvicted of murder, he was executed in Chicago in 1939. Nixon served, in part,[3] as the basis of the character of Bigger Thomas in Richard Wright's 1940 social protest novel Native Son.\nOn April 4, 1937, Edna A. Worden (age 48) and her 12-year-old daughter, Marguerite Estelle, a junior high school student, were murdered in their apartment in the neighborhood of Bunker Hill, Los Angeles. Their bodies were discovered on Sunday, April 5, 1937, by the manager of their building, the Astoria Apartments, which was located next to the Angel's Flight stairs. Worden and her daughter were sexually assaulted and murdered with a brick that still had mortar attached to it. Los Angeles detectives linked the crime to the rape-murder of 20-year-old Rose Valdez, a young mother who was killed on March 2 as her baby slept in the same room in its crib.\n",

The hotel was located on the Wabash River next to the Grand Rapids Dam on land that was originally purchased by Thomas S. Hinde.[1]  Before the hotel was built, the property where the hotel was located was a site of a former homestead, and was used by Frederick Hinde Zimmerman for multiple small shops that sold goods to fisherman and tourists.\nFrederick Hinde Zimmerman was the founder and owner of the hotel, and he completed construction and opened the hotel to the public on August 7, 1922. The hotel had 36 rooms and one large assembly room that served as a dining room, meeting hall, and was used for weddings, exhibitions, anniversaries, and other important occasions. The hotel was one of the first major resorts on the southern portion of the Wabash River and quickly was able to attract tourist from across the country because of its location on the river and ease of access provided by the railroad. During its nine-year existence the hotel established a reputation for luxury and high quality.\nIn later years, after manager Glenn Goodart took over operation of the hotel, it gradually began to lose patronage due to incompetent business planning and flooding of the Wabash River in the summers of 1927, 1928, and 1929. On July 29, 1929, Glenn Goodart burned the Grand Rapids Hotel to the ground by dropping a blowtorch in the basement shop.  Three months before Goodart burned the hotel down, the United States Senate Committee on Commerce had decided to remove the Grand Rapids Dam by revoking funding. Due to the onset of the Great Depression shortly after the hotel was burned down, it was not rebuilt. The same year Goodart burned the hotel down he was elected as Finance Commissioner for Wabash County, Illinois.\n",

With the Great Migration, thousands of African Americans from the American South had settled next to neighborhoods of European immigrants on Chicago's South Side near jobs in the stockyards, meatpacking plants, and industry. Meanwhile, the long-established Irish fiercely defended their neighborhoods and political power against all newcomers.[7][8] Post-World War I racism and social tensions built up in the competitive labor and housing markets.[9] Overcrowding and increased African American resistance against racism, especially by war veterans, contributed to the racial tension,[5] as well as white ethnic gangs unrestrained by police.[9]\n",

These riots are remembered as a turning point in Puerto Rican civic involvement in Chicago.[1][2] This was the first riot in the United States attributed to Puerto Ricans.[3]\nPuerto Rican migration to Chicago peaked in the 1950s and 60s, and the Puerto Rican population of Chicago jumped from 255 in 1950 to 32,371 in 1960.[4] Puerto Ricans in Chicago worked low-paying jobs in the service industries or labored in factories. This was in part because of the recruitment efforts of Castle, Barton and Associates, an employment agency. They offered domestic and foundry work contracts, and paid the airfare for Puerto Ricans coming to Chicago.[5] Another factor behind Puerto Rican migration to Chicago was the unemployment and harsh economic conditions created by Operation Bootstrap.[5]\nSome of the new Puerto Rican arrivals settled in Chicago's north side, specifically in Lincoln Park. But by the late 1960s, gentrification took hold in Lincoln Park, and working class Puerto Ricans were displaced by high property taxes and expensive housing.[5] Around the city, some Puerto Ricans faced housing discrimination based on their skin color and ethnicity. Many moved west, settling near Division Street in West Town, Bucktown, and Wicker Park.[6] The Chicago Catholic Church did not offer the Puerto Rican community their own parish, so devout Puerto Ricans had to try to attend existing parishes. In the 1950s and 60s, some white parishes did not accept Puerto Rican parishioners, so Puerto Ricans were displaced, looking for a place to worship and meet.[7] According to Felix M. Padilla, the systematic oppression that Puerto Ricans experienced in Chicago in the 1960s created a psychological climate for riot. Puerto Ricans faced racial discrimination, class-related hardships, and lived on the margins of a city that only valued them for their cheap labor.[8]\n",

Winkler, Burke, and Milford Jones were captured in downtown St. Louis on June 5, 1925 after a high-speed chase and shootout with the St. Louis police.

Looking for beer money, Walker robbed them of $40 and shot them to death while the couple fished in a St. Clair County creek.[1] He was executed by lethal injection at Stateville Correctional Center at the age of 50, becoming the first person to be executed in Illinois since 1962.[2][3] The execution was considered botched because the lethal injection machine was unable to make the drugs go through the kinked lines.[4][5][6][7]\nWalker was born on April 28, 1940, in Fayetteville, Illinois, to Jess and Lucille Walker, who divorced while Charles was still young. Both his father and stepfather were alcoholics. At age 8, Walker got drunk on moonshine after his father gave him some to try. By age 12, his stepfather was taking him out to drink in local taverns. At age 14, Walker started committing crimes and began carrying out minor offenses and burglaries. A year later, he was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor after he was caught buying beer for his younger cousin.[8][9]\nDuring his sophomore year, Walker dropped out of high school, left home, and headed to Florida. He returned to Illinois six months later and continued his life of crime, committing multiple burglaries. At age 17, Walker was convicted of burglary and was sent to Menard Correctional Center for six and a half years. Less than a year after his release, Walker broke into a tavern and stole money and alcohol. He was sent back to Menard for an additional four years.[8][9] In 1961, Walker's father was fatally shot in O'Fallon. The man convicted of the killing served two years in jail before being released.[10]\n",

This led to protests and boycotts from many Mexican students and families. Finally, in June 1974, the Chicago Board of Education approved $8.9 million in funding to build a high school in Pilsen. Benito Juarez Community Academy opened in 1977 and as of 2017 has a 94 percent Latino student body. The school is decorated with murals and statues that portray Mexican culture and famous leaders.[4]\nPrior to the opening of Juarez, Pilsen area students attended Carter Harrison Technical High School. The Pilsen community asked for a senior high school of their own since the students had to cross gang territory to get to Harrison.[5] Other factors included racial tensions at Harrison itself and Pilsen parents worrying about their children getting into trouble away from their watch.[6] A March 1972 boycott of two area schools, the Froebel branch of Harrison and Jirka School, from Mexican origin people gave impetus to have Juarez built.[7]\n",

Dunbar opened in 1942[6] and is operated by the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) district. The school is named in honor of the African\u2013American poet, novelist, and playwright Paul Laurence Dunbar.[7]\nOpening in September 1942[8] as a Dunbar Trade School, the school was created to provide skill workers for the war. When the school opened, the school had a student enrollment of 1,500; Mostly all of which were African\u2013American. The school was considered as a \"vocational branch\" of Wendell Phillips High School, considering both schools were predominately African\u2013American. In 1946, the Chicago Public Schools changed the trade school into a public high school, accepting ninth grade students in January of that year. The school's first location was in a former elementary school building located at 4401 South St.  Lawrence Avenue. In addition to the school building, twenty\u2013two mobile classroom which served as vocational shops were constructed on the site over the course of several months after its opening.[9]\nBy 1952, Dunbar suffered from issues dealing with overcrowding and aging of the school building. The Chicago Board of Education decided that a new school building was needed for Dunbar. A vacant site about two and a half miles north from the school's location was voted on and selected as the new Dunbar's location in mid\u20131954; costing the district a mere $7 million to construct.[10] The groundbreaking ceremony for the new school occurred in April 1955 with Chicago school officials and then newly elected Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley, construction began at 3000 South Parkway Avenue (now Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive) shortly thereafter. The new Dunbar Vocational High School building opened for students for the 1956\u201357 school year.[11] By the school's 20th anniversary in 1962, the enrollment was at 2,300; which included students taking night classes and drop-outs enrolled in trade classes.[12]\n",

Roemer Jr., considered DeStefano to be the worst torture-murderer in the history of the United States.[1] The Outfit used the mentally unstable and sadistic DeStefano for the torture-murders of Leo Foreman and Arthur Adler, the murder of DeStefano's younger brother, Michael DeStefano (an Outfit enforcer), and many others. However, due to DeStefano's deranged mental state, the Outfit never let him become a made man.

Destefano Sr. was a laborer and, later on in life, a grocer and real estate salesman who died of natural causes in 1942, at age 77. Rosalie was a housewife, who throughout her life was supported by the contributions of her children. She died in October 1960. In all, the DeStefanos had seven children, three sons and four daughters. Not long after his birth, Sam DeStefano and his family moved to Herrin, Illinois, where his father worked in the local coal mine. After the labor-related turmoil surrounding the Herrin Massacre, the DeStefano family moved north to Chicago's Little Italy.[citation needed]\n",

Lang was charged with having killed two prostitutes in Chicago, in 1965 and 1971. The cases achieved national attention because Lang could not be convicted as he was deaf, mute, unable to read or write, and did not know lip-reading or sign language.\nLang was six years old when his parents divorced; subsequently his mother could no longer afford tuition for his special training. Lang had worked at Chicago truck loading docks when he was charged with murder in 1965, shortly after the death of his mother.[1] In November 1965, Lang had picked up 37-year-old prostitute, Ernestine Williams at a local bar. Williams was found stabbed to death the next day. After a witness told Chicago police Lang had been the last person seen with Williams, they located him at his home, a public housing apartment where he stayed with a younger sister and older brother. Police found blood stained clothes in Lang's home and he was arrested.[1] When the case could not go to trial, Lang was ordered confined to a mental hospital in order to learn sign language so that he could stand trial. When this failed, his lawyer pressed for a trial; a key witness had died, the case was dismissed and Lang was freed in February 1971.[2]\nFive months after his release, another prostitute was killed in Chicago. On July 21, 1971, 29\u2013year old Earline Brown was found dead in a hotel room on the city's west side. Blood stains were found on Lang's clothes and he was arrested again on August 11, 1971. The case went to trial. As one piece of evidence, prosecutors introduced a drawing Lang had made during his interrogation, showing a woman with an \"X\" drawn over her.[2] Lang was convicted in January 1972 by a jury and sentenced to 14\u201325 years in prison.[1] In both cases Lang was represented by the deaf attorney Lowell J. Myers.[3] The verdict was overturned in 1975 by an appellate court, ruling that Lang had not been able to adequately defend himself. Lang was then confined to mental institutions and jails and periodically retested for his ability to stand trial.[4]\n",

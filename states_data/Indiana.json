He went into a restroom near the mall's food court, and did not come out until an hour and two minutes later, at which point he started shooting.[3]\n"

Celebrated in both the architectural and popular press as a tour-de-force of late modernism, it was a splendid example of Graves' imaginative, sophisticated work. It stood, along with Graves' Hanselman House, Richard Meier's New Harmony Athenaeum \u2014which was related to the Snyderman House\u2014and the buildings of Columbus, Indiana, as national icons of modern architecture located in the state of Indiana (Graves' home state).\nIn her feature article on the Snyderman House in Progressive Architecture, Suzanne Stephens wrote in 1978 that \"Because of the house's successful fragments and particular spaces, because of its manner of referring back to previous work as well as anticipating that which is to come, it will probably occupy a prominent place in the history of Michael Graves' oeuvre.\"\nMartin Filler, in an overview of Graves' work as of 1980, wrote that \"The Synderman House is a central work in Michael Graves' career. It is his largest completed building to date, but its significance comes not from its size. It is transitional work, and transitional works in architecture are much rarer than in other art forms, a result of the architectural artifact taking so long to produce.  The Snyderman House, designed in 1972 and completed five years later, spans Michael Graves' two stylistic phases.  The house is composed of a white, cage-like exterior frame, typical of his first projects. But within that Cubist grill are set massive volumes--sheer gray wall planes, an undulating terra cotta facade--and relatively small expanses of glass, all of which are more characteristic of his current projects.  This is an early Michael Graves building with a later Michael Graves building trapped inside it, fighting to emerge.  Its debt both in form and color to the earlier work of John Hejduk, and its impact on later work by other architects (such as Richard Meier's Atheneum of 1975-70 in New Harmony, Ind.) confirm it as an important work of the 1970's.\"\n"

They were memorialized in 2022.\nA white mob lynched George Johnson, Squire Taylor, and Charles Davis, all Black men, in Charlestown, Clark County, Indiana, in 1871.[1] The three men were accused of killing the family of Cyprus Park, a farmer who lived near Henryville, Indiana. A neighbor near the Parks family believed that he was also a target but managed to keep the assailants out of his home. The neighbor believed that the assailants were white. Even so, George Johnson, a Black man, was arrested on suspicion of committing the murders and was tortured until he confessed. He also gave out the names of two other Black men, Squire Taylor, and Charles Davis. These men were then arrested. The trial followed quite quickly. The grand jury declared the men not guilty based on the lack of evidence, but the men remained in custody and were sent to a Charlestown jail.[1]\nSoon after arrival, a white mob gathered and took the three men from the jail. The mob then hanged all three men and tortured Squire Taylor before he was killed. The guilt of the men in question was viewed as highly dubious by some at the time. Information about this spectacle lynching was released only a year later in a pamphlet titled, \u201cMurder and Mob Law in Indiana,\u201d  by James Hiatt. The author decried the lack of proof of the Black men's guilt and acknowledged the overwhelming evidence of their innocence.[2] No one was charged or arrested for the murder of these men even though the family came forward with names of suspects and filed a law suit against the sheriff involved. The actions of the white mob led the Indiana governor at the time, Conrad Baker, to call for the suppression of illegal organizations. Referring to the Enforcement Act of 1870, adopted during Reconstruction, Baker proposed that the U.S. Federal government could be asked to intervene to stop the actions of mobs that terrorized Black people. The Indiana government, however, did not follow through on that proposal and mob violence continued.[3]\n"

An example of a spectacle lynching, the event was public in nature and drew a crowd of over 1,000 white participants. Ward was dragged from a jail cell in broad daylight, struck in the back of the head with a sledgehammer, hanged from a bridge, and burned. His toes and the hobnails from his boots were collected as souvenirs. A grand jury was convened but no one was ever charged with the murder of Ward. It is the only known lynching in Vigo County. The lynching was memorialized 120 years later with a historical marker and ceremony.\nGeorge Ward was born in Kentucky, raised by his grandmother in Circleville, Ohio,[1] and moved to Terre Haute, Indiana around 1896.[2] Ward worked at the Filbeck Hotel as a porter, as a coal miner in nearby Seeleyville, and at the Terre Haute Car and Manufacturing Company. According to newspaper reports at the time of his death, Ward was considered by co-workers to be a good worker. He had a previous conviction for burglary and was jailed for 30 days in 1899.[1]\n"

Around 200 militiamen then opened fire on the mob, killing and injuring several rioters. The crowd then began looting hardware stores of weapons and stormed into black neighborhoods in an attempt to expel black people from Evansville.[1][2][3][4] The rioting continued until July 10 and a total of 12 people died during the riot, with more than 40 others seriously wounded and about 2,000 of Evansville's 8,000 black residents fleeing the city.[5][1][4]\nIt is unclear as to whether the mob or the militia were to blame for the deaths.

On July 14, 1919, hundreds of white boys 16 to 19 years old converged on Garfield Park. There they used bricks and clubs to beat any black people they came across. When a group of African-Americans took shelter in the house of Nathan Weather, a local black man, the white mob followed them and surrounded the house. Weather fired into the crowd in hopes of dispersing the mob. A seven-year-old onlooker, Charlotte Pieper, received a flesh wound from stray buckshot. Another youth, Paul Karbwitz, 18, was also hit. Police were eventually able to disperse the mob and quell the riot.[1]\nThis uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer of 1919. The Summer consisted of terrorist attacks on black communities, and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events such as the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also occurring in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and the Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people, respectively, and with both having many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.[2]\n"

The company was responsible for public transportation in Indianapolis, the capital city and transportation hub of the U.S. state of Indiana. The unionization effort was being organized by the Amalgamated Street Railway Employees of America who had successfully enforced strikes in other major United States cities. Company management suppressed the initial attempt by some of its employees to unionize and rejected an offer of mediation by the United States Department of Labor, which led to a rapid rise in tensions, and ultimately the strike. Government response to the strike was politically charged, as the strike began during the week leading up to public elections. The strike effectively shut down mass transit in the city and caused severe interruptions of statewide rail transportation and the 1913 city elections.\nA riot that lasted four days broke out on November 2 when strikebreakers attempted to restart transit services. At its height, eight to ten thousand rioters flooded downtown Indianapolis and vandalized the city's main business district. Numerous workers, strikebreakers, policemen, and bystanders were injured. Two strikebreakers and four union members were killed. The city police were unable to control the situation and refused orders to combat the rioters as the violence worsened. After pleas for help from city leaders following continued rioting on Election Day, Governor Samuel Ralston called out the Indiana National Guard and put the city under martial law on the evening of November 5.\n"

The grand jury declared the men not guilty based on the lack of evidence, but the men remained in custody and were sent to a Charlestown jail.[1]\nSoon after arrival, a white mob gathered and took the three men from the jail. The mob then hanged all three men and tortured Squire Taylor before he was killed. The guilt of the men in question was viewed as highly dubious by some at the time. Information about this spectacle lynching was released only a year later in a pamphlet titled, \u201cMurder and Mob Law in Indiana,\u201d  by James Hiatt. The author decried the lack of proof of the Black men's guilt and acknowledged the overwhelming evidence of their innocence.[2] No one was charged or arrested for the murder of these men even though the family came forward with names of suspects and filed a law suit against the sheriff involved. The actions of the white mob led the Indiana governor at the time, Conrad Baker, to call for the suppression of illegal organizations. Referring to the Enforcement Act of 1870, adopted during Reconstruction, Baker proposed that the U.S. Federal government could be asked to intervene to stop the actions of mobs that terrorized Black people. The Indiana government, however, did not follow through on that proposal and mob violence continued.[3]\n"

He was reportedly jumped by two men and was bashed across the skull with a nail-covered club.[1] The news of the murder spread through town, and suspects were quickly identified that same night. Of those who were questioned, Henderson and Rowland were arrested in Rockport.\nShortly after authorities placed Rowland and Henderson in the local jail, a large group of angry white people used sledgehammers and a broken telegraph pole to ram into the jail.[2] While the mob was getting ready to hang Rowland, he said that he had one more accomplice named \u2018Crowfoot\u2019. The white crowd first pulled Rowland out of his cell and hanged him from a tree on the east side of the courthouse, before shooting his body with bullets.[2] The group returned to retrieve Henderson from his cell. They shot him in his cell, dragged him across the courtyard, and hanged him next to Rowland.[1]\n"

Most of the stolen money was never recovered.\nThe gang was broken up by the lynchings of ten of its members by vigilante mobs in 1868. The murders created an international diplomatic incident with Canada and Great Britain, a general public uproar, and international newspaper coverage. No one was ever identified or prosecuted for the lynchings.\nThe Reno Brothers have been portrayed in at least three films, including Elvis Presley's film debut in Love Me Tender (1956), in which he starred as Clint Reno, and Rage at Dawn (1955), featuring Randolph Scott.\n"

Scott had fled after being accused of a crime in nearby Eaglesfield, Indiana, and was captured near Indianapolis and brought to the Clay County jail in Brazil, Indiana.[1] Rumors swirled that a mob might form, but the local Sheriff, James Lankford, paid them no heed. However, the man left in charge of the jail, ex-Sheriff Jacob Baumunk, took the precaution of giving the keys to Sheriff Lankford, who would not be on-site at the jail, after locking up.[2] Sometime between one and three in the morning on Sunday, December 12, a mob of over 100 men, masked, descended on the jail and demanded that Baumunk give them the keys.[1][3] After informing the mob that he did not have the keys, he was told to \u201cretire to his room.\u201d[2]\nAfter Baumunk removed himself, the mob began to attack the jail with sledgehammers and the like in order to reach Scott\u2019s cell. Between three and four in the morning, Scott was removed from his cell by the mob who took him to a nearby oak tree, where he was hanged. Scott\u2019s body remained there until he was discovered by the Clay County Coroner, Dr. George Pell, who transported Scott\u2019s body to the courthouse around seven in the morning.[2] Prior to this, Scott\u2019s hanged body had been viewed by \u201cseveral thousand\u201d individuals. After his body was transported to the courthouse,\u00a0it was \u201cexhibited for public inspection\u201d before finally being released to family members near Indianapolis.[1]\nThis crime-related article is a stub.

A third African-American suspect, 16-year-old James Cameron, had also been arrested and narrowly escaped being killed by the mob; an unknown woman and a local sports hero intervened, and he was returned to jail. Cameron later stated that Shipp and Smith had committed the murder but that he had run away before that event.[1]\nThe local chapter of the NAACP had tried, unsuccessfully, to evacuate the suspects from town to avoid the mob violence. The NAACP and the State's Attorney General pressed to indict leaders of the lynch mob, but, as was typical in lynchings, no one was ever charged for their deaths, nor for the attack on Cameron.[2]\n"

Prior to this move, he had resided with his great aunt and great uncle, Fannie and Robert Smith, since he had been placed in their care at nine months old.

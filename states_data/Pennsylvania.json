        "paragraph": "\nKermit Barron Gosnell (born February 9, 1941) is an American former physician[2] and serial killer.  He provided abortions at his clinic in West Philadelphia.  Gosnell was convicted of the murders of three infants who were born alive after using drugs to induce birth, was convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of one woman during an abortion procedure, and was convicted of several other medically related crimes.[3][4][5][6][7]\nGosnell, based in the Mantua neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned and operated the Women's Medical Society Clinic, a non-compliant abortion clinic that was dubbed a \"house of horrors\" during the trial.[8] He was a prolific prescriber of OxyContin.[9] In 2011, Gosnell, his wife Pearl, and eight employees were charged with a total of 32 felonies and 227 misdemeanors in connection with deaths, illegal medical services, and regulatory violations. Pearl and the eight employees pleaded guilty to various charges in 2011 while Gosnell pleaded not guilty and sought a jury trial.[10]\nIn May 2013, Gosnell was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of three of the infants and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, an adult patient at the clinic following an abortion procedure. Gosnell was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour informed consent law. After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.[11][12] Gosnell was sentenced to an additional 30 years in prison for federal drug charges.[13]\nGosnell was born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the only child of a gas station operator and a government clerk[14] in an African-American family.[15] He was a student at the city's Central High School from which he graduated in 1959.[16][17] Gosnell initially attended the University of Pennsylvania,[18] then graduated from Dickinson College with a bachelor's degree.[19] He received his medical degree at the Thomas Jefferson University in 1966.[16]\nIt has been reported that Gosnell spent four decades practicing medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and a teen aid program.[16] He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua.[14][20] Gosnell told The Philadelphia Inquirer in October 1972: \"As a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them.\"[21]\nThat same year, Gosnell also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental \"Super Coil\" method invented by Harvey Karman. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. However, complications from the procedure were reported by nine of the women, with three of these reporting severe complications.[22][23]\nThe 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a \"respected man\" in his community, and a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce's \"Young Philadelphian of the Year\" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House.[21] By the late 1980s, however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien.[21]\nGosnell has been married three times. His third and current wife, Pearl, had worked at the Women's Medical Society as a full-time medical assistant from 1982 until their marriage in 1990.[1]  They have two children.[24] Gosnell has four other children from his two previous marriages.[24] In covering his background, media commentators drew attention to the \"incredibly diverse\" portrayals of Gosnell, touching on both his community works \u2013 the creation of the halfway house and teen aid program \u2013 contrasted with portrayals of his practice as an abortion mill in which viable fetuses and babies were routinely killed following illegal late-term procedures.[16]\n",

Pittsburgh, along with 110 other cities, burned for several days and 3,600 National Guardsmen were needed to quell the disorder. The neighborhoods most impacted were the Hill District, North Side, and Homewood, with casualties including one death and 36 injuries. Over 100 businesses were either vandalized or looted with arsonists setting 505 fires. After six days, order was finally restored on April 11, with property damage surpassing $600,000 (equivalent to $4.68\u00a0million in 2021) and 1,000 arrests being made by law enforcement. Many of the areas affected by the disorder would never fully recover in the following decades.[1][2][3][4][5]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Eddie Polec murder case centers on the murder of a 16-year-old Edward William Polec.[1] that took place on the front steps of his church in the Philadelphia Fox Chase neighborhood on the night of Friday, November 11, 1994. The case drew national media attention because it happened in a middle-class residential part of the city not customarily known for such a crime. Adding to its controversy was that it was carried out by a band of mixed-race youth from neighboring Montgomery County's upscale suburban Abington Township.[1][2] The Philadelphia 911 emergency phone service and the Philadelphia police were extraordinarily slow in responding that night.[1][3]\nThe murder of Eddie Polec was the end result of minor hostilities that had developed between Fox Chase youth and a young female from Abington Township the week before, outside a Fox Chase McDonald's Restaurant. A group of Fox Chase teenagers were alleged to have upset the girl by tossing a plastic cup of soda into her car. This much was later admitted to by the Fox Chase youth.[1] But when word of the incident got back to Abington Township, it grew out of proportion to include a false rumor that she had been raped in the McDonald's parking lot.[1][2] In response, a group of Abington teenagers decided to retaliate on her behalf in conjunction with a warning she had allegedly made the night of the initial incident just before departing Fox Chase: \"You're all getting [expletive] beat up next weekend.[4]\"\nAccording to witnesses, she was seen again in Fox Chase early the following Friday night driving the same vehicle, this time along with Abington youth in another car, the passengers of both cars making threats similar to the one she had made the week before, only this time for later that night. Both vehicles then departed Fox Chase, and around 9:30 P.M. five carloads packed with other Abington teenagers arrived in their wake in what was described as a tightly formed caravan.[1] It first stopped at a Fox Chase 7-Eleven store, and after taking over its parking lot, some of its passengers got out and demanded directions to the McDonald's. The one perceived to be the leader was overheard to say, \"Come on, we have to do this. We have a job to get done. Let's do this before the police come.\" Before returning to their cars he was witnessed jumping up and down shouting: \"I'm so psyched, I could kill someone.[1]\"\nJust before 10:00 P.M.[5] the caravan arrived at the McDonald's . Its passengers then jumped out and began chasing every Fox Chase youth they saw with broken off hockey sticks[4] and baseball bats. According to one account, they outnumbered the Fox Chase teenagers thirteen to two. They cornered one and began severely beating him with bats until his friends could pull him free. The Fox Chase teenagers then scattered, but the rampage spread out to encompass a much wider portion of Fox Chase.\nResidents witnessing the melee overtaking their normally peaceful neighborhood began calling Philadelphia's 911 emergency response service in growing numbers, each caller expecting police to be sent out right away.[4] Some callers described what looked to be as many as 40 to 50 kids shouting obscenities,[4] smashing bottles, hurling rocks, and breaking car windows.[1]\nBut with no police patrol cars being dispatched, the caravan began racing recklessly throughout Fox Chase until finally zeroing in on one particular young male it saw near to the front steps of his church, Eddie Polec, who had been waiting there to walk home with his younger brother when he found himself being chased down by the succession of cars coming toward him. As the caravan sharply pulled into the church's parking lot cutting him off while simultaneously blocking other Fox Chase youth from coming to his aid, he tried running farther, but the first passenger out threw a baseball bat at his legs causing him to fall. The moment he was down that Abington teenager and others began striking him with baseball bats as he helplessly lay on the ground pleading for his life. He was then brought back to his feet once more so that some in the group could take bat swings directly at his head. After suffering eight forceful blows to the head this way he was then dropped back to the pavement, at which point another, wearing steel tipped boots, kicked him several times in the face.[5] With that final assault, the assailants then quickly fled in their caravan and were said to have been laughing and high-fiving one another as it sped away.[1] Authorities would later describe it as having been one of the most brutal murders in all Philadelphia history.[5]\nIt was 40 minutes after the first 911 call was placed that police were finally sent.[4] But by then it was too late. The young Eddie Polec lay bloodied and unconscious on the steps of a church where just a few short years before he had served as an altar boy.[1][6] He was immediately rushed to a hospital. But the following morning, after a full night of intensive medical emergency treatment had failed, Eddie Polec was pronounced dead.[1][4]\nAs the news of his death broke, it would later come out that while Eddie Polec's friends gathered in mourning outside the church where he had been killed the night before, four teenage girls from Abington who had been part of the caravan the night before attended a party for a friend just a few blocks away from the church, by all accounts totally unfazed by it.[1]\nThe news coverage of Eddie Polec's murder quickly went national, with the failure on the part of Philadelphia's 911 operators receiving special emphasis, much of the blame being placed directly on them. Fox Chase residents and others had complained about them being insensitive and unresponsive, and even expressing resentment as the callers tried to make clear the matter's urgency. The head of the union representing the operators stated that the reason for their questionable performance was because they had been working with outdated equipment, were underpaid, and had not been trained properly by the city. Nonetheless, Philadelphia's Mayor Ed Rendell took immediate disciplinary action against them, saying, \"Flaws in the system in no way, shape or form give anybody license to be abusive to citizens calling to report a crime.[4]\" In their own defense the operators soon after appeared on ABC's The Oprah Winfrey Show,[1][7] where they tried to argue that they had done a good job that night. But 911 tapes that had been released by the police and that were getting extensive airplay nationally by that point only confirmed the callers' accusations.[4] The 911 operators themselves, meantime, believed that because they were all African American they were being made political scapegoats.[1][4] But that claim was denounced by the president of Philadelphia's branch of the NAACP, Thornhill Cosby, who said: \"This is not a racial issue. It is a human issue.[3]\" The 911 workers appealed the city's disciplinary action and were eventually exonerated. The mayor, meantime, created a commission to explore ways the 911 system could be improved upon[4]\n",

The West Nickel Mines School was later demolished, and a new one-room schoolhouse, the New Hope School, was built at another location.\nRoberts backed a pickup truck to the front of the Amish schoolhouse and entered it at approximately 10:25\u00a0a.m. EDT, soon after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said he mumbled his words and did not make direct eye contact. After they said they had not seen a clevis pin, he went back to his truck and reentered the school holding a Springfield Armory XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the truck. Zook and her mother, who was visiting, took this opportunity to escape and run toward a nearby farm for help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if they got away.[5]\nThey reached the farm, where they asked Amos Smoker to call 9-1-1. Meanwhile, the boys carried in lumber, a shotgun, a stun-gun, wires, chains, nails, tools, a small bag and wooden board with multiple sets of metal eye-hooks. The bag held a change of clothes, toilet paper, candles, and flexible plastic ties. Using wooden boards, Roberts barricaded the front door.[5]\nRoberts ordered the girls to line up against the chalkboard and allowed a pregnant woman, three parents with infants, and all remaining boys to exit. One girl, nine-year-old Emma Fisher, escaped without her older sister.[6]\nSmoker's 9-1-1 call was recorded at 10:36\u00a0a.m.  An article, \"Revisiting the Amish Schoolhouse Massacre\", described the situation prior to the arrival of the first Pennsylvania State Police troopers: \"An Amish adult male from this farm, with his two large dogs, took the bold opportunity to stealthily approach the windowless back wall of the schoolhouse. Hoping for an opportunity to help the little girls, he slowly crept around one side of the wooden structure and positioned himself as an observer next to a side window.\" It continued, \"Observing that the first police patrol vehicle to approach the scene was not slowing down to stop, the Amish man quickly withdrew from his hiding place and sprinted towards the roadway to wave down the trooper, who did a fast U-turn and parked. That would be the last successful attempt at an unnoticed move upon the building by anyone.\"[7][8]\nThe first trooper had arrived at approximately 10:42, about six or seven minutes after the 9-1-1 call. The police, while waiting for reinforcements, attempted to communicate with Roberts via the PA system in their patrol cars.[5] They asked Roberts to throw out his weapons and exit the schoolhouse. Roberts refused, demanding that the officers leave.[9] By 11:00\u00a0a.m. a large crowd \u2014 including police officers, emergency medical technicians, and residents of the village \u2014 had assembled both outside the schoolhouse and at a nearby ambulance staging area. County and state police dispatchers had briefly established telephone contact with Roberts as he continued to threaten violence against the children.[8]\nDuring interviews conducted later it became apparent that all of the girls recognized the danger they were in. Some conversed among themselves throughout the ordeal. Shortly before Roberts began shooting, two sisters, Marian and Barbara Fisher, ages 13 and 11, requested that they be shot first, so that the others might be spared. Barbara was wounded, while Marian was killed.[10]\nAt approximately 11:07\u00a0a.m., Roberts began shooting the victims. State troopers immediately approached. As the first trooper in line reached a window, the shooting stopped abruptly; Roberts had committed suicide. During the shooting, he fired at least 13 rounds from his pistol.[11]\n",

Two escorts, Harlow Cuadra and Joseph Kerekes, were charged and convicted for Kocis' murder and subsequently given a sentence of life imprisonment without any possibility of parole.\nBryan Charles Kocis was raised in Larksville, Pennsylvania, the first son of Michael and Joyce Kocis. He graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology, after which he worked as a medical photographer for a local eye doctor.[4]\nAfter he left the medical photography business, he tried several business ventures, all of which failed. In 2001, he was involved in a cellular phone venture. After being charged with sexual assault on a 15-year-old boy,[3] he was removed as a partner in that venture, and established Cobra Video, also in 2001.[5]  Later that year, Kocis filed for bankruptcy in federal court.[2][3]  Kocis created two legal entities with the name \"Cobra Video LLC\": one in Pennsylvania in 2002,[6] the other in Delaware in 2005.[7]\nCobra competed in the market niche of low-budget, Barely Legal-style bareback films.  The company was dedicated to \"Capturing the Erotic Essence of Youth\" by producing pornographic movies of young men who looked as if they could be adolescents having sex without condoms.[4]\nIn the five years after, between his bankruptcy and his death, Kocis' Cobra Video did very well financially.  At the time of his death, Kocis had amassed personal possessions which included a Maserati convertible, a BMW sport utility vehicle and an Aston Martin car.[2][4]  In addition to his Dallas Township home, Kocis owned two adjacent Rice Township parcels of land, valued at over $400,000, with no mortgages.[2][3]\nIn 2002, police found a videotape of Bryan Kocis, then 39, and a 15-year-old male in his home.[4] Kocis pleaded guilty to one count of sexual abuse of a child. He was charged with child pornography, and transportation of a minor for sexual purposes. Since the boy had lied about his age Kocis was given a probation sentence.[2]\nIn 2006 a judge, Michael Conahan, signed paperwork changing Kocis' charge from sex assault to corruption of minors. Kocis' former attorney, Al Flora, said the change was made because the original charge of sexual assault of a child was a mistake and that, \"We didn't realize there was an error until 2006.\" As a result of that change, Kocis was not required to be registered as a Megan's Law offender.[8]  Conahan later pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges in relation to the infamous \"Kids for Cash\" scandal,[9] and is serving 17.5 years in prison.\nBeginning in  early 2004, Kocis cast Sean Lockhart, in Cobra's Every Poolboy's Dream under the stage name \"Brent Corrigan\".[10] He starred in several more films in that year, notably Schoolboy Crush in 2004, in Bareboned Twinks and Casting Couch 4 in 2005, and other releases in 2006. On September 13, 2005, Corrigan's attorney announced that Corrigan was underaged when he filmed scenes for Cobra Video,[11] and had used a fake ID to participate in those scenes.[4][12] Cobra denied that it was ever aware of such allegations and publicly stated that it had copies of Corrigan's identity documents claiming a birth year of 1985.[12] A civil lawsuit between the two parties began soon after.\nKocis denied the allegations and began a counter-suit for copyright infringement, for the unauthorized use of Cobra's \u201cBrent Corrigan\u201d name.[12]  A final hearing in the matter was scheduled for February 21, 2007.[13]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Pittsburgh Food & Beverage Company was a holding company created in 1991 by entrepreneur Michael P. Carlow to manage a pair of struggling but iconic companies in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Originally joining the candymaker D. L. Clark Co., maker of the Clark Bar, with the Pittsburgh Brewing Company and their Iron City Beer, it expanded to add further regional businesses: Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania's L. E. Smith Glass Company, the Fort Wayne, Indiana-based Wayne Candies, Inc., and Pittsburgh's City Pride Bakery. Its 1995 collapse in bankruptcy and the subsequent conviction of Carlow for using a check kiting scheme, said to have defrauded a local bank of more than $31\u00a0million, was reported nationally.\nIn 1991, Michael P. Carlow was a 39-year-old entrepreneur who had recently sold a large cement business built by purchasing and consolidating shut-down firms in the region.  He also had a history of rejuvenating struggling companies, having done so with two furniture companies.  In 1991 he purchased the D. L. Clark Company,[1]  which had been founded in Allegheny City, now Pittsburgh's North Side, in 1886.  The previous owners, Leaf Candy Company, had retained some Clark products and moved their manufacture to the Chicago area, but had decided to discontinue production of the flagship Clark Bar, for which they had failed to achieve a market outside the region. The approximately $22 million[2] acquisition also included a range of other sweets made at Clark's O'Hara Township (suburban Pittsburgh) manufacturing facility, as well as former Leaf brands, Black Cow and Slo Poke.[3][4]\nLater that year, Carlow agreed to acquire another struggling beloved regional company, submitting the winning bid for the Pittsburgh Brewing Company, makers of Iron City beer in Pittsburgh's Lawrenceville neighborhood from the 1860s, which also produced Samuel Adams Boston Lager for the Boston Beer Company.  This company had been publicly owned before being bought by Australian Alan Bond, through his Bond Corporation Holdings five years before and was integrated into sister-company G. Heileman Brewing Company in 1988,[5] then separated again when Bond unloaded Heileman in 1991.  It was being sold as part of the liquidation of the Australian's brewing empire. Carlow created a holding company, Pittsburgh Food & Beverage, to manage Pittsburgh Brewing and D. L. Clark Co.,[6] completing the $15 million deal for Pittsburgh Brewing in February 1992.[7]  A couple of months later, in April 1992, another acquisition was added to Pittsburgh Food & Beverage, confectioner Wayne Candies of Fort Wayne, Indiana, manufacturer of Bun Bars, purchased from August Storck KG.[8]  A fourth business, L. E. Smith Glass Company, of Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, which had been purchased by Carlow in 1986,[3] would also be managed by Pittsburgh Food & Beverage.  Carlow and his father, Frank, each would own 47.5% of Pittsburgh Food & Beverage Company, with the remaining 5% owned by Larry Ousky.[9]\nCarlow continued plans to expand Pittsburgh Food & Beverage, in 1993 making unsuccessful bids for Whitman's Chocolates of Philadelphia and the former corporate parent of Pittsburgh Brewing, La Crosse, Wisconsin's G. Heileman Brewing Company.[1]  A successful acquisition in the spring of 1993 added the struggling City Pride Bakery, which was the last operating in the city of Pittsburgh.  Clark was reported to have returned to profitability in 1993, with part of the company's turnaround credited to contracts to make products for the Sam's American Choice and Ultra SlimFast brands.[1]  Pittsburgh Brewing, at the time the ninth largest in the country, likewise had expanded local market share.[1]  For this action in saving and rejuvenating local companies, Carlow was perceived as a 'corporate white knight',[10] and a local magazine called him a \"messianic hero\".[11]  Even when City Pride was shuttered in February 1994 after losing $4 million, locals still considered Carlow's contribution a net gain.[1]  Further expansion seemed imminent when in October 1994, Borden announced an agreement to sell Wise Foods, noted for their potato chips, along with Wise's subsidiary, Moore's Quality Snack Foods, to Pittsburgh Food & Beverage.[12]  However, this prospective $87.5 million purchase would unmask the fraud that would precipitate the downfall of Pittsburgh Food & Beverage.[7]\nCarlow had placed a $6 million non-refundable deposit for the purchase of the Borden-held brands, and had arranged financing contingent on the profitability of Clark over the succeeding 6 months, but it was almost immediately evident that Clark, facing shutdowns due to failed deliveries from suppliers whom Carlow had repeatedly put off paying, would fall short, and Carlow's financiers pulled out.[7][13]  This came in spite of an ongoing pattern of check-writing that artificially inflated revenues.  As later forensic accounting would reveal, starting in late 1993, Carlow and Ousky had begun a sequence of cascading bad check-writing among his companies intended to forestall payment of the growing debts, give the false impression of increased revenue, and mask the extraction of assets from the company, with each overdraft seemingly paid with a subsequent bad check from the account of another subsidiary.  Carlow paid Borden an additional $2 million deposit for a two-month extension of the financing deadline, and began double-shifting the Clark plant, selling the extra production to Karlov International, which the Carlows had formed to export Pittsburgh Food & Beverage's beer and candy to Russia.  To pay for this, the cycles of check kiting were ramped up, to the degree that with about $76 million in gross annual income, the companies had written checks worth a combined $560 million, half written in the three months Carlow tried to raise funding for the Wise purchase.  Most of these checks passed between different accounts within the same bank, racking up $500,000 in overdraft fees that were paid with additional bad checks.  The co-owners were found to have also written and cashed checks to themselves worth millions of dollars.[7][11][14]\nPittsburgh Food & Beverage and their Pittsburgh Brewing subsidiary were later found also to have underreported payroll to reduce insurance costs, and to have committed tax fraud for which an employee would be given a 30-month prison sentence.[15]  Likewise Social Security and credit union payments for Clark employees had vanished, while there were accusations that the executives had issued credit cards to fictitious managers and used them for personal expenses.[11]  Some of the money diverted from the Pittsburgh companies was found to have paid settlements resolving Small Business Administration obligations over similar behavior with previous companies the Carlows had owned, and to pay creditors of a previous kiting scheme.[11][14]\nWith the Borden deadline at hand and Carlow still unable to accumulate the necessary money, a routine audit by the company's financial institution, PNC Bank, uncovered the pattern of fraudulent behavior.  In all, Carlow was accused of defrauding PNC of $31.5 million (later adjusted to $31.3 million), and, declining Carlow's offer to pay off the debt with another check, PNC alerted the FBI and U. S. Attorneys.[14]  Borden immediately pulled out of the prospective sale, retaining the $8 million Carlow had given in earnest money.  He was forced by PNC to turn over operation of Pittsburgh Food & Beverage to their nominee to head the company, William A. Brandt, a business turnaround specialist, on February 7.  Among other challenges Brandt faced, payroll processing became impossible because Laurel Computer Services, the conglomerate's bookkeeper owned by a Carlow friend, refused to turn over the corporate records.[11]\nBrandt would soon call Clark a \"black hole\" and declared that it would have to close if a buyer was not found within days. Adding to Clark's liabilities was a $3 million debt still owed Leaf North America from the time of Carlow's purchase four years earlier.[16]  On February 17, the plant closed and most of its 180 workers were dismissed, a skeleton crew remaining to ship their remaining stock.[10]  This spurred Leaf to foreclose days later and reclaim the trademarks, accounts, unshipped inventory and equipment,[17] though after unionized workers physically blocked Leaf's attempt to remove the product and equipment,[18][11] the two sides reached an agreement wherein Leaf was allowed to remove the inventory, but left the equipment while a new buyer for Clark was sought. The same day PNC and two minor creditors petitioned for Pittsburgh Food & Beverage to be placed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.[17]\nThe case was assigned to U. S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Joseph L. Cosetti, who first had to address a challenge by Michael and Frank Carlow to the role of Brandt.  They argued that as minority owner, Michael Carlow had lacked the authority to appoint Brandt and together they put forward their own turnaround expert.  However, following a mid-March accounting report, Cosetti concluded that liquidation was the only reasonable outcome, and Brandt was dismissed in favor of a trustee to supervise the company's dismemberment.[9]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nMonroeville Mall is a shopping mall located in the municipality of Monroeville, Pennsylvania, east of Pittsburgh.[1] It is located along heavily traveled U.S. Route\u00a022 Business (US\u00a022 Bus.) near the junction of Interstate 376 (I-376) and the Monroeville interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. It was completed in 1969, extensively renovated and expanded in 2003\u20132004, and includes Barnes & Noble, Cinemark Theatres, Dick's Sporting Goods, JCPenney, and Macy's as anchor tenants. It contains 1,418,700 square feet (131,800\u00a0m2) of leaseable retail space on 170 acres (0.7\u00a0km2), making it the largest shopping complex in Western Pennsylvania in terms of square footage.[2] It is one of two CBL-owned malls in the Pittsburgh area, the other being Westmoreland Mall in Greensburg.\nAdjacent to Monroeville Mall, several major shopping centers including the Miracle Mile Shopping Center, well-known national retailers and restaurants can be found along the U.S. Route 22 commercial corridor, the biggest such concentration of retailers and other commercial businesses in the eastern environs of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area. It is located at Mall Circle Drive, across from Monroeville Convention Center,[3] venue of the Pittsburgh Comicon, a comic book convention, from 2009 to 2014.\nWith 150 stores, Monroeville Mall is currently the eighth largest shopping mall in Pennsylvania.\nThe mall is famous for being the filming location of the 1978 George A. Romero horror film Dawn of the Dead.\nBefore the 1950s postwar migration movement, Monroeville was predominantly a rural farming area. The opening of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in the early 1950s followed by completion of Interstate 376 (Parkway East) in the early 1960s would expedite the growth of Monroeville and the eastern suburbs. In November 1954, the Miracle Mile Shopping Center opened for business with numerous shops and eateries. As the novelty of shopping malls made them increasingly popular in the 1960s, residents of Monroeville and the eastern suburbs shopped at the now-defunct Eastland Mall in nearby North Versailles, or at Greengate Mall (now demolished and rebuilt as Greengate Centre) in Greensburg, Westmoreland County.\nIn the mid-1960s, Don-Mark Realty (later Oxford Development Company) proposed building the largest shopping mall in the United States in the form of Monroeville Mall. For the development, Don-Mark acquired a 280-acre (1.1\u00a0km2) tract known as Harper's Mine. Despite local residents questioning whether the land was indeed a prime location for development, Don-Mark was confident that the site was perfect for the proposed mall. By 1966, grading equipment would begin leveling part of the massive site in preparation for the mall's construction. In fact, more than 5,000,000 cubic yards (3,800,000\u00a0m3) of dirt would be moved to level the 110-acre (0.45\u00a0km2) portion of the 280-acre (1.1\u00a0km2) site, with excavation costs totaling $2.5 million at the time. Construction on the $30 million mall would begin in 1967 and last for two years. Surrounding the mall, the massive parking lots were paved and spaced to accommodate 6,500 vehicles.[4]\nOn Tuesday, May 13, 1969, the 1,130,000-square-foot (105,000\u00a0m2) Monroeville Mall opened its doors with Gimbels and Joseph Horne Co. at opposite ends and JCPenney in the middle. The five and dime G. C. Murphy store provided a lower-price alternative for shoppers on the lower level. The mall contained 125 stores on two levels and featured the Ice Palace, a skating rink. Another unique feature was the location of a local Italian restaurant directly adjacent to the rink, with large picture windows in its dining rooms that gave patrons direct views of skaters on the rink. The mall's opening would contribute to the eventual decline and closure of the East Hills Shopping Center in nearby Penn Hills, a smaller outdoor mall also anchored by Horne's.[5] It would also affect business at the nearby Miracle Mile Shopping Center, which was greatly impacted following the relocation of its JCPenney store to the Monroeville Mall, although business would gradually level out over time.[4]\nThe mall was decorated with fountains and plant life that flourished under enormous skylights. The Gimbels court of the mall featured a large yellow clock tower that housed 12 animated puppets, each one representing an ethnic group in the Pittsburgh area. One puppet performed every hour, and all performed together at 1pm and 6pm. The court at the Horne's end of the mall had a large, circular fountain, surrounded by a seating area. The store selection in the mall ranged from high fashion to hardware. There was a bank, several places to eat, pharmacies, pubs and even a ministry center, as developers had intended on making the mall into an indoor \"town center\" for the Monroeville community.[4]\n",

The victims were Dean A. Finocchiaro, age 19; Thomas C. Meo, age 21; Jimi T. Patrick, age 19; and Mark R. Sturgis, age 22.\nThe murders were carried out by Cosmo DiNardo and Sean Michael Kratz, both age 20 at the time of the murders.[1] The four victims were murdered in three separate incidents, each after DiNardo arranged to sell them marijuana.[2][1]\nThe disappearances began on July 5, 2017, with Patrick being the first of the men to vanish. Two days later, on July 7, Meo, Finocchiaro, and Sturgis were also reported missing. Each of the four men was reported to be murdered the same day he went missing.[3]\nDiNardo, a drug dealer, confessed to killing the four men; he said he did so because he felt cheated or threatened during drug transactions.[8] He also told investigators where to find Jimi Patrick's body, buried in another grave on the property.[6] The only motive disclosed by investigators was that DiNardo said he wanted to set the victims up when they came to the farm to buy marijuana.[9]\nOn the afternoon of July 8, authorities tracked Finocchiaro's cell phone to a 90-acre (36-hectare) farm[10] in the Solebury Township owned by DiNardo's parents, Antonio and Sandra DiNardo, who also own a cement and construction company.[11]\nWhile being investigated for the four July 2017 Pennsylvania murders, DiNardo also claimed to be responsible for at least two other killings in the previous five years in Philadelphia.[12] Investigators have yet to verify these claims.[13]\nSecond cousins[1] Cosmo DiNardo (born January 21, 1997) and Sean Michael Kratz (born February 14, 1997), both age 20, were charged in the murders.\nOn July 10, DiNardo was arrested for an unrelated weapons charge.[5] Despite 30 run-ins with local police, DiNardo, the son of a wealthy businessman, had for unexplained reasons never been convicted of a crime.[14] DiNardo was later released after his father posted 10% of the $1 million bail.[1]\nOn July 12, DiNardo was arrested and charged for stealing and attempting to sell a car that belonged to Thomas Meo for $500.[15] Suspicion was also raised by the fact that Meo left his insulin in the car, something his family said would have been unusual for him to do.[15] His bail was set at $5 million. The next day, DiNardo confessed to the murder of the four men. In exchange for his confession, prosecutors stated that they would not seek the death penalty.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "Victor Hassine (1956\u20132008) was a prisoner for over 20 years in the Pennsylvania State Prison System.  Born in Egypt and raised in Trenton, NJ, he is the author of Life without Parole: Living in Prison Today which documents some stories of prison life, interviews with other prisoners and some short essays about his personal views of the prison and criminal justice system in the United States.\nHis book, which is currently in its fifth edition and has been renamed as Life without Parole: Living and Dying in Prison Today, is used by many sociology, criminal justice, and social work professors to help teach American justice and social control. Hassine, an intellectual who graduated from Dickinson College and New York Law School, offers a rare and intelligent insider's look at life in an American prison, including achievements and failures in the criminal justice system. Hassine's writings have been favorably reviewed by the New York Times and have garnered many awards, including two prestigious Pen American Awards in 1991 and 1992 for non-fiction writing. He also wrote poetry about prison life published in an Anthology of Prison Writings, The Crying Wall, published by Willow Tree Press in 2005.\nThis case arises out of a conspiracy involving Hassine and his co-conspirators George Gregory Orlowski and William Eric Decker, which culminated in the August 22, 1980, murder of James Puerale and the shootings of Albert \"Skip\" Kellet and Lois Kellet.\nThe evidence at trial showed that Hassine first met Orlowski in 1979, and that shortly thereafter they decided to open a store in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, called Greg's Quality Meat Market (\"the Market\"). The store was financed by Hassine's family, overseen and supervised by Hassine himself, and operated on a daily basis by Orlowski. However, the Market soon experienced financial problems, and, with Hassine's knowledge, Orlowski began selling marijuana and methamphetamine from a back room in the store.\nIn June 1980, Albert Kellet, a close friend of Orlowski, purchased $150 of methamphetamine at the Market. Upon returning home, Kellet discovered that the drugs were of inferior quality and he became enraged. He called Orlowski and invited him to his apartment under the false pretense of wishing to buy more methamphetamine. When Orlowski arrived, Kellet threatened him with a club, stole all of his money and drugs, and threw him out of the apartment.\nSeveral days later, Orlowski, Hassine, and Decker, among others, met at the Market to discuss Kellet's actions. The State's witnesses testified that at this meeting, Hassine announced that he wanted Kellet \"wasted\" and that if Lois Kellet, Albert's wife, was present, she \"was to go also, because any witnesses had to go.\" As a result, Hassine, Decker, and Orlowski made several attempts over the next month to obtain a gun with which to kill Kellet, and they investigated the possibility of paying two other individuals to have Kellet murdered. A number of confrontations between Hassine and Kellet also erupted during this time, and, on at least one occasion, Hassine instructed Decker to shoot Kellet and to kill him. Because it was daylight and a witness was present, Decker declined. Nevertheless, on August 22, 1980, Decker had his own encounter with Kellet, and he returned to the Market to tell Hassine that \"[t]onight's the night -- the cat's got to go. We'll use your gun.\"\nAccording to the State's witnesses, Hassine picked Decker up later that evening and drove him to Hassine's parents' house in Trenton, New Jersey. While Decker waited in the car, Hassine entered the house and obtained his father's .380 caliber Llama handgun. Hassine then drove Decker to Kellet's apartment building and gave him the gun and a New York Yankees batting helmet to cover his hair. As Decker approached the building, he saw Kellet in a first-floor apartment watching television with his wife Lois, along with James Puerale and George Sofield. Decker entered the apartment, surveyed the room, and opened fire, killing Puerale instantly and injuring Skip and Lois Kellet with shots to the head.\nThe police arrested Decker the next day, and arrested Hassine three months later, charging Hassine with first degree murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, and solicitation.\nThe State presented thirty-four witnesses at Hassine's trial, including Decker, who had negotiated a plea bargain with the District Attorney to avoid the death penalty. Decker and the other witnesses testified as to the details of the murder conspiracy and described Hassine's extensive involvement in the plot to murder Kellet.\n",

He was the hijacker-pilot of United Airlines Flight 93, crashing the plane into a field in a rural area near Shanksville, Pennsylvania\u2014after a passenger uprising\u2014as part of the coordinated attacks.[a]\nAfter a wealthy and secularist upbringing, Jarrah moved to Germany in 1996. He became involved in the planning of the September 11 attacks while attending Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW) in the late 1990s, meeting Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, forming what is now known as the Hamburg cell. Jarrah was recruited by Osama bin Laden for the attacks in 1999. Unique among the hijackers, he was close to his family and girlfriend. He was reportedly the only hijacker who had any significant apprehensions about carrying out the attacks.[1] His family and friends continue to deny his association with the attacks.[2]\nJarrah arrived in the United States in June 2000. He trained at Huffman Aviation together with Atta and Al-Shehhi with their flight instructor Rudi Dekkers from June 2000 to January 2001, after relocating to Florida from New Jersey.\nOn September 7, 2001, Jarrah flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark. Four days later, he boarded United Airlines Flight 93, and was believed to have taken over as the pilot of the aircraft along with his team of hijackers, which included Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Nami and Ahmed al-Haznawi, who together made an attempt to crash the plane into either the United States Capitol or the White House,[3] which was thwarted when the passengers started a revolt against the hijackers.[b]\nJarrah was born in Beirut, Lebanon, to a wealthy family. He was brought up in the Muslim quarter of the city, Tarik Jdideh, and received his primary and secondary education from schools in that area. His parents were nominally Sunni Muslim, although they lived a secular lifestyle. In his childhood, he had always wanted to fly planes, but his family discouraged this. \"I stopped him from being a pilot,\" his father told the Wall Street Journal a week after the attacks. \"I only have one son and I was afraid that he would crash.\"[4]\nFrom 1995 to 1996, while Jarrah was still living in Yemen, according to his family, somebody of the same name rented an apartment in Brooklyn, New York. The landlords claimed it was the same Ziad Jarrah as in the FBI photographs.[5]\nIn the spring of 1996, Jarrah moved to Germany with his cousin, Salim. They were there to take a certificate course in German at the University of Greifswald, which was required of foreigners studying in Germany who do not speak the language. While sharing an apartment with his cousin, he reportedly attended discos and beach parties, and his attendance at the mosque fell off. He met Aysel \u015eeng\u00fcn, a German-born woman of Turkish ancestry studying dentistry, and the two became good friends. They dated on and off for the remainder of his life and lived together briefly, which vexed his more religious friends.[6]\nIn September 1997, Jarrah left Greifswald and instead began studying aerospace engineering at the Fachhochschule (University of Applied Sciences) in Hamburg, while working at a Volkswagen paint shop in nearby Wolfsburg. While in Hamburg, he rented an apartment from Rosemarie Canel, who would paint a portrait of him that he would bring back as a gift for his mother that December.[7]\n",

Samuel Gorman, a 17-year-old black boy was sent to jail for the alleged murder of William E. Taylor.\nSamuel Gorman, a 17-year-old African-American worked for hay merchant William E. Taylor who owned the shop on 503 Main Street.[3] On July 23, 1919, Taylor told him that he didn't have any more work for Gorman and he allegedly hit him over his head, fatally wounding him.[1] Gorman was quickly apprehended by Chief of Police Clark. Word got out that the suspect had been arrested and a white mob quickly surrounded the jail. The police were called out en masse to prevent the mob from storming the building.[4] [5] [2]\nThis uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer, of 1919. The Summer consisted of terrorist attacks on black communities, and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also occurring in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively, and with both having many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.[6]\nNotes\nReferences\n",

        "paragraph": "Terrance \"Terry\" Williams (born February 27, 1966, in Pennsylvania) is a prisoner who was sentenced to death for a murder committed at the age of 18.  He was also convicted and sentenced to 27 years for a third-degree murder he committed six months earlier.  He was scheduled to be executed on October 3, 2012; on September 28, 2012, a Philadelphia judge, Teresa Sarmina, granted a stay of execution.[1] His death sentence was overturned June 9, 2016 by the U.S. Supreme Court via Williams v. Pennsylvania, and he was resentenced to life imprisonment without parole.[2]\nIn January, 1984, Williams stabbed to death Herbert Hamilton, a 50-year-old resident of West Philadelphia.  Williams was a 17-year-old at the time of the murder.  Williams lured Hamilton to bed, then stabbed him over 20 times and beat him with a baseball bat.[3]\nAs cited from court records: \"Williams retrieved a nearby baseball bat, chased after [Herbert] Hamilton, and beat him with the bat until Hamilton was bloody and severely wounded. Williams then recovered the butcher knife and stabbed Hamilton approximately twenty times--twice in the head, ten times in the back, once in the neck, four times in the chest, and once each in the abdomen, arm, and thumb. Finally, Williams drove the butcher knife through the back of Hamilton's neck until it protruded through the other side. He then doused Hamilton's body with kerosene and unsuccessfully attempted to set fire to it.\"[4]\nSix months later, Williams, then 18, and Marc Draper convinced Amos Norwood to go to a cemetery, where they beat him to death with a tire iron and then hid the body behind some tombstones.  Williams later returned and set the body on fire.[5]  Williams took Norwood's car, along with cash and credit cards he stole from the body, and drove to Atlantic City with Draper and Ronald Rucker.\nAgain citing from court records: \"Williams exited the vehicle, approached Draper, and said quietly, \"Play it off like you going home, like you want a ride home, and we gonna take some money.\" Draper understood Williams to be proposing a robbery. The two then got inside Norwood's automobile and Draper began to provide false directions to his \"home.\" In reality, Draper's directions led Norwood to a secluded area adjacent to the Ivy Hill Cemetery. Once there, Draper reached over the backseat, grabbed Norwood from behind and ordered him \"to be quiet and get out of the car.\" Norwood stopped the vehicle and complied.\nWilliams and Draper then led Norwood into the cemetery and ordered him to lie facedown near a tombstone. A quick search of Norwood's person revealed $20 hidden in his sock. At this point, Norwood began to plead for his life. The two assailants responded by removing Norwood's clothing and tying him up; Norwood's hands were bound behind his back with his shirt, his legs were bound together with his pants, and his socks were forcefully jammed into his mouth. Once Norwood was bound, Williams said to Draper, \"Wait, I'm going to the car. We're getting ready to do something.\" And he walked off.\nWilliams returned with a tire iron and a socket wrench, the latter of which he gave to Draper. Draper, seemingly having second thoughts, urged Williams to leave. Williams replied, \"I know what I'm doin, I know what I'm doin. Don't worry about it, I know what I'm doin.\" He then began battering Norwood's head with the tire iron. When he noticed that Draper was frozen in place, Williams said, \"Man, you with me[?] We got to do this together.\" Draper then sprung into action himself, striking Norwood repeatedly with the socket wrench. This violent scene continued until Norwood lay motionless and dead.\"[6]\nAfter the use of Norwood's calling card led police to Rucker, who in turn implicated Williams and Draper.[5]  Draper was arrested on July 20, 1984.  During questioning, he gave a full confession to the police.[5]  A search was conducted of Williams residence, and Norwood's jacket was found.  Williams surrendered to the police on July 23, 1984 and although Draper was in protective custody, was able to send several letters urging Draper to change his story.  Draper instead turned the letters over to the police.[5]\nWilliams was convicted of third-degree murder in the death of Hamilton and was sentenced to 27 years, and was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Norwood and sentenced to death.[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nSkylar Annette Neese (February 10, 1996\u00a0\u2013 July 6, 2012) was an American teenage girl who disappeared from her home in Star City, West Virginia, around midnight on July 6, 2012.[2] Neese's body was found on January 16, 2013, in Wayne Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania.[3]\nNeese was murdered by two of her high school best friends, Shelia Eddy and Rachel Shoaf. On January 3, 2013, Shoaf confessed to authorities that she and Eddy planned and carried out Neese's murder. Shoaf pleaded guilty to second-degree murder on May 1, 2013, and was sentenced to 30 years in prison with eligibility for parole after 10 years.[4] Eddy pleaded guilty to first-degree murder on January 24, 2014, and was sentenced to life in prison with eligibility for parole after 15 years. Neese's disappearance led to new West Virginia legislation that made changes to the AMBER Alert missing child alert system.[5]\nOn July 5, 2012, Neese returned to her family's Star City, West Virginia apartment after working a shift at Wendy's. Her apartment complex's surveillance video shows Neese left the apartment via her bedroom window at 12:30\u00a0a.m. on July 6 and got into a sedan.[2] Neese's father said she did not take her cell phone charger, her window was left open and that she planned on coming home.[6]\nOn the night of the murder, Shoaf and Eddy invited Neese to sneak out with them. Neese, who had recently fallen out with the two, was initially hesitant. After a series of phone calls and texts from the girls, Neese changed her mind.\nShoaf and Eddy had been planning Neese's murder for months. They left Eddy's house prepared to carry out the assault on Neese, bringing with them kitchen knives, paper towels, bleach, cleaning cloths, clean clothes and a shovel. They concealed the knives in their hoodies.\nAt approximately 12:30\u00a0a.m., Neese climbed out of her bedroom window, crossed the street and got into the back seat of a four-door sedan. Law enforcement officers later determined that the sedan had been in the possession of Eddy that evening. The three girls then headed northwest from Star City toward Blacksville via U.S. Route 19. The perpetrators had planned to travel along W.V. Route 7, but turned around after spotting a state police car. They eventually arrived at their destination just across the Pennsylvania state border, a spot where all three of the girls had occasionally smoked marijuana.\nOnce the girls were out of the vehicle, the perpetrators told Neese they had forgotten to bring a lighter. Neese volunteered to go back to the vehicle to fetch her own lighter. Once Neese had turned her back, Shoaf and Eddy counted to three, their agreed-upon signal, then began to stab her. Neese attempted to run, but was only able to run a few feet (a meter or two) before Shoaf tackled her to the ground and continued the assault. Neese managed to wrestle Shoaf's knife from her and, in an apparent attempt to defend herself, cut Shoaf's ankle. Eddy continued to stab Neese until there was complete silence and, according to Shoaf, \"Neese's neck stopped making gurgling sounds.\"\nShoaf and Eddy then attempted to bury Neese, dragging her to the side of the road, but the road ran along a creek and the soil there was too hard and rocky to dig a hole. They instead covered Neese's body with rocks, fallen branches and dirt. They returned to the car to clean themselves and the murder scene, then left the scene.\n",

        "paragraph": "Gary Michael Heidnik (November 22, 1943 \u2013 July 6, 1999) was an American criminal who kidnapped, tortured, and raped six women (murdering two of them), while holding them captive in a self-dug pit in his basement floor, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was sentenced to death and executed by lethal injection in July 1999.\nGary Heidnik was born on November 22, 1943, in Eastlake, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, to Michael and Ellen Heidnik. He had a younger brother, Terry. After their parents divorced in 1946, the Heidnik children were raised by their mother for four years before being placed in the care of their father and his new wife.[1] Heidnik would later claim he was emotionally abused by his father. He suffered a lifelong problem of bed wetting and said his father would humiliate him by forcing him to hang his stained sheets from his bedroom window, in full view of their neighbors. After his son's arrest, Heidnik's father denied the abuse allegations.[2][3]\nAt school, Heidnik did not interact with his fellow students and refused to make eye contact. When a well-meaning, new female student asked, \"Did you get the homework done, Gary?\", he yelled at her, and told her she was not \"worthy enough\" to talk to him. Heidnik was also teased about his oddly shaped head, which he and Terry claimed was the result of a young Heidnik falling out of a tree. Nonetheless, Heidnik performed well academically and tested with an I.Q. of 148.[4][3] With the encouragement of his father, 14-year-old Heidnik enrolled at the Staunton Military Academy in Staunton, Virginia, for two years, leaving before graduation. After another period in public high school, he dropped out and joined the United States Army when he was 17.[5]\nHeidnik served in the Army for thirteen months. During basic training, his drill sergeant graded him as \"excellent.\" He applied for several specialist positions, including the military police, but was rejected. He was sent to San Antonio, Texas to be trained as a medic, and did well through medical training. However, he did not stay in San Antonio very long and was transferred to the 46th Army Surgical Hospital in Landstuhl, West Germany. Within weeks of his new posting in Germany, he earned his GED. In August 1962, Heidnik began complaining of severe headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, and nausea. A hospital neurologist diagnosed Heidnik with gastroenteritis and noted that he also displayed symptoms of mental illness, for which he was prescribed trifluoperazine. In October 1962, Heidnik was transferred to a military hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he was diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder and consequently honorably discharged from military service.\nShortly after his discharge, Heidnik became a licensed practical nurse and enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania, only to drop out after a single semester. He worked at a Veterans Administration hospital in Coatesville, but was fired for poor attendance and rude behavior towards patients. From August 1962 until his arrest in March 1987, Heidnik spent time in and out of psychiatric hospitals and had attempted suicide at least thirteen times. In 1970, his mother who had been diagnosed with bone cancer and was suffering the effects of alcoholism, committed suicide by drinking mercuric chloride.[6] His brother Terry also spent time in mental institutions, and attempted suicide multiple times.[2]\nIn October 1971, Heidnik incorporated a church called the \"United Church of the Ministers of God\", initially with a mere five followers. In 1975, he opened an account under the church's name with Merrill Lynch. The initial deposit was $1,500. Heidnik eventually amassed over $500,000 (over US$2.7 million in 2023). By 1986, the United Church of the Ministers of God was prosperous and opulent.[3]\nHeidnik used a matrimonial service to meet his future wife, Betty Disto, with whom he corresponded by mail for two years before proposing to her. Disto arrived from the Philippines in September 1985 and married Heidnik in Maryland the following month, on October 3. The marriage rapidly deteriorated after she caught him abed with a trio of other women. Throughout the course of their brief marriage, Heidnik forced his wife to be an onlooker while he performed intercourse with other women.[7] Disto also accused Heidnik of repeatedly raping and assaulting her. With the help of the Filipino community in Philadelphia, she was able to leave Heidnik in January 1986.[8] Unknown to Heidnik until his ex-wife requested child support payments in 1987, he had impregnated Disto during their short marriage. On September 15, 1986, she gave birth to a son, whom she named Jesse John Disto.[9]\nHeidnik also had a child with Gail Lincow, a son named Gary Jr.[10] The child was placed in foster care soon after his birth. Heidnik had a third child with another woman, Anjeanette Davidson, who was illiterate and mentally disabled.[11] Their daughter, Maxine Davidson, was born on March 16, 1978, and immediately placed in foster care. Shortly after Maxine's birth, Heidnik was arrested for the kidnapping and rape of Anjeanette's sister, Alberta, who had been living in an institution for the mentally disabled in Penn Township.\nIn 1976, Heidnik was charged with aggravated assault and carrying an unlicensed pistol after shooting at the tenant of a house he offered for rent, grazing the man's face.\n",

        "paragraph": "Aimee Ellen Willard (June 8, 1974 \u2013 June 20, 1996) was a college lacrosse player who was murdered by Arthur Bomar near Philadelphia on her way home from a night out with friends. Her car was left running, with the lights on and driver's side door open, on the Exit 5 off-ramp of Interstate 476. Her body was found the next day in North Philadelphia, 17 miles away. She had been beaten to death with a tire iron. The beating was so savage that her skull had multiple fractures.[2] The then-unsolved crime was featured on Unsolved Mysteries and later as a solved one on Cold Case Files and The New Detectives. The story of her murder and investigation was also featured on an episode of Forensic Files as well as in the film The Dark Side of Parole.\nThe case went cold for nearly two years when many theories and suspects were investigated.[3] The case was re-opened when another woman in Pennsylvania was hit from behind while driving alone at night. The other vehicle's driver tried to get her to stop, but the woman refused and instead memorized his license plate number. That plate was registered to Arthur Bomar, but the car belonged to Maria Cabuenos, another Pennsylvania woman who had been reported missing in March 1998. Bomar's actual car was later found at a junkyard. The burn pattern found on Willard's back was consistent with the oil pan on the bottom of Bomar's car. Moreover, Willard's blood and hair were found in Bomar\u2019s car.\nWith DNA evidence, Arthur Bomar was identified as Willard's killer. He was an ex-convict convicted of second-degree murder in 1979 in Nevada; he was paroled 11 years later.[4] Bomar had repeatedly violated his parole but was never returned to Nevada to finish his sentence, due to that state's failure to arrange and finance extradition.\nBomar was convicted of first-degree murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, and abuse of a corpse and was sentenced to death.[5][6]  He was never charged with the murder of Maria Cabuenos, whose skeletal remains were found after his conviction.[7] It is theorized that on the night of her murder, Bomar hit Willard's car in order to force her to pull over. Bomar, to this day, denies any role in the crimes, claiming he was a target of racism.[8]\nWillard was a star lacrosse player at the Academy of Notre Dame de Namur in Villanova, Pennsylvania, and later at George Mason University from 1994 to 1996 (the first three seasons in program history). In 1996, Willard led the Colonial Athletic Association in scoring fifty goals and twenty-nine assists in lacrosse. She was named to the All-Conference Team in both soccer and lacrosse,[9] and to the All-American team for the Southeast region in lacrosse that year. In total, she scored 96 goals and recorded 36 assists for the lacrosse team. At the end of the 1996 season (her third), she held the school records for most goals in a game (7), most goals in a season (50), career goals, most points in a game (8), most points in a season (68), and most career points (132).[10] US Lacrosse has created a national award in her honor.[11]\nBecause of the bureaucratic issues which allowed Bomar to remain free to commit these crimes, The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (H.R. 3244), better known as \"Aimee's Law,\" was passed by the US Congress by a vote of 90\u20135 in 2000 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 28, 2000. It encourages states to keep murderers, rapists, and child molesters behind bars and holds the state financially accountable if it fails. It allows interstate parole violators to be jailed in their state of residence at the expense of the state where the original offense was committed. It allows offenders to be jailed in another state if circumstances allow.[12][13]\nA small roadside memorial on the exit ramp from Interstate 476 to southbound U.S. Route 1 marks the site where Willard's car was found.\n",

Howe's kidnapping and killing by being thrown from a bridge became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in Pennsylvania, receiving widespread media attention for over a decade.     \nIn September/October 2005, Eldred \u201cTed\u201d Walker, James O'Brien, and Timothy O'Brien were convicted for participation in Shauna Howe's murder.\nAround 8pm on October 27, Howe was walking home from a Girl Scouts Halloween party in Oil City, Pennsylvania, when she was abducted at the corner of West First Street and Reed Street, two blocks from home.[1][2] A local resident, Dan Paton, witnessed the kidnapping, providing investigators with details of the circumstances, the abductor and the getaway vehicle used.[3]\nTwo days later, investigators found a piece of Howe's gymnastic costume near an abandoned railroad bed in a rural, wooded area in the nearby township of Rockland, which was identified by her stepfather as being Shauna's. The next morning, Howe's body was found about 200 yards from where the clothing was found, along with a candy wrapper and her shoes. Howe's abductors had thrown her alive from a railroad trestle bridge into a dry, rocky creek bed near Coulter's Hole in Rockland, and she had died of blunt force trauma to the head and chest caused by the fall.\nThe mystery of Howe's disappearance and murder continued for nearly ten years until the investigation had a major breakthrough. In 2002, a DNA sample taken from Oil City resident James O'Brien, who was serving a prison sentence for attempting to kidnap an Oil City woman in 1995, matched a sample of seminal DNA found on Howe's body in tests run by the FBI lab in Washington, D.C. O\u2019Brien had not been a suspect earlier as investigators mistakenly believed he was in jail at the time of the attack, and neither of the brothers fit the eyewitness description.\nThe DNA revelation intensified the investigation, with increased presence in the area by the FBI and the Pennsylvania State Police, with the latter searching the home of Eldred \"Ted\" Walker, who said he may have opened his home to some \"really bad\" people once who may have done \"a disgusting thing.\"[1] An early suspect, Walker and one of his vehicles had resembled those provided by the witness, but the investigation at the time stalled as his DNA did not match.\nIn September 2005, Walker, as part of a plea bargain, pleaded guilty to kidnapping and third degree murder and agreed to testify against the O'Brien brothers. In court, he admitted grabbing Howe and passing her to the O\u2019Briens who were waiting in a parked car. He also admitted knowing the brothers were upstairs in his house with the girl as he heard her crying.[4] He, however, denied any involvement in her death.\nOn what would be the eve of the 13 year anniversary of Shauna's disappearance, the O'Brien brothers learned their fate.\nAfter nearly 17 hours of deliberations, the Indiana County jury had come to a  verdict.\nIn the end, the jury found the brothers; guilty of second degree murder, guilty of third-degree murder, guilty of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, and guilty of kidnapping and criminal conspiracy to commit kidnapping.\nThe brother's convictions for second degree murder (otherwise known as felony murder) carries a mandatory lifetime sentence without the possibility of parole.\nSecond degree murder is not considered premeditated, instead the law categorizes it as a murder which occurs during the commission of a felony crime (such as a kidnapping).\n",

        "paragraph": "\nMurder in Pennsylvania constitutes the intentional killing, under circumstances defined by law, of people within or under the jurisdiction of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania.\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in the year 2020, the state had a murder rate somewhat above the median for the entire country.[1]\nPennsylvania was the first state to differentiate the crime of \"murder\" into degrees based upon the culpability of the perpetrator.[2]  The most significant departure was the division of murder into degrees, a change initiated by the Pennsylvania legislation of 1794.\").  Dressler goes onto explain that \"[o]ther states followed the Pennsylvania practice until at one time the vast majority of American jurisdictions differentiated degrees of murder and the term 'first-degree murder' passed into common parlance.\"\nUp until the 1960s, the common law definition of 'murder' was intentional homicide with malice aforethought; i.e. it was codified without respect to distinct elements as it is today.  First degree murder in this epoch of criminal law, and in Pennsylvania at the time the statute of 1794 was ratified, was reserved for intentional homicide whereby the conduct was 'willful', 'deliberate', or 'premeditated'.  The interesting point to note is that the assignment of either a first degree or second degree charge was not mandated by the common law (or the statute); that is, the decision to try a defendant for intentional homicide, in either the first or second degree was left solely in the hands of the jury.  Later, in the 20th century, this became problematic in cases involving capital punishment.  Because the assignment of first (or second) degree murder to a given defendant was, in a sense, randomly chosen by the jury rather than adhered to by a strict set of codes or defined elements of a crime, the argument, asserting that the levying of a capital punishment in the absence of given set of procedures fundamentally conflicted with the notions embodied by due process, gained prominence, and the constitutional legitimacy of capital punishment for certain offenses or offenders was challenged in subsequent Supreme Court cases.\nIn the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, common law felony murder was codified as \"Murder of the Second Degree.\"[3]  The statute provides that \"[c]riminal homicide constitutes murder of the second degree when it is committed while defendant was engaged as a principal or an accomplice in the perpetration of a felony.\"[3]\nThe Pennsylvania formulation narrows the doctrine.  Indeed, \"Perpetration of a Felony\" is statutorily defined as\nA killing caused during the perpetration of a felony that is not otherwise listed in \u00a7 2502(d), i.e. aggravated assault, would be charged as Murder of the Third Degree or as a less culpable homicide provision, e.g. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2503 (Manslaughter).\n",

Sindone had previously served time for narcotics trafficking and was heavily involved in illegal gambling within the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Sindone also operated in concert with Philadelphia family associate, Harry D'Ascenzo, who had ties to mobsters in Baltimore. Sindone was made into the Philadelphia family in the early 1970s together with Joseph Ciancaglini. They were the last mob associates to be made into the family under Bruno.\nIn 1980, Sindone joined forces with consigliere Antonio Caponigro, capo John Simone from Newark, New Jersey, and Frank Tieri, the boss of the New York Genovese crime family, in a plan to overthrow Bruno.\nTheir motive for killing Bruno stemmed from a money dispute. Tieri had recently demanded a larger percentage of the revenues from Caponigro's two million dollar bookmaking operation in Hudson County, New Jersey. Bruno opposed giving Tieri this extra money and pleaded his family's case to the Mafia Commission. The Commission sided with Bruno and refused Tieri's request. \nHowever, Tieri was still determined to take over Caponigro's bookmaking operation. Learning that Caponigro was planning to overthrow Bruno, Tieri told Caponigro that he would get the Commission's approval for the hit and provide other assistance. Tieri never went to the Commission, but he nevertheless told Caponigro he had the Commission's blessing. On March 21, 1980, an unknown gunman, believed to have been Caponigro's cousin Alfred Salerno, shot and killed Bruno in his car.\nAfter Bruno's assassination, Sindone's plan was to become underboss of the Philadelphia family with Caponigro as boss. However, less than a month later, Caponigro and his cousin were found stuffed in the trunks of two cars a few miles apart in the South Bronx section of New York City. On September 17, 1980, John Simone was found dead. On October 29, 1980, Frank Sindone was found dead in an alley behind a variety store in South Philadelphia, shot three times in the head. \nAll indications were that the Mafia Commission had murdered all four men in retribution for the unsanctioned murder of Bruno.\n",

All they did was run, and they shooting at them.\"[sic] [3] Police said that Rose had been unarmed when he was shot.[17] Hester escaped, but was later arrested.[18]\nHester was charged with the drive by shooting.[19] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published video footage showing Rose in the front passenger seat of a Chevrolet Cruze, while Hester fired through the rear window behind him. Contradicting that video evidence, drive-by victim William Ross told investigators on January 17, 2019 that Rose was in fact the individual who had shot him: \"The beef was between me and him, that car came by, he shot me, I ran to the store.\"[20]\n",

        "paragraph": "Salvatore \"Salvie\" Testa (March 31, 1956 \u2013 September 14, 1984), nicknamed \"The Crowned Prince of the Philadelphia Mob\", was an Italian-American mobster who served as a caporegime and later acting underboss for the Philadelphia crime family. Testa made his reputation as a hitman for the Philadelphia family during a period of internal gang conflict. The son of former boss Philip \u201cThe Chicken Man\u201d Testa, Salvatore Testa was an emerging figure in the mob until he was killed on the orders of boss Nicodemo Scarfo.\nBorn on March 31, 1956, in Southwest Philadelphia, Testa was the son of Alfia Arcidiacono (1926\u20131980) and Philip \"Chicken Man\" Testa (1924\u20131981), a member of the Philadelphia family that served under Angelo Bruno. In 1974 he graduated from Saint John Neumann High School and he attended Temple University in Philadelphia for a year, and then went into the real estate business. Testa had one sister, Maria, who managed a Center City nightclub and restaurant. In March 1980, longtime family boss Angelo Bruno was murdered and Testa's father became boss. The death of Bruno triggered a violent civil war in the family between factions loyal to Harry Riccobene and Nicodemo Scarfo, who controlled the family's Atlantic City operations.\nOn March 15, 1981, Testa's father returned to his home in South Philadelphia that was across the street from the scenic Stephen Girard Park. As he was opening the door to his home, a nail bomb exploded under his front porch.[1] His death was allegedly ordered by his underboss and drug trafficker Peter Casella and capo Frank Narducci Sr., which later resulted in Narducci being gunned down and Casella being banished from the Mob and fleeing to Florida.\nScarfo took over the crime family following Philip Testa's death, and he promoted Salvatore Merlino to underboss. On July 31, 1982, Salvatore Testa was wounded near his home in the Italian Market section by shotgun blasts fired from a speeding car.[2] In 1984, Testa broke off his engagement to Merlino's daughter. Enraged, Merlino got permission from Scarfo to murder Testa, despite him being a loyal member of the crime family. However, Merlino developed a drinking problem, which caused Scarfo to demote Merlino and cut off ties with him.\nIn 1984, Scarfo ordered the death of Testa, one of his capos and his top hitman, as Testa's ambition and growing popularity made Scarfo feel threatened.[3] On September 14, 1984, Testa was found shot to death at the side of a road in Gloucester Township, New Jersey.[4] About 300 people attended Testa's funeral procession on September 20, 1984, at St. Paul's Catholic Church in Philadelphia's Italian Market section.[5] He was interred alongside his father, Philip, and mother, Alfia, at the family plot at Holy Cross Cemetery in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.\nAs a result of Salvatore Testa's murder, Scarfo gained a reputation for disloyalty, and several criminal organizations across the United States began to distrust him.[6]\n",

The memorial is located in Stonycreek Township in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, and is 78 miles (126\u00a0km) southeast of Pittsburgh and 226 miles (364\u00a0km) west of Philadelphia.\nA national memorial was created to honor the passengers and crew of Flight 93, who stopped the terrorists from reaching their target by fighting the hijackers. A temporary memorial to the 40 victims was established soon after the crash. The first phase of the permanent memorial was completed, opened, and dedicated on September 10, 2011.[2] The design for the memorial is a modified version of the entry Crescent of Embrace by Paul and Milena Murdoch.\nA concrete and glass visitor center opened on September 10, 2015,[2] situated on a hill overlooking the crash site and the white marble Wall of Names.[3] An observation platform at the visitor center and the white marble wall are both aligned beneath the path of Flight 93.[3][4]\nOf the four aircraft hijacked on September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 is the only one that did not reach the hijackers\u2019 intended target, presumed to be the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C.[5] Several passengers and crew members made cellular telephone calls from the plane and learned about the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. As a result, the passengers and crew members decided to mount an assault in order to retake control of the aircraft from the hijackers. The plane crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Washington, D.C., killing all 44 passengers and crew members, including the four terrorists.\nThe crash site was enclosed by a fence and closed to the public except for victims' family members. The temporary memorial was located on a hillside 500 yards (450 meters) from the crash site. The memorial included a 40-foot (12\u00a0m) chain-link fence\u00a0\u2013 its length commemorating the 40 passengers and crew\u00a0\u2013 on which visitors could leave flowers, flags, hats, rosaries, and other items. The items were collected by the National Park Service.[7]\nMany cities wanted to memorialize the heroes of United Flight 93. Among the first was Marshall, Texas, which by order of the City Commission, named a street \"United Flight 93\" in early 2002. The keynote speaker was Barbara Catuzzi, the mother of victim Lauren Grandcolas.[8]\nNext to the fence were several memorials including a bronze plaque of names, flags, and a large cross. The temporary memorial also included a row of small wooden angels, one for each passenger or crew member. There were also handwritten messages on the guardrails at the memorial.[7] At the memorial site, there was also a small building where visitors could sign a guestbook. The building was staffed by National Park Service volunteers, called ambassadors, who answered questions. In the years following the attacks, approximately 150,000 visitors each year came to the memorial site,[9] a number that reached nearly a million people as of July 2008.[10]\nThe temporary memorial, for years on land leased for the memorial by Svonavec, Inc., a coal company based in Somerset, Pennsylvania, was moved in 2008 because the company did not renew the lease.[10] It was moved across the road on land that is part of about 900 acres (360 hectares) that the Families of Flight 93 foundation bought in 2008.[10]\n",

Operated by Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, it was named after the phoenix bird.[3]\nBuilt for $400 million, making it the state prison built for the highest cost in Pennsylvania history,[4][5] it has a capacity of 3,830 prisoners,[6] and as of September 2018, its full time workforce numbered 1,200.[7] Heery International designed the facility.[8] It replaced SCI Graterford.[9] Most prisoners are male, located in the East and West sub units,[3] while it has a re-entry unit for female prisoners with a capacity of 192.[7]\nThe female unit is not in the main prison perimeter.[3] SCI Phoenix houses some men who are sentenced to death under Pennsylvania law.[10] The department of PA Corrections anticipated that most of the prisoners would be from the area of Philadelphia, and currently SCI Phoenix is the state prison closest to Philadelphia.[11]\nThe SCI Phoenix buildings were built on the SCI Graterford land area, and the Phoenix and Graterford buildings are about 0.25\u00a0mi (0.40\u00a0km) apart, with SCI Phoenix fencing beginning about 1,100 feet east of SCI Graterford's fencing.[12][13]\nThe first bidding for construction of this prison occurred in the decade of the 2000s. The prison, originally to open in November 2014, opened late since Walsh Heery Joint Venture, the construction company, and Hill International, a Philadelphia company representing the State of Pennsylvania, had a dispute over whether the prison was ready to open. As of July 2018[update], the prison's final cost was still not finalized.[14]\nOn June 1, 2018, its dedication ceremony was held, and the prison began operations on July 9, 2018.[2] The state began moving Graterford prisoners there on July 11, 2018, and Graterford ended operations on July 15.[15] Graterford's employees now were employees of Phoenix.[5] Some inmates disliked the move as they feared they would be sharing cells with other inmates, while at Graterford they had single cells.[16]\nThe population of Graterford was to reduce to 2,588 inmates by June 2018,[17] so that the transfer of inmates to Phoenix would not involve as many people, and Phoenix eventually opened, with 2,633 prisoners. Initially, prisoners with life sentences who had single cells at Graterford would continue to have single cells at Phoenix.[14]\nMany prisoners are two to a cell, and most cells have the dimensions 12\u00a0ft (3.7\u00a0m) by 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m).[18] Phoenix has 3,422 beds.[8]\nIt has inmates convicted of capital murder, many from the Philadelphia area and most of whom were sentenced to life imprisonment but with some under death sentences, housed in a dedicated section of the prison, called the \"Capital Unit.\" That section is larger than the previous capital case section that was in Graterford. \n",

        "paragraph": "Anthony Joyner (born May 26, 1962) is an American serial killer and rapist who raped and murdered at least six elderly women at a nursing home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from January to July 1983, but is suspected in 18 total deaths that occurred there. Tried and convicted only for his confirmed murders, he was sentenced to life imprisonment.[1]\nVery little is known about Joyner's early life. Born on May 25, 1962, in Philadelphia, he was considered portly and physically weak as a teenager, but otherwise had no problems with communication or was not ostracized by his peers. Because of his physique, Joyner had little success with women and was not popular in the neighborhood, with some friends and acquaintances suspecting him of being homosexual, which he vehemently denied.[2]\nAs he failed to receive higher education, Joyner resorted to doing low-skilled labor and made a living off odd jobs. In October 1981, he got a position as an assistant nutritionist in the kitchen of the Philadelphia's Kearsley Home, Christ Church Hospital, at the time the oldest operating institution of its kind in the country. While working there, Joyner was regarded well by both staff and patients, who all said that he had a friendly, talkative, and energetic demeanor, and showed great affection for the elderly patients.[2]\nAs victims, Joyner would choose elderly female residents of the nursing home, aged between 83 and 92. On January 12, 1983, 92-year-old Margaret Eckard was found dead, and despite finding traces of blood around her nose, mouth, and genitals, the hospital staff concluded that she had died of natural causes. A month later, on February 12, 85-year-old Kathryn Maxwell's body was found in similar circumstances, followed by 86-year-old Elizabeth Monroe only a few days later. While examining the latter's body, medical personnel again found traces of blood and damage to her genitalia, but due to her advanced age and negligence on part of the staff, no autopsy was performed and the cause of death was ruled as a heart attack.[3]\nOn June 1, the body of 89-year-old Lily Amlie was discovered by nursing home workers. It also showed the same signs as the previous deaths, but because Amlie had heart issues, her death was not considered suspicious. On July 19, two women, 90-year-old Eugenia Borda and 83-year-old Mildred Alston were found dead. While examining Borda's body, the doctors found traces of blood and injuries on her thighs and genitals. Finding these injuries highly suspicious, he refused to declare the cause of death as natural and insisted that he performed an autopsy on both bodies, which revealed that both women had been raped, with Borda being strangled and Alston suffocated to death.[4] He reported his findings to the police, who immediately started an investigation into the matter.\nBecause the facility had its own security staff, the police had already developed a theory early on that an authorized person could not have entered the nursing home unnoticed, and that the killer was likely among the personnel. While interviewing staff members, investigators determined that on July 19, the day Borda and Alston were murdered, Joyner had been seen in the facility's cellar early in the morning.[5] Further investigation into his activities determined that he went inside the patients' rooms through the basement, and after raping and killing them, he would leave the area by the same route and return to work.[5]\nOn August 1, Joyner was apprehended by law enforcement, and in a subsequent interrogation, he unexpectedly confessed to killing both women and was subsequently charged with both murders.[6] According to investigators, Joyner expressed remorse and claimed that he wanted to make a full confession because he had trouble sleeping, while his attorney claimed that he was mentally ill and that the police had tricked his client into signing a pre-written confession.[7] Because a total of 18 suspicious deaths had occurred at the nursing home since Joyner was hired in October 1981, police began investigating him for possible involvement in other killings.[6]\nDuring the investigation, police obtained a warrant to exhume the bodies of Eckard, Maxwell, Amlie, and Monroe.[8] Autopsies were conducted on all four, with the rulings being that Maxwell and Monroe had been raped and strangled and that Amlie had been drowned in her bathtub.[4] As Eckard's body was too decomposed, the coroners were unable to determine her cause of death.[4] After learning of the autopsy results, Joyner confessed to the four murders, as well as a sexual assault committed on a 69-year-old woman on a Philadelphia street in July 1982, which the victim survived. The rape victim was found soon after and positively identified Joyner as her rapist, verifying his account. According to Joyner himself, it was this incident that provoked him to commit further crimes against older women, as they were unable to offer serious resistance.[4]\nWhen pressed for a motive, Joyner gave contradictory information: he insisted that due to certain reasons and circumstances he had no sex life, leaving him sexually frustrated.[9] And as he was unable to be intimate with girls his age, he was left in a state of anger that led to him raping and strangling the patients at the nursing home - he claimed to kill them only because they knew him well and could get him imprisoned.[9] Joyner's ex-girlfriend, who briefly had an intimate relationship with him, told police that he began to suffer from an inferiority complex after breaking up with her, growing increasingly worried about being labelled as gay, which prompted him to demonstrate his masculine behavior in every way possible. According to her testimony, Joyner wanted attention, as she claimed that a few days before his arrest, he had contacted her, claiming that he would soon become famous and be written about in the media.\n",

As a surgeon in the United States Naval Reserve, he received the Medal of Honor for his actions during World War I.\nPetty was born in Cadiz, Ohio on February 20, 1874. To Asbury Festus Petty and Sallie M Kyle. Orlando had a twin brother Orville A Petty and a younger sister Netta A Petty. He graduated from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia in 1904 and two years later joined the school's teaching staff. In 1908, he married Marcia P. Mellersh of Philadelphia; the couple had two children, Clara M. and Orville A. Petty.[1][2]\nPetty joined the U.S. Naval Reserve Force as a lieutenant, junior grade, in December 1916 and served in the Medical Corps. After the United States' entry into World War I, he was sent to France where he worked as an assistant surgeon. In March 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant.[3]\nBy June 11, 1918, Petty was attached to the 5th Marine Regiment as the unit took part in the Battle of Belleau Wood. On that day, his dressing station in Lucy-le-Bocage came under heavy fire from German artillery, some of which were firing poison gas shells. He continued to evacuate and treat the wounded, even after he was knocked to the ground and his gas mask rendered useless by an exploding shell. When the dressing station was destroyed, he personally carried wounded Captain Lloyd W. Williams to safety. Captain Williams was the Marine famously quoted as saying \"Retreat? Hell, we just got here!\" For these actions, Petty was awarded the Medal of Honor.[3]\nOther decorations which Petty received during the war include the Distinguished Service Cross, the Croix de Guerre with palm from France, and the Croce di Guerra from Italy.[2]\nAfter his military service, Petty returned to Philadelphia and resumed teaching medicine. From 1923 until shortly before his death, he was a professor of metabolic diseases at the University of Pennsylvania. He was also the personal physician of Philadelphia mayor Harry A. Mackey. In 1931, Mackey appointed him as the head of the city's public health department.[2]  Petty was a member of the Sons of the Revolution.\nOn June 2, 1932, Petty's family found him dead in the bedroom of his Philadelphia home. He had been shot through the heart, apparently with his military service pistol, which was found nearby. His family noted that he had been in poor health for some time; his death was ruled a suicide.[2] He is buried at Saint Timothy's Episcopal Church Cemetery in Philadelphia's Roxborough neighborhood.[3]\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer: Date: 6-3-1932, Pg.1 and 10: DR O H PETTY ENDS OWN LIFE EX-HEALTH HEAD - Director During Last Months of Mackey Regime Kills Self With Pistol - Found Dead at Home at 1803 Pine, Was World War Hero, One-time President of Medical Society: Dr Orlando H Petty former Director of the Public Health in the closing period of the Mackey administration, widely known physician and World War hero, hot and killed himself with a German Luger pistol, a war trophy, in a bedroom of his home at 1803 Pine St, shortly before six o'clock last night. He was 57 years of age.  Dr Petty and Dr Joel T Boone, personal physician to President Hoover, were the only physicians to be decorated with the Congressional Metal of Honor for heroic service during the World War. In additional to the Congressional decoration Dr Petty received other metals in recognition of his valor while under fire in a front-line dressing station during heavy fighting in June 1918.  The physician apparently entered his bedroom shortly after 5 P.M. yesterday. At about 5:45 P.M. he pressed the heavy Luger against his breast and pulled the trigger. A bullet ripped through his heart, killing him instantly.  SECRETARY FINDS BODY  The report was heard by Dr Petty's secretary, Miss Rose Cullen, of 608 Wynnewood Rd, Overbrook. She rushed to the bedroom to find the man dead. After notifying members of the family of the tragedy the young woman summoned the police and the coroner.  The body of Dr Petty was removed to Graduate Hospital for official verification of death. The remains were then removed to the morgue.  Detectives who talked to members of the family said that they were given to understand that Dr Petty had been in ill health. Despondency over his condition was the only motive the family could advance as a possible motive for his self-destruction.  In April 1931, Dr Petty was confined to Mt Sinai Hospital suffering from a complaint the nature of which was unrevealed.  Last September Dr Petty was appointed Director of the Department of Public Health to fill the vacancy created by the Dr A A Cairns. He also was person physician to Mayor Mackey and accompanied the latter on his European trip.  GRADUATE OF JEFFERSON Dr Petty was graduated from Franklin College, New Athens, Ohio in 1900, and from Jefferson Medical College in 1904 and served as an intern in St Timothy's Hospital. He was an associate surgeon with Dr John B Lowman, of Johnstown, for one year and then returned here and was connected with the teaching staff of Jefferson Medical College until 1923.  From 1923 until recently, Dr Petty was professor of disease of metabolism in the Graduate School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania.  He served under the late Dr Cairns as a medical inspector of the Board of Health of 1908 until after the World War. In 1924 he wrote a book on \"Diabetes and Its Treatment by Insulin and Diet.\" It recently reached its fifth edition. He also was author of many articles on scientific matters.  He was the author of an important work on \"Prevention of Communicable Respiratory Disease Based on Observations in Army Camps.\" He introduced insulin here after its discovery at the University of Toronto.  Dr Petty maintained offices at his home on Pine St. He shared his office with Drs Charles J Haines and John A Murphy.  He was a member of the Philadelphia County Medical Society, The Pennsylvania State Medical Society, a Fellow of the American Medical Association, the American College of Physicians, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and numerous other medical societies. SERVED WITH MARINES  On April 2, 1917, Dr Petty was assigned as captain to active duty as a surgeon of the United States Marine Corps. He sailed for France in August, 1917 and served with the Fifth Marines, Second Division. For \"valor in battle against an armed enemy of the United States\" Dr Petty received the following decorations: The Congressional Metal of Honor, the United States Distinguished Service Cross, French Croix de Guerre with palm and the Italian War Cross.  Dr Petty and Joel T Boone, personal physician to President Hoover, are the only physicians serving in the World War who received the Congressional Metal of Honor.  The act of heroism for which Dr Petty was honored occurred on June 11, 1918, while in fierce action with the Marines. Under heavy shell fire he worked in his frontline dressing station until the building literally fell in flames over him. He then managed to escape to a place of safety, carrying a wounded officer on his back.  FORMER MEDICAL SOCIETY HEAD He was severally gassed and was in a hospital for many days. he finally insisted upon being released from the hospital and immediately returned to front-line duty.  He served as physician to the Memorial Hospital, Roxborough, pathologist in that institution and also as pathologist to the Germantown Hospital. He was a past president of the Philadelphia County Medical Society and of the Medical Club of Philadelphia; a past national commander of the Army and Navy Legion of Valor and past commander of the Thomas Roberts Reath Post, No 186, American Legion.  In 1924 he was appointed physician in charge of the Department of Metabolism of the Philadelphia Hospital. In addition to being a member of several leading physicians' organizations he belonged to the Pennsylvania Society, Sons of the Revolution, Aesculapian and Manufacturers Clubs.  He also belonged to the University Club, Ocean City Golf Club and Lu Lu Temple Country Club. He was an Episcopalian by faith and a 32nd Degree Mason.  Dr Petty was born in Cadiz, O. In 1908 he married Miss Marcia P Mellersh of this city. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Miss Clara M Petty, and a son Orville A Petty, 2nd.\nPetty's official Medal of Honor citation reads:\n",

The 112\u00a0ft (34 m) bridge was located on Street Road near Pennsylvania Route 472. It was burnt and destroyed by an arsonist on March 19, 1979.  The covered bridge was also referred to as Bridge #11 by Chester County before it was replaced with the current steel beam bridge.\nThe Bellbank Covered Bridge was built in 1850 over the Octoraro Creek by Robert Russell (who also rebuilt the Pine Grove Covered Bridge in 1846[1]).  It was named after Revolutionary War Colonel James Patterson Bell, who had his home, gristmill, and sawmill located in the 1,200-acre (4.9\u00a0km2) plot of land where the bridge was built. In June 1860 the bridge caught on fire after being struck by lightning. Russell received a contract to rebuild the bridge at a cost of $1,739.\nSometime in the 1960s the bridge was scheduled to be destroyed, but was instead rehabilitated.  After it was destroyed by fire on March 19, 1979, the bridge, which was previously owned by Chester County, was finally replaced by an open steel-beam bridge after a failed petition to PennDOT by the community to rebuild it as a covered bridge. The fire was ruled as arson when a blackened gas can was found in the center of the burnt-out bridge. As of 2006, there is a movement to replace the current bridge with a replica of the original covered bridge.\n",

        "paragraph": "The 1927 Indiana bituminous strike was a strike by members of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) against local bituminous coal companies.  Although the struggle raged throughout most of the nation's coal fields, its most serious impact was in western Pennsylvania, including Indiana County.[1]  The strike began on April 1, 1927, when almost 200,000 coal miners struck the coal mining companies operating in the Central Competitive Field, [2] after the two sides (management and labor) could not reach an agreement on pay rates.  The UMWA was attempting to retain pay raises gained in the contracts it had negotiated in 1922 and 1924, while management, stating that it was under economic pressure from competition with the West Virginia coal mines, was seeking wage reductions.[3][4] The strike proved to be a disaster for the union, as by 1929, there were only 84,000 paying members of the union, down from 400,000 which belonged to the union in 1920.[1]\nThe coal industry in the United States was at the end of three decades of growth in 1920, during which production had increased five-fold.[1] The UMWA had won pay hikes and a shorter work day in 1919, and preserved these gains in contracts with mine operators in 1922 and 1924.  However demand, which had been artificially inflated during the World War, dropped off at the war's end.  This, combined with a stagnation of coal usage through conservation efforts during the 1920s led to efforts to reduce costs by the mine operators.[1]  Coal miners and the United Mine Workers faced an extended crisis as coal operators sought cost reductions and pressured unionized miners to accept wage cutbacks to below the previously agreed upon rate of $7.50 per day, and even to abandon the union.[5]\nIn 1921, miners had struck against the Clearfield Bituminous Coal Corporation in Rossiter, Pennsylvania.  The strike arose when the company began to require their employees to punch a time clock. The miners refused to comply, and were backed up by the UMWA, stating that the union's permission was required to enforce the time-clock requirement, in addition to the fact that no other mine in the district employed the use of a time clock.  The strike lasted approximately one month, and ended when work resumed with the time clock in use.[6] Northern coal mining operators, looking to reduce costs, blamed their weakened competitive position on the high and inflexible wage rates\nnegotiated by the union. Attempts to impose significant wage reductions, in some cases up to 50 percent, were met by a bitter strike in\n1922.[1][7] This strike was not only about wages, but over the concept of national versus district contracts.  The union wanted a national contract, while the mining operators wanted contracts by districts.[8]  That strike lasted five months, but led to the Jacksonville agreement in 1924, wherein miners were given a $7.50 per day rate which had been agree upon in the 1920 negotiations.[1]  When the northern operators continued to lose market share to their southern counterparts, they asked the union for a renegotiation of the Jacksonville scale. Union President John L. Lewis refused on the grounds that the industry was undergoing a needed adjustment which, when completed, would result in fewer men and fewer mines and a stable, more prosperous industry.[1]\nThe coal mining area around Pittsburgh had always been a difficult territory for the UMWA. The presence of the nonunion Connellsville\nand Westmoreland fields made it difficult for the union to hold its ground, and the diverse ethnic groups which comprised the work force made organization and collective action difficult. It was in this district where the operators took their first stand against the union. In August, 1925, the Pittsburgh Coal Company, largest in the district, closed down, rejected the Jacksonville agreement, and reopened on a nonunion basis. Numerous other companies followed its lead. In all, some 110 mines in Pennsylvania changed from union to nonunion operation during 1925.[1]  This led to another strike over wages in 1925, which also lasted five months.[9]\nThe expiration of the Jacksonville Agreement, as well as the widespread violation of its terms by operators, gave urgency to the issue of negotiating a new agreement in 1927. Union representatives were charged to negotiate the best possible wage agreement possible as long as there was no reduction in wages. In February 1927 the union representatives met with representatives of the mining operators in Miami. The operators requested a reduction of the Jacksonville scale as well as union acceptance of the principle that wages should be tied to the changing price of coal. No agreement was reached in Miami, which led the union leadership to begin planning for a nationwide strike. The American Federation of Labor, responding to a plea from John L. Lewis (the head of the UMWA), passed a resolution which called on its affiliated international unions to help the coal miners. When the Coolidge administration refused to intervene in the dispute, Secretary of Labor James J. Davis could not get the major coal operators to agree to go back to the negotiating table with the UMWA.[5]\nOn April 1, 1927, 40,000 coal miners struck in the Central Competitive Field, beginning the largest coal strike since 1922, they were supported by another 45,000 miners throughout Pennsylvania and over another 100,000 miners nationwide.[2][5][3]  The 1927 strike was one of the longest and most bitter strikes in Pennsylvania coal-industry history. The walk-out effectively closed down all mining activity in the bituminous fields of western Pennsylvania.[3]   As time passed, other miners joined the strike, particularly those who worked for the Clearfield Bituminous Coal Corporation, in Rossiter, Pennsylvania, which became the focal point for the entire strike.   \nFrom the outset the striking miners endured intense hardships.  The operators used strikebreakers, private police, injunctions, and many other antiunion tactics which had been developed during a century of industrial conflict in America. Owners also evicted 12,000 miners and their families from company housing between July and December, 1927.[1][3]  The miners in Rossiter began to agitate, marching to other mines and encouraging their workers to join the strike.[5]\nIn a major setback for the union, the company brought in strikebreakers and reopened the Rossiter mine in September,[3] on a non-union basis with most of its employees recruited from outside the district and paid on the lower 1917 scale.[5]  A further, and much greater setback for the unions occurred in November, when Judge Jonathan Langham, serving on the Court of Common Pleas of Indiana County, Pennsylvania, published several sweeping injunctions against the protesters, putting a halt to their collective activities.[5][3]  The injunction forbade picketing, marching or gathering for meetings or rallies. It prohibited the disbursement of union funds for use by striking miners. The order also forbade newspaper advertisements and other means of communication being used to aid the cause of the strikers and convincing miners to desist from work.[5]  But it was his final injunction which brought national attention to the conflict in Pennsylvania:  He issued a prohibition against singing hymns and holding church services on the last two pieces of property in Rossiter not owned by the mining operators:  lots owned by the Magyar Presbyterian Church situated directly opposite the mouth of the mine.[5][3][10]\nThe publicity spawned by Langham's injunction attracted out-of-state journalists, and a United States Senate investigating committee that came to Rossiter in February 1928. The senators, who included Senator Robert Wagner of New York, heard testimony from Rossiter miners, company officials, and Langham, and pointedly questioned the judge and company attorneys about the injunction's marker denial of civil liberties and free speech. The company continued to import strikebreakers and rely on Coal and Iron Police, and by the end of August virtually every Rossiter-area mine operated on a non-union basis. In October 1928 the national strike officially ended in a major defeat for the UMWA.[3]\n",

Between 1949 and 1968, eight of the ten Noe children died of mysterious causes which were then attributed to sudden infant death syndrome.[2] All eight children were healthy at birth and were developing normally. Two other children died of natural causes. Noe pleaded guilty in June 1999 to eight counts of second-degree murder, and was sentenced to 20 years' probation and psychiatric examination.\nNoe was born Marie Lyddy on August 23, 1928, in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia to Ella (n\u00e9e Ackler) and James Lyddy. Marie was one of several children born of her parents' troubled marriage. Marie contracted scarlet fever at age five, which she later credited as the cause of learning difficulties. She dropped out of school as a young teenager to work and help care for a niece, born to one of her older sisters when Marie was 12 and raised as Marie's sister.[3]\nMarie Lyddy and Arthur Allen Noe (1921\u20132009) met at a private club in the West Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. On June 1, 1948, after a brief courtship, the couple eloped.[3] The couple proceeded to have ten children, all of whom died between the ages of five days and 14 months.\nDuring the Caesarean birth of her last child, Noe had a uterine rupture and underwent a hysterectomy.[3]\nIn 1963 Life magazine published a sympathetic article on Noe, written by Mary Cadwalader and using the pseudonyms Martha and Andrew Moore for Noe and her husband, after six of Noe's children had died.[4][5]\nInterest in the case was renewed after the publication of the 1997 book The Death of Innocents, about New York woman Waneta Hoyt, and an investigative article (Cradle to Grave by Stephen Fried) that appeared in the April 1998 issue of Philadelphia magazine.\nStephen Fried turned over his investigation results to the Philadelphia Police Department in March 1998. Upon questioning by police after receiving the material, Noe admitted to suffocating four of her children. She stated that she could not remember what happened to the other four children who died under similar circumstances. She was charged with first-degree murder in August 1998.[6]\nA plea agreement was reached in which Noe admitted to eight counts of second-degree murder and she was sentenced in June 1999 to 20 years of probation with the first five years under house arrest.\nAs a condition of her plea agreement, Noe agreed to psychiatric study in hopes of identifying what caused her to kill her children. In September 2001, a study was filed with the court which stated Noe had a mixed-personality disorder with avoidant, dependent, narcissistic, histrionic, borderline, paranoid and antisocial features.[7]\n",

It was organized in 1868 in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, with John Siney as president. In 1869, the organization called a strike of coal-miners from May 5 to June 16. There were some gains resulting from the strike.[1] The union was organized in an area of alleged[2] Molly Maguires activity.[3]\nStrikes were called in 1868, 1869, and 1871.[4] Two unarmed strikers were shot and killed in Scranton during the 1871 strike by mine owners' guards.\nJohn Siney also headed[5] the Miners' and Laborers' Benevolent Association. The Miners' and Laborers' Benevolent Association was formed in 1870, and in 1872 it became a national union in the bituminous fields of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and Michigan. The Miners' and Laborers' Benevolent Association was crushed in 1875.[6] Pennsylvania Industrialist Franklin B. Gowen forced a strike in January 1875 that came to be known as the Long Strike.[7] The strike lasted six months, and resulted in the destruction of the union.\nAn earlier organization, the Workingmen's Benevolent Society of Carbon County was organized in the Schuylkill region in 1864.[8]  The Workingmen's Benevolent Association was the name under which the anthracite coal fields were organized. In 1870 the Pennsylvania state legislature gave the society a charter (as a labor union) and the name was changed to the Miners and Laborers\u2019 Benevolent Association, but it continued to be called, except officially, by its prior name\u2014the Workingmen's Benevolent Association.[9]\nThis article related to a United States labor union is a stub.

        "paragraph": "Laurie Show was a 16-year-old sophomore at Conestoga Valley High School who was stalked by her classmates and murdered on December 20, 1991, in the United States. Her body was discovered in her Lancaster, Pennsylvania, home by her mother Hazel Show with her throat having been slit.[2] Her classmates Lisa Michelle Lambert, Tabitha Buck, and Lawrence \"Butch\" Yunkin were all subsequently charged with her murder.\nLambert initially began harassing Show in 1991, after learning that Show had briefly dated Yunkin over the summer. Lambert and Yunkin had a previous relationship, but had reportedly not been dating during the time Yunkin was dating Show. Show and Yunkin had gone on a few dates, with Show reporting to her mother that Yunkin had date raped her.[3] Shortly after his final date with Show, Yunkin resumed dating Lambert, who was pregnant with his child. Reported to be \"obsessively jealous\" of Show, Lambert proceeded to harass Show in various ways, such as appearing at Show's job and verbally assaulting her.[4] Witnesses reported that Lambert had expressed an intent to \"scare Laurie, then hurt her, then slit her throat\".[5]\nOn December 20, 1991, Laurie Show was discovered, fatally wounded, in her home by her mother. Police later recorded that Show had received \"a five-inch gash to the throat; a stab wound that punctured a lung and another that grazed her spine; several wounds to the head; and a number of defensive wounds\". An autopsy showed that Show's left common carotid artery had been severed. [6] Hazel Show was not at home at the time of the attack, having been duped by the killers into going to the high school to speak to a guidance counselor.[7] Show's mother reported to the police that her daughter had named Lambert as her killer, saying, \"Michelle did it\". Shortly after, Show bled to death. [8]\nPolice arrested Lambert, Yunkin, and Lambert's friend, Tabitha Buck, at a local bowling alley later that day for the murder of Show. While in police custody, the detectives and police take notes and photographs of all three suspects. The police and detectives notice that Lisa Michelle Lambert has not one defensive wound on her, while Tabitha Buck had many, including fresh scratch marks on her face and scratch marks in her right shoulder. Lawrence Yunkin also had a few defensive wounds. For such a violent crime against Laurie Show, all three suspects should've had defensive wounds but Lisa Lambert had none. [9] Initial statements from the three claimed that Yunkin had dropped Lambert and Buck off at Show's house, where the two girls murdered Show. Yunkin stated that he had not participated in the murder, and that, while he was aware that Lambert and Buck planned to cut Show's hair with the knife as a prank, he did provide them with an alibi, as well as helping to dispose of evidence.[10] Lambert and Buck would later recant their initial statements, with Lambert claiming that an abusive Yunkin had encouraged her to harass and assault Show.[6]\nA few weeks after the crime, an earring back was found in the room of Laurie Show , which was found to belong to Lawrence Yunkin. This evidence was turned over the police and was eventually somehow lost in evidence.\nLambert, Buck, and Yunkin were each tried for the murder of Laurie Show. Yunkin agreed to testify against Lambert, stating that she and Buck had slit Show's throat after the two had punctured one of Show's lungs.[11] A pair of sweatpants Lambert had worn during the crime were entered into evidence by the prosecution, as Show's blood was present on them.[12] Another exhibit was a letter from Lambert to Yunkin, in which Lambert states, \"I know I'm not an angel, but Lawrence, I never got mad enough to kill.\"[11]\nLambert was convicted on July 20, 1992 of first-degree murder and criminal conspiracy in the death of Show.[13] Buck was convicted of similar charges, and both young women were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[14]\nLambert was initially incarcerated at Cambridge Springs State Correctional Institution, while Buck was sent to Muncy State Correctional Institution.[15] Yunkin received a lesser sentence for his testimony and was granted parole in 2003.[16]\nLambert appealed the 1992 conviction, and in 1997, appeared in court for a federal habeas corpus hearing.[12] U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell presided over the trial. Lambert's lawyers claimed there were several inconsistencies with the evidence and testimony given in the earlier trial, and that Lambert was innocent. Lambert claimed she had been framed by Lancaster police officers in order to keep her from coming forward with charges that they had gang-raped her.[17]\nA huge amount of Evidence provided at the hearing included the sweatpants entered into the 1992 proceeding as well as correspondence between Yunkin and Lambert where Yunkin admits in his own handwriting that he and Tabitha Buck killed Laurie Show and asked Lambert to take blame for him, because she'll get less time because she is a female. While understand the police and prosecutors consistently contradicted themselves and their story. While on the stand a police officer stated that he never found a pink trash bag which would prove with evidence of Lawrence Yunkin proving he was involved in the crime. A video tape was shown of this officer on the stand finding the pink trash bag with the evidence. Another key point in that the murder victim's mother Hazel show told the judge that she had in fact seen Lawrence yunkin at the crime scene on the morning of the murder and had in fact told police this and the police told Miss hazel show not to worry about it.  Dalzell overturned the murder conviction on April 15, 1997, citing that \"prosecutorial misconduct\" had resulted in an incorrect ruling.[6] Dalzell also barred the state of Pennsylvania from re-trying Lambert.[12] Dalzell's ruling was later overturned in January 1998 by a federal appeals panel that stated that Lambert had \"not yet exhausted her appeals in state court\" and Lambert was taken back to prison.[18]\n",

        "paragraph": "John Charles Eichinger (born February 18, 1972) is an American serial killer who was convicted of killing three women and one child from 1999 to 2005 in Pennsylvania, which he committed after two of the victims had rejected his romantic advances. He was handed three death sentences for the latter murders and one life sentence for the former and is currently awaiting execution.[1][2]\nJohn Charles Eichinger was born on February 18, 1972, in Malvern, Pennsylvania, as one of four brothers.[3] He attended the Upper Merion Area High School in King of Prussia, where he was part of a large group of friends who would play Dungeons & Dragons in their spare time.[4] Through this activity, he became acquainted with Jennifer Still and Heather Greaves, developing a romantic interest in both women. After graduation, he found work as a clerk at a local Acme supermarket, where he worked alongside Greaves. He was noted for playing in local chess tournaments in his spare time.[5]\nOn July 6, 1999, Eichinger, donning a pair of rubber gloves and carrying a large knife under his jacket, went to Still's home in Bridgeport to confess his feelings towards her.[6] To his dismay, she rejected his advances, stating that she would not leave her fianc\u00e9. Enraged by her rejection, Eichinger pulled out the knife and repeatedly stabbed her, ultimately cutting her throat before leaving the house.[6] In the subsequent investigations, police questioned Still's boyfriend and friends, including Eichinger, who claimed that he had been in New Jersey at the time of the murders. In an attempt to ward the police off his trail, he claimed that two other Dungeons & Dragons players might have information about the murder, with one being heavily involved in Wicca. As the investigators had no evidence to connect him with the murder at the time, they focused on the players mentioned by Eichinger, until a DNA swab proved that they were innocent.[1]\nAfter the murder, Eichinger stored the bloodied knife, clothing, and rubber gloves he had worn on the day of the murder in his room as a keepsake to remind him of the killing. For the next five years, when Halloween came about, he would take out the knife and don a mask of Ghostface from the horror franchise Scream, and would go out trick-or-treating with them.[6] Around 2003, he moved to his parent's new home in Somers Point, New Jersey, where he transferred to work at a local Acme supermarket.[5]\nOn March 25, 2005, Greaves ordered some purple flowers for her upcoming birthday and arranged for Eichinger to deliver them at her home in King of Prussia. Bringing the knife with him, Eichinger went to the house and confessed his feelings for Greaves. After being rejected again, he pulled out the knife and started stabbing her before finishing her off by slitting her throat.[6] The act was noticed by Greaves' 21-year-old sister Lisa and 3-year-old daughter, Avery, who were in at the house at the time. Unwilling to leave any witnesses, Eichinger went to the bathroom and stabbed Lisa to death before catching up to Avery in the hallway and killing her. He then started walking back to his car, where a neighbor of Greaves' observed him with bloodied clothes and a rag tied around his hand. The Greaves' father discovered the victims' bodies when he returned home from work.[5]\nAs the killings heavily resembled Still's murder years prior, authorities looked into whether the four victims had any connections. After learning that Still and Greaves had been mutual friends with each other and with Eichinger, Detective Richard Nilsen was dispatched to interrogate him at his workplace in Somers Point.[7] Initially, Eichinger denied responsibility, claiming that the scratches on his arm were the result of a dog bite and a cut sustained while he was taking out the trash and that he had been at a boardwalk in Ocean City when the killings took place.[1] However, when he noticed that Nilsen was carrying a gun on him, Eichinger decided to confess to the four killings, bizarrely stating that he followed company policy to \"never resist a man with a gun.\"[7]\nNot long after, Eichinger waived his right to an extradition hearing and was extradited to Pennsylvania, where he was charged with four counts of capital murder.[4] He confessed to the four murders before the judge, arguing that he should be given a life sentence in light of mitigating evidence presented by his lawyers: these included claims that he suffered from schizoid personality disorder and that he was under extreme emotional duress when he committed the crimes, relating to the recent death of his father from Alzheimer's disease.[8] These claims were contested by the prosecutors, who pointed that the defendant had no prior history of mental illness, had planned his crimes in advance and the murders of Lisa and Avery were done to get rid of witnesses.[6]\nIn the end,  Eichinger was found guilty on all counts and was given three death sentences for the murders of the Greaves family; he was given a life term for Still's murder. At the sentencing phase, the victims' family members exclaimed that they hoped they would live long enough to see Eichinger executed for the murders.[9] Since his incarceration, he has attempted to appeal his sentence on multiple occasions. Still, each time, his appeals have been denied. In 2008, Eichinger's death warrant was signed by Governor Ed Rendell, but the sentence is yet to be carried out.[10]\nA notice of execution was signed on January 9, 2023, by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections Acting Secretary George Little. The notice sets March 7, 2023, as Eichinger's execution date.[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Franciscan University murders is an American criminal case involving the kidnapping of two young men from Steubenville, Ohio, and their murder in Washington County, Pennsylvania, on May 31, 1999.\nThe perpetrators were found guilty on several counts after a 2000 trial, but their murder convictions were overturned in 2004 in an  Ohio Supreme Court decision requiring the defendants to be tried once in each state for the crimes committed in each state. In response to the decision, \"Brian and Aaron's Law\" passed into Ohio state law in April 2005, which permits authorities to prosecute suspects in murder cases that begin in that state but have related activities in another state.[4]\nAaron Land, 20, Brian Muha, age 18, and Andrew Doran were students at Franciscan University living in a street-level apartment in Steubenville, Ohio.  On May 30, 1999, Muha parked his mother's Chevrolet Blazer outside their apartment.\nNathan \"Boo\" Herring and Terrell Yarbrough, both 18, were residents of the Steubenville area. Herring later stated that he had consumed beer, cocaine, marijuana, and prescription drugs before the crimes committed on May 31, 1999.[3]\nDuring the early morning hours of May 31, 1999, Land and Doran were asleep in their bedrooms, and Muha was asleep on the living room couch. At approximately 5:00\u00a0a.m. on May 31, 1999, Yarbrough and Herring broke into the apartment and woke up Land and Muha by repeatedly hitting them with a pistol.  Yarbrough and Herring then demanded the keys to the Blazer, and Muha gave them the keys. Doran was awakened by the noise of \"a loud series of crashes,\" and crawled out a window and re-entered the house by a side door and called to Aaron and Brian. There was no response. Doran then saw a black male with a white handkerchief over his mouth and a hood pulled over his head.  The man saw Doran; however he ran and managed to escape to a nearby residence and called the police.[5]\nYarbrough and Herring forced Land and Muha out of the house and into the back seat of the Blazer and drove toward Pittsburgh. In Robinson Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania, Yarbrough and Herring stopped the Blazer alongside U.S. Route 22.  They forced the victims out of the car and into a forested area. Herring then separately shot both victims in the back of the head with a .44-caliber handgun, killing each of them instantly. Yarbrough and Herring then took Muha\u2019s ATM card, some cash, walked back to the Blazer, and drove to Pittsburgh.\nAfter unsuccessfully attempting to withdraw cash using Muha's ATM card in Pittsburgh, Yarbrough and Herring went to the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh to steal a second car. Barbara Vey became Yarbrough and Herring's next victim, as they attacked her in the stairwell of her apartment complex and demanded the keys to her car. Apparently Herring was going to shoot and kill Vey; however, Yarbrough intervened, sparing her life.[6] Vey gave her keys to the men and called the police after they left. Later that afternoon, Yarbrough drove the Blazer back to Steubenville, and Herring in Vey's stolen BMW. En route, Yarbrough ran out of gas and Herring did not stop to assist him. Brian Porter, a passing motorist, stopped and gave Yarbrough a ride to a nearby gas station.\nAfter returning to Steubenville, Yarbrough met with a friend, Brandon Young, and they drove around together in the Blazer. After Young inquired where the Blazer was from Yarbrough admitted to him that he had killed Muha and Land and stolen the car.[7] Police spotted the Blazer at around 6 o'clock that evening. Yarbrough and Young both abandoned the car, but Yarbrough was captured after a short chase. At 8 pm police recovered Vey's stolen BMW. On June 2, police apprehended Young, who had eluded capture earlier, and Yarbrough's accomplice Herring without incident.  Muha and Land's bodies were found after an extensive search on June 4, 1999.[8]\nProsecutors opted to hold one trial for each defendant in Ohio rather than trials in both states,[9] saying it would be more efficient and compassionate for the victims' families. Herring was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole in August 2000.[10] Yarbrough was convicted and sentenced to death in September 2000.[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "Henry Beam Piper (March 23, 1904 \u2013 c.\u2009 November 6, 1964) was an American science fiction writer. He wrote many short stories and several novels. He is best known for his extensive Terro-Human Future History series of stories and a shorter series of \"Paratime\" alternate history tales.\nHe wrote under the name H. Beam Piper. Another source gives his name as \"Horace Beam Piper\" and a different date of death.[1] His gravestone says \"Henry Beam Piper\". Piper himself may have been the source of part of the confusion; he told people the H stood for Horace, encouraging the assumption that he used the initial because he disliked his name. On a copy of Little Fuzzy given to Charles O. Piper, Beam's cousin and executor, he wrote \"To Charles from Henry.\"\nPiper was largely self-educated; he obtained his knowledge of science and history \"without subjecting myself to the ridiculous misery of four years in the uncomfortable confines of a raccoon coat.\" He went to work at age 18 as a laborer at the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona yards in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He also worked as a night watchman for the railroad.\nPiper published his first short story, \"Time and Time Again\", in 1947 in Astounding Science Fiction; it was adapted for the radio program Dimension X and first broadcast in 1951, and was re-produced for X Minus One in 1956. He was primarily a short story author until 1961, when he made a productive, if short-lived, foray into novels. He collected guns and wrote one mystery, Murder in the Gunroom.\nIn 1964, his career apparently on the skids, and prevented by reticence and his libertarian principles from asking anyone to assist him with his financial difficulties, Piper committed suicide.[2][3] The exact date of his death is unknown; the last entry in his diary was dated November 5 (\"Rain 0930\"), and according to his Pennsylvania death certificate his body was found on November 8. According to Jerry Pournelle's introduction to Little Fuzzy, Piper shut off all the utilities to his apartment, put painter's drop-cloths over the walls and floor, and took his own life with a handgun from his collection. In his suicide note, he gave an explanation that \"I don't like to leave messes when I go away, but if I could have cleaned up any of this mess, I wouldn't be going away. H. Beam Piper.\"[4]\nSome biographers attribute his act to financial problems, others to family problems; Pournelle wrote that Piper felt burdened by financial hardships in the wake of a divorce, and the mistaken perception that his career was foundering (his agent had died without notifying him of multiple sales). Editor George H. Scithers, who knew Piper socially, has stated that Piper wanted to spite the ex-wife he despised: by killing himself, Piper voided his life insurance policy, and prevented her from collecting.\nAn unpublished story, \"Only the Arquebus\", was missing after his suicide; it is probable that he destroyed it along with many of his personal papers.\nHis output was eventually purchased by Ace Science Fiction and reprinted in a set of paperbacks in the early 1980s. Many of these have since gone out of print, though his two best-known arcs were again reprinted by Ace in 1998 and 2001. Late in his career, Piper corresponded with Pournelle, who was the Ace editor who helped reprint some of his novels.\nMany of his earlier copyrights have been allowed to lapse, permitting Project Gutenberg to distribute his work online.\n",

One other student named Archie McCullough was wounded.[1]\nHistorian Richard Middleton described the massacre[2] as \"one of the most notorious incidents\" of Pontiac's War.[3]\nOn July 26, 1764, four Delaware (Lenape) Native Americans  entered a settlers' log schoolhouse in the Province of Pennsylvania in what is now Franklin County, near the present-day city of Greencastle. Inside were the schoolmaster, Enoch Brown, and a number of young students. Brown pleaded with the warriors to spare the children; nonetheless he was beaten with a club and scalped.[4] The warriors then clubbed and scalped the children. Brown and ten children were killed.[3][4] One scalped child, Archie McCullough, survived his wounds.[4] [3]\nA child survivor recounted \"Two old Indians and a young Indian rushed up to the door soon after the opening of the morning session. The master, surmising their objective, prayed them only to take his life and spare the children, but all were brutally knocked in the head with an Indian maul and scalped.\"[5]\nA day earlier, the warriors had encountered a pregnant woman, identified as Susan King Cunningham, on the road. She was beaten to death, scalped, and the baby was cut out of her body.[4] When the warriors returned to their village on the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country and showed the scalps, an elder Delaware chief rebuked them as cowards for attacking children.[4] John McCullough, a settler who had been held prisoner by the Delaware since 1756,[6] later described the return of the raiding party in his captivity narrative:\nI saw the Indians when they returned home with the scalps; some of the old Indians were very much displeased at them for killing so many children, especially Neep-paugh'-whese, or Night Walker, an old chief, or half king,\u2014he ascribed it to cowardice, which was the greatest affront he could offer them.[7]Incidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania General Assembly, with the approval of Governor John Penn, to reintroduce the scalp bounty system previously used during the French and Indian War.[4] Settlers could collect $134 for the scalp of an enemy American Indian male above the age of ten; the bounty for women was set at $50.[8]\nSettlers buried Enoch Brown and the schoolchildren in a common grave.[9] In 1843, the grave was excavated to confirm the location of the bodies.[10] In 1885, the area was named Enoch Brown Park and a memorial was erected over the gravesite.[11]\n",

The brutality of the crime, the fact that she was pregnant when she was killed and the length of time that she remained unidentified created national attention.[3] After isotope analysis was conducted in 2007, it was believed she had been an immigrant from a Central European country. In 2019, it was announced police were considering the possibility that this victim had been a runaway foster child who was last known to be in New York,[4] but investigators subsequently located the girl and confirmed that she was alive.[5]\nOn March 31, 2021, it was officially announced that the victim had been identified as 15-year-old Evelyn Colon of Jersey City, New Jersey.[6] In addition, the identity of her alleged killer, Luis Sierra, was made public after charges were filed.[7]\nWhen discovered, the victim, who was carrying a nine-month female fetus, had been sexually assaulted, strangled and shot in the neck by an unknown person.[8] Her body was then dismembered with a serrated blade.[9] The gunshot wound had occurred postmortem.[10] Her nose, breasts, and ears had been severed and have never been found.[11][12] The dismemberment was described to be unlike that of a surgeon, but not \"haphazard.\"[13]\nThe parts of her body and that of her unborn daughter had been placed into three suitcases; two were striped with red, blue, and white, and the other one was tan with a plaid design.[2][14] They were of vinyl material and were all of the same size.[15][16] It was evident that the suitcases had been spray-painted black at some point and that their handles had been severed.[14][17][18]\nTo dispose of the body, the suitcases had been thrown off a bridge over the Lehigh River in White Haven, Pennsylvania along Interstate 80.[19][20] It is believed that the suitcases had been thrown out of a vehicle traveling west.[21][22][23] The killer had most likely intended to have the suitcases land in the water below, to lessen the chance of their being found.[24] Two of the suitcases had landed in the woods, 20 feet from the river; the third, containing the head and fetus, was found on the river bank.[16][17]\nHaving fallen approximately 300 feet, two of the suitcases had opened and parts of the body had emerged. The head, fetus, and the two halves of the torso were exposed.[16][25][26][27]\nOther evidence included straw and packaging foam, as well as a bedspread that was waterlogged with fragments of a newspaper that had been used to wrap parts of the body. The newspaper was later determined to have been The New York Sunday from September 26, 1976, and was linked to the northern part of New Jersey.[2][11][18][28][29] The bedspread was reddish-orange in color with yellow and pink embroidered flowers, and was made of chenille fabric.[2][14][16]\nThe body was removed by authorities and transported in plastic bags to the nearby Gnadden Huetten Hospital for examination.[11][30]\n",

In February 2015, Governor Tom Wolf announced a formal moratorium on executions that is still in effect as of February 2021. However, capital crimes are still prosecuted and death warrants are still issued.\nPrior to 1913, hanging was the common method of execution.[1] In 1834, Pennsylvania became the first state in the union to eradicate public hangings. For the following decades, each county throughout the state was in charge of carrying out private hangings within their jails.[2] 1915 saw the first use of the electric chair, two years after it was approved by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1913. The delay was due to the time needed to finish the Western Penitentiary in Centre County, now the State Correctional Institution \u2013 Rockview. From 1915 to 1962, 350 people were executed by electric chair. Most of these defendants were men, but two of them were women.[2]\nA total of 1,043 people have been executed in Pennsylvania since 1693.[3] As of 2002 this was the 3rd highest of any other state or commonwealth in the Union, after New York (1,130) and Virginia (1,361).[4]\nSince 1978, there have been nearly 25,000 homicides throughout the state of Pennsylvania, where 408 of these homicides ended in defendants being put on death row which amounts to 1.6 death sentences for every 100 homicides.[5]\nThe former Governor of Pennsylvania, Robert Casey, signed a bill in 1990 that changed the method of execution from electrocution to lethal injection.[2]\nIn 2015, the state of Pennsylvania spent about $46 million annually on the death penalty to maintain the prisoners housed on death row, as well as carry out any executions. The average price to house and take care of a death row inmate per year was about $42,000.[6] With concerns over the cost of the death penalty growing, Governor Tom Wolf requested a cost-benefit analysis.\nIn February 2015, Governor Wolf announced a moratorium on executions that is still in effect as of January 2020.[7][8] However, capital crimes are still prosecuted and death warrants are still executed.[8][9] Wolf stated, \"In no way does this mean sympathy for those guilty on death row.\"[9] In justifying the moratorium, Wolf asserted as concerns that the system claims innocent lives, is not a deterrent to crime, is racially biased, costs a lot of money, and disregards mental illness in the US.[10]\nThe death penalty is only applied when a defendant is guilty of first-degree murder. A separate hearing must take place for this defendant to be put on death row. If one of the ten aggravating circumstances listed in Pennsylvania law and none of the eight mitigating factors are found to be involved in the case, the verdict is death for the defendant.[2]\n",

Haefner was never charged with her murder, and died in 2002.\nElizabeth Ruth \"Betsy\" Aardsma[5] was the second of four children.[6] She was born in Holland, Michigan, to Esther and Richard Aardsma, and raised in a middle-class, religious and conservative household on West 37th Street.[7] Aardsma's father was a sales tax auditor for the Michigan State Treasurer, while her mother was a housewife.[8]\nAs a child, Aardsma displayed a flair for art and poetry. By adolescence, she had developed somewhat liberal ideals and displayed a concern for the underprivileged. Aardsma attended Holland High School and performed well academically, graduating with honors in 1965.[2][n 1]\nShortly after graduating from high school, Aardsma enrolled in Hope College in the fall of 1965, with aspirations to become a physician.[9] Her roommate, Linda DenBesten, later recollected Aardsma as an intelligent and fascinating individual who exhibited feminist traits.[10]\nIn the fall of 1967, Aardsma enrolled at the University of Michigan, studying art and English and sharing an apartment with three other female students. By her senior year, she had begun dating a medical student named David Wright, who by all accounts was her first serious boyfriend.[n 2] She graduated from this institution with honors in the summer of 1969.[10]\nUpon graduation from the University of Michigan, Aardsma initially intended to join the Peace Corps and travel to Africa, although she opted to enroll at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) when she discovered that Wright, her boyfriend, intended to study there and that he could not guarantee he would remain loyal to her if she traveled abroad for any significant length of time.[12]\n",

The case led to a critical overview of Newfoundland's legal and child welfare systems as well as Canada's bail laws.\nA 2006 inquiry found serious shortcomings in how the province's social services system handled the case, suggesting that the judges, prosecutors, and child welfare agencies involved were more concerned with presuming Shirley's innocence than with protecting Zachary Turner. The inquiry concluded that Zachary's death had been preventable.[4] The case led to the passage of Bill C-464, or Zachary's Bill, strengthening the conditions for bail in Canadian courts in cases involving the well-being of children.\nThe deaths of Andrew Bagby and Zachary Turner became the basis for the 2008 documentary film Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father, directed by Kurt Kuenne.[5]\nShirley Jane Turner (28 January 1961 \u2013 18 August 2003) was a Canadian-American daughter of a U.S. serviceman and local woman from St. Anthony, Newfoundland. She was raised with three siblings in Wichita, Kansas, but moved to Newfoundland with her mother after her parents separated. Her parents later divorced.[2]:\u200a80\u200a In 1980, Turner enrolled at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's, seeking to embark on a medical career.[2]:\u200a84\u200a\nUpon becoming pregnant, Turner married a long-time boyfriend during Memorial University's 1981 winter recess. The child, a boy, was born on 9 July 1982. Turner's husband raised the child as a stay-at-home dad while Turner continued her studies. In 1983, Turner moved to Labrador City and worked as a science teacher. Two years later, she gave birth to a daughter.[2]:\u200a85\u200a During this period, she resumed a previous relationship with a fisherman from Corner Brook.[2]:\u200a86\u200a\nFollowing the end of her first marriage on 29 January 1988, Turner married her boyfriend from Corner Brook the following July.[2]:\u200a87\u200a Turner also had an abortion that July, but the father was not known.[6] Turner gave birth to her second daughter on 8 March 1990, one year before she and her second husband separated. Turner completed her undergraduate education while raising her children with help from her second husband.\nIn October 1993, a man boarding with Turner confided to his therapist that he had witnessed Turner physically and emotionally abusing two of her children. Newfoundland social service workers interviewed the children, who stated that their \"disciplinarian\" mother punished them with spankings and beatings by belt. Turner's second husband claimed that she only used the belt as a threat in his interview. The case was closed on 11 January 1994 without an interview with Turner. Three years later, Turner and her second husband divorced, and she was granted custody of their daughter. Within days of the ruling, however, Turner sent her daughter back to live with her father in Portland Creek while her other two children were sent to Parson's Pond to live with their paternal grandmother.\nSince 1982, Turner had taken out baby bonuses for her children from a scholarship fund with the expectation of sending them to university. However, in the summer of 2000, Turner confessed to a relative that she had spent the baby bonuses on her own living expenses as well as her doctoral education. Turner insisted that she would earn \"big money\" after completing her post-residency training and would repay the savings for her children's post-secondary education.\n",

The perpetrators included a girl he was dating and his best friend since childhood. Due to the manner in which Sweeney was murdered, the ages of the teens involved, and the seeming indifference of the perpetrators, the crime received national media coverage.[2]\nJason Sweeney left school and was working for his father, a contractor, on a building project in Philadelphia. He recently met a girl he liked, 15-year-old Justina Morley, with whom he had a date on the evening of Friday, May 30, 2003. Unbeknownst to Sweeney, Morley engaged in sexual relations with two other 16-year-olds, Nicholas Coia and Edward Batzig Jr.[3] Batzig was Sweeney's best friend since the fourth grade. Nicholas Coia and his 17-year-old brother, Domenic Coia, were also friends with Sweeney, but the brothers later ended the friendship.[4]\nWith the promise of sex, Morley lured Sweeney to \"The Trails,\" a wooded area of Fishtown near the Delaware River, where Batzig and the Coia brothers were lying in wait. Batzig took the first blow, striking Sweeney in the head four or five times.[5]  Batzig and the Coia brothers then pummeled Sweeney, primarily on his head and face, with a hatchet, a hammer and a rock until he was dead. Batzig later told a detective how he hit Sweeney with the hatchet face four or five times. Batzig said, \"Jason started begging for his life, but we just kept hitting him.\"[6] Batzig also said that Sweeney looked at him during the beating and said, \u201cPlease stop, I'm bleeding,\" after which Batzig hit Sweeney again with the axe.[citation needed] They finished by dropping a boulder on the right side of his head.[7] Sweeney's head was crushed and the only bone left undamaged was his left cheekbone.[8] He was identified by a cut on his hand that he sustained at his construction job.[citation needed]\nFollowing Sweeney's murder, the four assailants stole the $500 cash he earned from work.[7] Before leaving the crime scene, the Coias, Batzig and Morley shared a group hug and split the money, which they used to buy jewelry and illegal drugs\u2014heroin, marijuana, and Xanax\u2014and then \"partied beyond redemption,\" according to Domenic.[6][9]\nDomenic Coia confessed in a court hearing that they were all involved in the murder of Sweeney. The police said the murder was planned days before. Part of the preparation of the murder was listening to the Beatles song \"Helter Skelter\" over forty times, prompting later news coverage to draw a parallel to the Manson family murders.[2][6] Joshua Staab, 18, a friend of Domenic Coia, said that the group bragged about their plan to kill Sweeney by using Justina Morley as \"bait.\" Staab also said that Batzig knew that Sweeney would have his paycheck earnings on him on the day of the murder. The prosecutor asked Staab about the teens' demeanor after the killing. Staab said, \"They seemed pretty fine. In a way, happy.\"[6]\nAlthough all four teens involved in the murder were drug addicts, they were not high before they murdered Sweeney. In response to a detective's question about whether they were high during the killing, Domenic Coia answered, \"No, I was as sober as I am now. It is sick, isn't it?\"[6] A detective involved in the case and a forensic psychologist later opined that the killers' motivation went beyond robbery and stemmed from envy and resentment of Sweeney's relative success in life.[10]\nIn his memoir, Domenic Coia gave a different account of the murder. Domenic claimed he panicked when Batzig actually hit Sweeney and only participated when he feared him and his brother getting caught. He also denies stating he was sober during the attack and states he later prevented them from killing Justina Morley as they feared she would testify. He also denies involvement in any plans for the murder before the day it happened.\nJustina Morley claimed that she started smoking marijuana at the age of 10, and shortly thereafter started taking prescription pills and snorting cocaine. April Frederick, Morley's mother, said her daughter started cutting her wrists at the age of 10. Morley was hospitalized for threatening suicide and self-mutilation in 2002. She was once admitted to Friends Hospital for cutting her wrists, knees and thighs, taking pills and displaying a suicide poem, which she penned on her door. Morley told her mother that she would commit suicide if her mother did not take her out of the hospital; her mother then took her out against the hospital's advice. Morley was expelled from public school in the eighth grade, which she then repeated at the private Holy Name of Jesus Catholic school in Fishtown.\nA psychiatrist hired by the defense team, William Russell, said the reason Morley began sexual activity at an early age \"was an attempt at validation of self-worth\". Morley testified that she had sex with both Nicholas Coia and Batzig in exchange for heroin just a few days before they murdered Sweeney.\nMorley was released on Dec. 20, 2020.\n[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nKermit Barron Gosnell (born February 9, 1941) is an American former physician[2] and serial killer.  He provided abortions at his clinic in West Philadelphia.  Gosnell was convicted of the murders of three infants who were born alive after using drugs to induce birth, was convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of one woman during an abortion procedure, and was convicted of several other medically related crimes.[3][4][5][6][7]\nGosnell, based in the Mantua neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned and operated the Women's Medical Society Clinic, a non-compliant abortion clinic that was dubbed a \"house of horrors\" during the trial.[8] He was a prolific prescriber of OxyContin.[9] In 2011, Gosnell, his wife Pearl, and eight employees were charged with a total of 32 felonies and 227 misdemeanors in connection with deaths, illegal medical services, and regulatory violations. Pearl and the eight employees pleaded guilty to various charges in 2011 while Gosnell pleaded not guilty and sought a jury trial.[10]\nIn May 2013, Gosnell was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of three of the infants and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, an adult patient at the clinic following an abortion procedure. Gosnell was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour informed consent law. After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.[11][12] Gosnell was sentenced to an additional 30 years in prison for federal drug charges.[13]\nGosnell was born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the only child of a gas station operator and a government clerk[14] in an African-American family.[15] He was a student at the city's Central High School from which he graduated in 1959.[16][17] Gosnell initially attended the University of Pennsylvania,[18] then graduated from Dickinson College with a bachelor's degree.[19] He received his medical degree at the Thomas Jefferson University in 1966.[16]\nIt has been reported that Gosnell spent four decades practicing medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and a teen aid program.[16] He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua.[14][20] Gosnell told The Philadelphia Inquirer in October 1972: \"As a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them.\"[21]\nThat same year, Gosnell also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental \"Super Coil\" method invented by Harvey Karman. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. However, complications from the procedure were reported by nine of the women, with three of these reporting severe complications.[22][23]\nThe 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a \"respected man\" in his community, and a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce's \"Young Philadelphian of the Year\" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House.[21] By the late 1980s, however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien.[21]\nGosnell has been married three times. His third and current wife, Pearl, had worked at the Women's Medical Society as a full-time medical assistant from 1982 until their marriage in 1990.[1]  They have two children.[24] Gosnell has four other children from his two previous marriages.[24] In covering his background, media commentators drew attention to the \"incredibly diverse\" portrayals of Gosnell, touching on both his community works \u2013 the creation of the halfway house and teen aid program \u2013 contrasted with portrayals of his practice as an abortion mill in which viable fetuses and babies were routinely killed following illegal late-term procedures.[16]\n",

These demonstrations were intended to recruit high school students to join the organization at the Days of Rage and convince them to join the Weatherman.[1] The institution of school had been specifically identified in the initial Weatherman statement as an oppressor of the youth of America.[2] Weather members felt that the curriculum taught in United States schools promoted values such as sexism and competitive capitalism.[3]\nIn September 1969, a group of Weatherwomen, carrying the Vietcong flag, marched on South Hills High School in Pittsburgh. While the mostly white, working-class students were on lunch, the group arrived and distributed leaflets which advertised the Days of Rage. A small group led by Eleanor Raskin interrupted a history class and proceeded to tell the students that what they were being taught by their educational institution was false information. Raskin declared the school a prison and called for the students to join the cause and participate in demonstrations in Chicago in order to bring the war home. A handful of students followed the women as they marched out of the school. By this time the school invasion had attracted the attention of a group of local construction workers. Verbal taunting led to physical skirmishes as the police arrived.[4] Raskin and twenty-five others, including Cathy Wilkerson, were arrested.[5] Charges included rioting, inciting a riot, and disorderly conduct.[4] It was reported (and since disputed) that the women ran through the school topless.[2]\nMacomb Community College near Detroit was the site of another jailbreak led by a small group of Weatherwomen that included Diana Oughton.[5] Nine women took over a classroom of forty to fifty students in the middle of a sociology final, blocked the door and lectured the class on imperialism and racism. The teacher's attempt to leave and contact the police was halted by the Weatherwomen who had been trained in karate.[6] The \"Motor City Nine\" were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and assault and battery.[2]\nJailbreaks were only slightly effective for Weatherman recruitment and became more well known for the resulting arrests that occurred.[2] Members of Students for a Democratic Society that had marched and protested alongside Weather members before the two groups split wished to further distance themselves from Weathermen due to their increasingly violent and chaotic methods.[2]\n",

At Fitzsimmons' subsequent trial, in which he was represented by famous attorney F. Lee Bailey, he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he served until his death in 1999.[1]\nGeorge Kearon Joseph Fitzsimmons was born in 1937 in Buffalo, New York, the only child of William and Pearl Fitzsimmons (n\u00e9e Tate). Little is known about his childhood and upbringing, aside from dropping out of college during his teens. Shortly thereafter, Fitzsimmons joined the Army and was stationed in Korea, where he took a keen interest in learning and practicing karate.[1] However, at the same time, he developed an addiction to amphetamines, which led him to occasionally become violent, have mental breakdowns or suffer auditory hallucinations.[1]\nIn an attempt to improve his condition, Fitzsimmons' parents sent him to the Buffalo State Hospital, where he remained for an undetermined amount of time before being released. After his release, he worked for some time as a lifeguard at a local YMCA, but eventually quit and moved back in at his parents' apartment in Eggertsville, New York, where he became known by locals for his expertise in karate and his love for weightlifting.[2]\nOn January 12, 1969, Fitzsimmons got into an argument with his parents over attending church, causing him to fly into a rage and bludgeon both of them using a souvenir tomahawk and karate chops. He then stole one of his father's cars and fled to Attleboro, Massachusetts, where he stayed at a motel until his parents' bodies were discovered by concerned neighbors on January 21.[3] He then left the state, intending to travel either towards Chicago or Arizona, but first stopped in Altamont, Illinois, where he wrote a telegram to a bank in Buffalo, asking that money be transferred into his bank account.[4] As the employees had already been notified that a warrant was issued for his arrest, they notified the police, who subsequently apprehended Fitzsimmons.[4]\nAfter he was extradited back to New York, he was charged with two counts of murder, after presiding Justice Edward Robinson denied his attorneys' requests that the charges be reduced to manslaughter.[5][6] At his subsequent trial, however, he was ruled a paranoid schizophrenic by the judge and ordered to be interned at the Buffalo State Hospital, thus acquitting him of murder charges. This decision caused further controversy when it was announced that he could be legally eligible to inherit his parents' $123,000 estate, as he technically considered innocent under the law.[7]\nAfter spending less than three years in psychiatric care, a panel of doctors declared that Fitzsimmons \"no longer posed a danger to society\" due to his exemplary behavior, and released him. Shortly afterwards, he and his wife Beverly, whom he had met in the mental hospital, moved to a house in Coudersport, Pennsylvania.[1] Mere weeks later, Fitzsimmons beat up his wife so severely that she had to be hospitalized, but was only convicted of simple assault since she did not want to press charges against him.[1]\nAfter a failed attempt by his lawyer to persuade him to go back to the mental hospital, Fitzsimmons moved in with his aunt and uncle, Euphresia and DeAlton Nichols, both 80, in Roulette, Pennsylvania. With each passing day, his paranoid delusions grew worse and worse, with him eventually coming to the conclusion that his aunt and uncle were trying to poison him by lacing his food with arsenic.[1] Angered, he confronted them both and an argument ensued, causing Fitzsimmons to grab a hunting knife and stab DeAlton twice in the heart. He then turned towards Euphresia, whom he cornered in the kitchen and stabbed to death. He then got into their car and drove to a sandwich shop in Buffalo, where he called his lawyer and told him what had happened, saying that he wanted to go back to the Buffalo State Hospital.[8] He then sat on the curb and waited for police to take him in.[1]\nTwo days after his arrest, Fitzsimmons, who was held without bail, was officially charged with the Nicholses' murders by a grand jury.[9] Shortly after his arrest, his wife officially filed for divorce, in addition to a lawsuit for battery.[10] Using his inheritance money, Fitzsimmons hired famed lawyer F. Lee Bailey as his attorney, with one of his first actions being a request for a change of venue to a larger metropolitan area such as Erie or Pittsburgh.[11] This request was granted, and the trial location was moved to Greensburg.[12]\nAt the trial itself, psychiatrists were called on both the defense and prosecution's side to testify their findings. While it was supposed that Bailey's defense team would proceed with an insanity defense, this was temporarily hampered by Fitzsimmons himself, who claimed that he was not mentally ill and that at the time of the murders, he was supposedly out on a walk.[13] The latter claim was disputed by a tape-recorded interview with Buffalo police officers on the day of his arrest, in which he explicitly said that he had just killed his aunt and uncle.[13] The case also drew attention due to the actions of his attorney, who left mixed impressions on the jurors for a variety of reasons.[14]\n",

He is co-creator of the Marvel Comics muck-monster the Man-Thing and of DC Comics Old West vigilante El Diablo.\nMorrow was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana,[3] where he attended North Side High School.[4] He recalled in 1973 that, \"Comic art was certainly the first artform I remember being impressed with ... [T]hose gorgeous gory newsstand spreads ...\"[4] After serving as editor of his high-school yearbook, for which he did cartoons and illustration,[5] and working a number of odd jobs including \"soda jerk, street repairman, tie designer, exercise boy on the race track circuit, etc.,\" he enrolled in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago, Illinois, in late summer 1954, studying two nights a week for three months under Jerry Warshaw for \"the total of my entire formal art training.\"[4] His first formal commission \"was something like a bank ad or a tie design when I was still in my teens.\"[6] He joined the city's Feldkamp-Malloy art studio, later being fired. Feeling encouraged by a meeting with comic-strip artist Allen Saunders, Morrow submitted strip samples to various syndicates with no luck.[4]\nUndaunted, he moved to New York City in winter 1955 and by the following spring had met fellow young comics artists Al Williamson, Angelo Torres, and Wally Wood. He sold his first comic-book story, a romance tale, to Toby Press, which went out of business before it could be published. Morrow next did two stories for another company \u2014 a Western with original characters and an adaptation of pulp-fiction writer Robert E. Howard's \"The Tower of the Elephant\", but this company, too, went defunct. He then worked for Williamson and Wood[4] doing backgrounds and layouts, and through Williamson began contributing to Atlas Comics, the 1950s iteration of Marvel Comics,[7] drawing several supernatural-fantasy stories plus at least four Westerns and one war story  on titles cover-dated July 1956 to June 1957.[8]\nMorrow illustrated several stories for EC Comics in the 1950s, including horror, suspense and science fiction. He later did covers and stories for the company's New Trend comics and Picto-Fiction magazines.[8]\nIn late 1956, Morrow was drafted[7] into the U.S. Army.[9] Stationed at Incheon and Wolmido Island, South Korea, with Fox Company, he did \"illustrations and paintings for the officers' club, day rooms, insignias on helmets for their parades ... you know, anything and everything. That was my official duty.\"[7] After being discharged in 1958, \"My friend Angelo Torres took me around to a couple of his clients, one being 'Classics' [i.e., the Gilberton Company, publisher of the Classics Illustrated comic-book series of literary adaptations], and I was given a script. One thing led to another and I was soon working on a regular basis.[9]\nPrior to his Gilberton stint, Morrow contributed to one of the first black-and-white horror-comics magazines, the Joe Simon-edited Eerie Tales #1 (Nov. 1959) from Hastings Associates, penciling and inking two four-page stories by an unknown writer, \"The Stalker\" and \"Burn!\"[8]\nIn the early 1960s, Morrow anonymously[3] illustrated three literary adaptations for Classics Illustrated: The Octopus by Frank Norris (#159, Nov. 1960); Master of the World by Jules Verne (#163, July 1961); and The Queen's Necklace by Alexandre Dumas (#165, Jan. 1962),[10] which he said he penciled and inked at the rate of \"eight pages a day ... as fast as I've ever been able to go\" since \"I'd moved to California and needed those checks badly.\"[11] Morrow also supplied drawings for chapters in Classics Illustrated Special Issue #159A, Rockets, Jets and Missiles (Dec. 1960), and in 13 World Around Us issues ranging from Prehistoric Animals (Nov. 1959) to Famous Teens (May 1961).[12] One of those, #W28, Whaling (Dec. 1960), resulted in unexpected controversy when he accurately depicted African-American whalers:\n[T]he page rate [at Gilberton in general] wasn't much for the accuracy and authenticity they expected, but it was a challenge to 'do it right.' Roberta and Len Cole were demanding but genial editors. One job I do remember ... something about whaling, got me in dutch [i.e. trouble] with Roberta. My research indicated that many of the whalers were black \u2014 so that's what I drew. She had a fit and insisted they all be redrawn to 'avoid controversy.'[9]In the end, the problematic chapter, \"The Long Voyage\", retained what one comics historian called \"a respectable number of African-American whalemen.\"[9] Morrow, however, recalled, \"[T]hey had me make them all white. I had to change their features.\"[7]\n",

He was convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend, Holly Maddux. On September 9, 1977, Maddux disappeared following a trip to collect her belongings from the apartment she and Einhorn had shared in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Eighteen months later, police found her partially mummified body in a trunk in Einhorn's closet.[1]\nAfter his arrest, Einhorn fled the country and spent twenty-three years in Europe before being extradited to the United States. He took the stand in his own defense, claiming his ex-girlfriend had been killed by CIA agents who had framed him for the crime because he knew too much about the agency's paranormal military research. He was convicted and served a life sentence until his death in prison on April 3, 2020.[1][2]\nHis nickname, \"the Unicorn\", was derived from his surname; Einhorn means \"unicorn\" in German.\nIra Einhorn was born into a middle-class Jewish family.[1][3] As a student at the University of Pennsylvania (where he received his undergraduate degree in English in 1961 before returning to complete some graduate work in the discipline in 1963)[4][5] he became active in ecological groups and was part of the counterculture, anti-establishment, and anti-war movements of the 1960s and 1970s.[1] Einhorn was a speaker at the first Earth Day event in Philadelphia in 1970,[6] and later claimed to have been instrumental in creating and launching the event,[1] but event organizers refute his account.[7][8]\nEinhorn served as an instructor of English at Temple University during the 1964\u20131965 academic year, although his contract was not renewed after he conceded his \"contempt for the academic world\" and boasted of proffering \"straight answers about the delights and dangers\" of cannabis and LSD to students in an interview.[9] He also was a resident fellow at the Harvard Institute of Politics during the autumn 1978 semester.[5][10][11]\nEinhorn had a five-year relationship with Holly Maddux, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College who was originally from Tyler, Texas. In 1977, Maddux broke up with Einhorn and went to New York City, where she became involved with Saul Lapidus. On September 9, 1977, Maddux returned to the Philadelphia apartment she had previously shared with Einhorn to collect her belongings (which Einhorn had reportedly threatened to throw out into the street as trash) and was never seen again. Several weeks later, the Philadelphia police questioned Einhorn about her disappearance. He claimed that Maddux had gone out to the neighborhood co-op to buy some tofu and sprouts, and never returned.\nEinhorn's initial alibi came into question when his neighbors began complaining about a foul smell coming from his apartment, which in turn aroused the suspicion of authorities. Eighteen months later, on March 28, 1979, Maddux's decomposing corpse was found by police in a trunk stored in Einhorn's closet. After finding the body, a police officer reportedly said to Einhorn, \"It looks like we found Holly,\" to which he reportedly replied, \"You found what you found.\" Einhorn's lawyer, Arlen Specter, negotiated bail of $40,000; he was released from custody after posting a bond of $4,000, or 10% of the $40,000. This was paid by Barbara Bronfman (n\u00e9e Baerwald), a Montreal socialite who married into the wealthy Bronfman family and met Einhorn through a shared interest in the paranormal.[5] During Einhorn's flight he was again aided by Bronfman, who continued to support him financially until 1988, when she read Steven Levy's damning book on Einhorn, The Unicorn's Secret.[5][12]\nIn 1981, just days before his murder trial was to begin, Einhorn skipped bail and fled to Europe. He lived there for the next seventeen years and married a Swedish woman named Annika Flodin. In Pennsylvania, as Einhorn had already been arraigned, the state convicted him in absentia of Maddux's murder in 1996. Einhorn was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n",

At some point, the couple moved to Chicago. After the Great Fire, they moved to Philadelphia. A few years later, Brown was imprisoned in the Eastern State Penitentiary for highway robbery, and died serving his sentence.[4]\nSarah then had a child with a man named Thomas Storey, who kept an oyster saloon in the city, naming her Bertha. In March 1880, she married John Whiteling, bringing along her then 9-month-old daughter with them.[1] In 1886, the couple had their own child, which they named William C. Whiteling, nicknamed 'Willie'.[4]\nOn March 30, 1888, John died suddenly, with the attending physician Dr. G. W. Smith evaluating that the cause of death was inflammation of the bowels. His life had been insured in two companies: the John Hancock Financial and the Benevolent Order of Buffalos, each paying Sarah $145 and $85 respectively.[5] When questioned about his death, she claimed that he had committed suicide.[2]\nOn April 24, Bertha also died,[2] with her verdict being typhoid fever. She, too, had been insured by the John Hancock Financial for $122. And a month after, on May 26, Willie also died.[2] Since Dr. Smith abandoned the case, his colleague Dr. Dietrich determined the cause of death as congestion of the bowels. Like his sister and father, he too had been insured: for $30 at the John Hancock Financial, and for $17 at Prudential Financial.[5] Sarah refused when asked if the bodies could be examined by the coroner, claiming that when one of her previous children supposedly died in an almshouse, doctors had started the post mortem exam process and realised, much too late, that the child was still alive.[1]\nThe short intervals of the deaths proved suspicious to Coroner Ashbridge, and after an examination with the Health Office, he ordered that the case be investigated. With the assistance of Chief Det. Wood and Det. Gyer, the bodies were exhumed from Mechanics' Cemetery. Following an examination performed by Professor Leffman, large amounts of arsenic was discovered in the bodies. Sarah Jane Whiteling was arrested shortly after, and placed on suicide watch.[5] Spending most of her imprisonment in prayer, suffering from a nervous prostration for a physician to be called in, she confessed to murdering her two children using \"Rough on Rats\".[6]\nWhen questioned about her motives, Mrs. Whiteling claimed that she had murdered Bertha in order to prevent her from becoming a \"sinful and wicked girl\", as she had constantly misbehaved and stolen various items, such as pennies and pocketbooks, from her teacher and neighbors. As for Willie, he was apparently poisoned because he was \"in the way\".[2] When it came to John's death, Sarah vehemently denied poisoning him herself, and instead claimed that while she had bought the poison, he had taken it by his own volition because of the family's extreme poverty.[2] Apparently, she had planned to take her own life after the murders, but decided against it since the Bible states that those who take their own life cannot enter Heaven.[1][4]\nAt her trial, Whiteling's lawyer tried his best to convince the jury that his client was insane, and had to be sentenced to life imprisonment. After deliberating on the issue, they returned and pronounced her guilty of first degree murder and received a mandatory death sentence.[7][8][9] While the verdict didn't faze Sarah at all, it shocked the contemporary public in Philadelphia, especially the female population, who went so far as to sign a petition for commutation of her sentence.[10]\nDespite this, Gov. Beaver did not change her sentence. Whiteling was only prosecuted for her daughter's murder, as there was insufficient evidence for the other murders.[7][8][11] While imprisoned, Sarah was informed that she had been left a fortune from a deceased relative back in Iowa.[12]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Kelayres massacre was a shooting attack that took place the evening of November 5, 1934 in the coal-mining village of Kelayres, Pennsylvania.  An election-eve parade and rally by Democrats was fired on by multiple shooters as it passed the home of Joseph James Bruno, known as \"Big Joe\", the local Republican boss.  Three victims died almost immediately and two others died over the next two days.[1]\nThe attack received national news coverage, and accounts of it shared the front page with early election news in several major newspapers.[2][3][4]  The top newly elected Pennsylvania Democrats attended the funerals.[5][6] Six members of the Bruno family were eventually found guilty of multiple murder charges in four trials, with Bruno and his brother Phil receiving life sentences.\nBruno escaped from prison, leading to the then-largest manhunt in Pennsylvania history.  He was caught eight months later.\nAll of the Bruno family members were eventually paroled.  None ever admitted guilt, and no motive was ever formally established.\nKelayres is a small community of about five city blocks by ten.  Surrounded by coal mines, slag heaps, and a reservoir, there are only two streets that connect Kelayres to the neighboring towns of McAdoo and McAdoo Heights.\nJoseph James Bruno was the first child of James Biaggio and Marie Antonia (Abbato) Bruno. [7][Note 1]  James Biaggio Bruno first emigrated from Italy in 1877, and went back several times, in 1882 marrying Marie Antonia (Abbato). Marie and their son, Joseph, emigrated in 1886, on one of James' return voyages, well after James settled in Kelayres, making way for his young family. They were from a small village called Bucita, in Cosenza region of Calabria, Italy. [8]\nIn Kelayres, the elected school boards had the power to hire and fire schoolteachers, and related contract work was subject to cronyism.  A 1907 election which many locals considered questionable led to Bruno becoming school board director and a cousin Louis the school principal.  Brother Philip also became a tax collector.[9]\nFrom this point, Bruno's influence grew.  He would serve as justice of the peace, county detective, and an officer at the bank.  He ran a garage which maintained the local school buses.  He also ran slot machines and bootlegged coal.  In nearby Pottsville, he ran a brothel.  Critics claimed he abused his powers to enforce loyalty.[9]\nIn 1932, the old wooden schoolhouse burned down.  Bruno led the construction of a new building, the \"Bruno School\".  His brother Louis, the acknowledged brains of the family, was killed in an automobile accident, and Bruno's ways of dealing with opposition became cruder and more antagonizing.[10]\n",

He committed a series of rapes in Philadelphia between 1997 and 1999, where he was known as the \"Center City rapist\". He also committed rapes in Fort Collins, Colorado, in 2001, where he was arrested in 2002. He is serving a life sentence in the Sterling Correctional Facility in Sterling, Colorado.\nTroy was born to Earl and Michal Graves in Minnesota. He grew up in New York and Pennsylvania, living with his mother and older brother, Marc, following his parents' divorce in 1986. He dropped out of Bensalem High School in 1989 and worked various jobs in the Philadelphia area while living in the neighborhoods of West Philadelphia and Center City.[1]\nHis whereabouts were unknown throughout July\u2013October 1999, when he reported for basic training at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Following training, he was assigned to F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming in April 2000, as a maintenance worker on missile silos.\nIn March 2001, Graves was married in Larimer County, Colorado and the couple later settled into a home a few blocks west of the Colorado State University campus in Fort Collins.[2]\nOn April 23, 2002, Fort Collins police arrested Graves for a series of six rapes near Colorado State University. Graves' DNA matched that of the Center City rapist and that left at Schieber's murder scene, a link made in May 2001 that had led law enforcement in both states to work together to create a list of individuals who had connections in Fort Collins and Philadelphia. Fort Collins authorities also linked Graves to at least one of the Colorado crimes through fingerprint evidence.[4]\nGraves pleaded guilty to the Fort Collins assaults on May 17, 2002, and to the Philadelphia crimes on May 30, 2002, in order to prevent a possible death sentence in Philadelphia. He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole in both states, but will serve his time in Colorado because he pleaded guilty there first.[5][6]\nTelevision shows about the case include:\n",

        "paragraph": "\n\nA series of general strikes was coordinated on March 25, 2019 by Lyft and Uber drivers in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, California, United States led by rideshare advocate group Rideshare Drivers United.[1] The strikes aimed to protest low wages, long hours, working conditions, and lack of benefits. The event was planned following Lyft's initial public offering. A second strike took place on May 8, 2019 in anticipation of Uber's initial public offering.[2] The strike in response to Uber's IPO took place in 25 major cities across the United States, and were also joined by drivers in other locations worldwide where Uber operates.\nBoth Lyft and Uber are ridesharing companies. Drivers, serve as independent contractors to Uber and Lyft and provide rides to individuals, similar to taxicab companies. Users are able to request or drive for both companies by downloading a smartphone app. Drivers are required to undergo an initial background check and vehicle inspection to make sure they are properly licensed and have a vehicle that is adequate for the company's standards. Drivers then link to a banking account so that Uber and Lyft can pay drivers for their service. A certain proportion of the rider\u2019s fare goes to the company for administrative support while another goes to the driver for providing the trip.[citation needed]\nIn addition, both companies offer various transportation services beyond peer-to-peer ridesharing. Uber offers food delivery service via Uber Eats,[3] and in select cities, Lyft offers scooter sharing (similar to Lime and Bird).[4]\nBoth companies, while having multi-billion dollar investments have alleged to be perpetually losing money, with the goal of investors not to make money, but to capture the market share of transportation services, particularly as a replacement to personal automobile use and mass transportation use. The launch of Lyft's initial public offering (IPO) and drivers' pay cuts in Early 2019 led to the first strikes occurring in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco.[5]\nThe planned strikes came in response to Lyft's decision to go public as a for-profit corporation, while Uber followed suit later that year. The rationale is that most, if not all of Uber and Lyft's profits are income derived from drivers who work for low wages, no benefits, and who are misclassified workers, rather than earned by executives who manage infrastructure.[6]\nThe first major 24-hour strike was held simultaneously, in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco on March 25, 2019,[7] the day Lyft went public and following a pay-cut announcement from Uber.[8][9] This prompted both companies to announced financial allocations for driver bonuses,[10] which the California based Rideshare Drivers United union says is inadequate, and still only amounts to a pay of $8.55 per hour. As of mid 2019, all bonuses offered were removed from drivers pay incentives, including the drivers share of Ubers\u2019s \u201csurge\u201d, or Lyft\u2019s \u201cprime\u201d pricing for passengers during busy commute times. The companies still charge riders the higher fares, but have stopped sharing those profits with drivers. [11]\nAfter drivers\u2019 earlier strike against Lyft, a second 24 hour strike was planned on May 8, 2019.[2] This strike included not just California drivers, but drivers from 25 major cities across the US, and was also joined by several other international locations where Uber operates, inciting a highly publicized worldwide strike against Uber Technologies, Inc.[11] The May 8 date was chosen as it coincides with Uber's IPO, which was estimated to raise the company $9 billion.[12] In addition to Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, drivers went on strike in Chicago, Boston, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., and were also joined by drivers from several international locations where Uber operates.[13]\n",

It is believed to be the oldest cold case in Pennsylvania to be solved through this method. The murder's solving gained major media coverage, partially due to the fact that 20-year-old college student, Eric Schubert had a significant role in the identification of Forte.[1][2]\nOn the morning of March 18, 1964, 9-year-old Marise Ann Chiverella left home for school, carrying canned goods to give to her teacher, at St. Joseph's Parochial School in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. At some point while Chiverella was walking to school, she was kidnapped by James Paul Forte. Forte raped and then murdered Chiverella by strangulation.\nIn the afternoon of the same day, a man was giving his 16-year-old nephew driving lessons when they encountered what they initially thought was a \"large doll\" in a coal-mining pit, but soon realized it was Chiverella's body and called police.[3]\nDespite months of nonstop work, authorities were not able to retrieve any initial leads following the murder.\nDecades later, in 2018, the authorities teamed up with Parabon NanoLabs, a DNA technology and genetic genealogy company. The following year, the company shared the DNA profile with genealogical databases.[3]\nThe authorities began to work with genealogist and Elizabethtown College student, then 18-year-old Eric Schubert, in 2020. DNA from semen on Chiverella's clothing was uploaded to public genealogy databases, leading to a distant cousin of the perpetrator whom Schubert then identified. \nOn February 12, 2022, authorities announced that with assistance from Schubert's research and Parabon NanoLabs' initial work, the perpetrator had been identified as 22-year-old James Paul Forte. He lived six or seven blocks from Chiverella, but did not have any known relation to her or her family. An exhumation of Forte's body was approved once he was identified as the prime suspect of the murder.[4][5]\n",

Four students sustained life-threatening injuries, but all survived.[3]\nAt around 7:13\u00a0a.m., minutes before classes began, Hribal,[4] wearing black clothing,[5] began stabbing and slashing students in the school's first-floor science hallway.[6] After stabbing several people, Hribal pulled a fire alarm, attempting to bring more students out into the hallway, according to witness testimony and surveillance footage.[6]\nHribal, who witnesses said looked \"emotionless\" during the attack, wounded 20 students and a security guard before he was subdued by Sam King, the school's assistant principal, with the help of student Ian Griffith.[7] While he was being restrained by King, Hribal reportedly refused to drop the knives, saying, \"My work is not done. I have more people to kill.\"[1][8][9][10][11]\nA total of 22 people, including Hribal, were injured during the rampage.[3] Officials said Hribal did not appear to have targeted any specific person.[1]\nThe University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) treated twelve patients. UPMC officials stated that two boys were in critical condition, two boys were in serious condition, and a boy and two girls were in fair condition. One victim was placed on a ventilator after a knife pierced his liver, while another suffered an open wound to the face that required 11 sutures. The teenage victims ranged in age from 14 to 17.[12] Eight other patients were taken to Forbes Regional Hospital in nearby Monroeville.[13] Several of those victims suffered serious injuries, including \"deep wounds to the abdomen,\" according to hospital officials.[3][14][15] In addition to the stabbing victims, two other students suffered unrelated injuries while fleeing the school. Hribal was treated for injuries to his hand.[2][16][17] On May 18, 2014, Greg Keener, the last of the victims, was discharged from Forbes Regional Hospital.[18]\nFranklin Regional High School was closed for several days while workers from a restoration company cleaned up.[19][14][20] On April 14, classes resumed at the school.[21] On April 9, 2015, Murrysville marked the one-year anniversary of the stabbing rampage. Several local churches held worship services that night.[22]\nAlex Hribal (born October 1, 1997),[23] a sophomore who has been described as \"really shy,\"[1] was taken into custody after the stabbing as the suspected perpetrator.[15][24] He has also been described as \"quiet,\" \"smart\" and as having \"a good future ahead of him.\"[25] He alleged that he was depressed, had suicidal thoughts during the fifth grade, and that those emotions returned while he was attending Franklin Regional High School.[26] He was believed by police to have threatened at least two students by phone prior to the rampage, but neither student was one of the victims.[27] Officials have declared that Hribal was responsible for the stabbing, that he stabbed people in multiple classrooms, and that he used two \"straight knives\", measuring 8 to 10 inches (20.32 to 25.4\u00a0cm), to carry it out.[13][28] According to testimony, Hribal had begun planning the attack on September 22, 2013.[6]\nSeveral items belonging to Hribal were seized from his home, including a notebook with writing in it and a knife holder assumed to have held the two knives used in the attack. A cellphone was also seized from Hribal's school locker,[29] as was a note dated April 6, which read, \"I can't wait to see the priceless and helpless looks on the faces of the students of one of the 'best schools in Pennsylvania' realize their precious lives are going to be taken by the only one among them that isn't a plebian  [sic].\"[30]\n",

Pennypacker   Governor of Pennsylvania \n\nThe Coal strike of 1902 (also known as the anthracite coal strike)[1][2] was a strike by the  United Mine Workers of America in the anthracite coalfields of eastern Pennsylvania. Miners struck for higher wages, shorter workdays, and the recognition of their union. The strike threatened to shut down the winter fuel supply to major American cities. At that time, residences were typically heated with anthracite or \"hard\" coal, which produces higher heat value and less smoke than \"soft\" or bituminous coal.\nThe strike never resumed, as the miners received a 10 percent wage increase and reduced workdays from ten to nine hours; the owners got a higher price for coal and did not recognize the trade union as a bargaining agent. It was the first labor dispute in which the U.S. federal government and President Theodore Roosevelt intervened as a neutral arbitrator.[citation needed]\nThe United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) had won a sweeping victory in the 1897 strike by the soft-coal (bituminous coal) miners in the Midwest, winning significant wage increases. It grew from 10,000 to 115,000 members. A number of small strikes took place in the anthracite district from 1899 to 1901, by which the labor union gained experience and unionized more workers. The 1899 strike in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania, demonstrated that the unions could win a strike directed against a subsidiary of one of the large railroads.[3]\nIt hoped to make similar gains in 1900, but found the operators, who had established an oligopoly through concentration of ownership after drastic fluctuations in the market for anthracite, to be far more determined opponents than it had anticipated. The owners refused to meet or to arbitrate with the union; the union struck on September 17, 1900, with results that surprised even the union, as miners of all different nationalities and ethnicities walked out in support of the union.\nRepublican Party Senator Mark Hanna from Ohio, himself an owner of bituminous coal mines (not involved in the strike), sought to resolve the strike as it occurred less than two months before the presidential election. He worked through the National Civic Federation which brought labor and capital representatives together. Relying on J. P. Morgan to convey his message to the industry that a strike would hurt the reelection of Republican William McKinley, Hanna convinced the owners to concede a wage increase and grievance procedure to the strikers. The industry refused, on the other hand, to formally recognize the UMWA as the representative of the workers. The union declared victory and dropped its demand for union recognition.[4]\nThe issues that led to the strike of 1900 were just as pressing in 1902: the union wanted recognition and a degree of control over the industry. The industry, still smarting from its concessions in 1900, opposed any federal role. The 150,000 miners wanted their weekly pay envelope. Tens of millions of city dwellers needed coal to heat their homes.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Buckshot War was the outbreak of unrest in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania that transpired after the Pennsylvania gubernatorial and legislative elections in 1838 when both the Whig and Democratic parties claimed control over the Pennsylvania House of Representatives.\nAfter being elected governor of Pennsylvania in 1835,[1] Anti-Masonic and Whig candidate Joseph Ritner served a successful term. With the cooperation of his unofficial advisor Thaddeus Stevens and Secretary of Commonwealth Thomas H. Burrows, Ritner used Public Works as an instrument of political patronage, providing thousands of jobs.  Thus it came as a shock to Whigs and Anti-Masons that Ritner was defeated for re-election by the Democratic Party candidate David Rittenhouse Porter.[2]  The campaign was considered very bitter, with Porter winning by a slim majority of 5,496 in a total vote of 250,146.[3]  This election was significant in regards to financial patronage as, if the sitting governor and his party could gain control both houses of the legislature, they would have the ability to control all appointments at a state level. The Whigs and Anti-Masons set out to contest Porter's election; having already gained a majority in the Pennsylvania Senate, they only needed to secure a majority in the House of Representatives to further their aims.\nIn order to secure the majority in the House of Representatives, Burrows, who was also the Chairman of the Whig Committee, used claims made by Charles J. Ingersoll to maneuver a tactical plan. Ingersoll, a Democrat,  was defeated in Congress and blamed his defeat on Whig frauds in the Northern Liberties District (Now known simply as Northern Liberties) in Philadelphia. He was able to persuade the Board of Return judges to disregard all 5000 votes from that polling place.[4] The seven Whig judges on the Board, however, met separately and made certificates to their party candidates in Congress and in the state legislature.[5]  They recognized the four Whig candidates in the Northern Liberties District, which in turn would give the majority of the House of Representatives to the Whigs.[4]  This majority was crucial to the party. With it they would have control of both branches of the Legislature. This would allow them the ability to control all appointments if Porter's election was successfully contested. When the returns were received by Burrows, he immediately claimed them as the legal and official returns and sent them to the House of Representatives.\nThe House of Representatives met on the night of December 4, where the Clerk of the House, Francis R. Shunk began with the usual roll call. However, after the names of the members from Philadelphia were read, Charles Pray, a claimed member from Philadelphia, said that the four members from the Northern Liberties District were not legally elected.[6] He later produced his own set of election returns, which had been legally certified. The Whigs demanded that the names of the four Philadelphia members be given their seats. On the other side, the Democrats claimed that Burrows had prepared legal returns that benefited only his party. In response to the two sets of returns being produced, Thaddeus Stevens, the leader of the Whig and Anti-Masonic party in Legislature, made a motion that the House proceed to elect a speaker.[7]  Amidst the confusion the two bodies elected a speaker,  with the Democrats electing William Hopkins on a roll call and the party behind Stevens electing Thomas S.S Cunningham by a viva voce vote.[8]  After both parties adjourned until the next day, Stevens's party went to the Senate, with a Whig majority.\nWhile at the Senate, the atmosphere became that of negativity towards Stevens and his party. While organizing the chamber, a contested seat caught the attention of the large crowd surrounding the ground. Charles Brown, a Democrat, contested the seat of James Hanna, a Whig, on the account of gross fraud.[7]  However, the speaker of the House Charles B. Penrose admitted Hanna to his seat, which subsequently outraged Democrats in the crowd for not recognizing or legitimatizing Brown's allegation. It was claimed that the crowd could be heard shouting, \"Kill Burrows!\", \"Kill Stevens!\", \"Kill Penrose!\"[9]  After much aggravation, the crowd broke through the bar of the Senate and headed towards the three Whigs. It was at this time that they had already escaped through the back window of the Senate, in fear of their safety.[10]  It is believed that the riot was led by the infamous \"Balty\" Sowers, a gang member from Philadelphia.[7]  Democrats denied any involvement with Sowers, however, a variety of sources state that his mission was to assassinate Stevens, Burrows and Penrose- all avid Whig enthusiasts.[9] Hence, suspicions arose around whether Democrats in Pennsylvania were trying to sabotage their opponents.\nAfter the commotion in the Senate Chamber, both parties still had no quorum, and remained at odds. The party under Stevens was forced to stay at Wilson's Hotel for their meetings, and out of fear continued aggravation, Governor Ritner demanded militia be brought in to the Capitol. In the fourth article of the United States Constitution, it declares that every state in the Union will be provided aid against domestic violence.[11]  Thus, Ritner looked at a federal level for assistance. He asked federal troop leader Captain Sumner to bring his troops to Harrisburg, however, the Captain refused on the grounds that the commotion was strictly a result of the political issues belonging to the state.[9]  When Ritner tried again to insist for help, this time from President Martin Van Buren himself, he was once again refused, with the president stating that interfering was beyond the federal government's legal duties and would be considered improper as it would be favouring one political party over the other.[9]  In addition, the riots had not resulted in any sort of physical violence and consequently did not appear to be a threat to the welfare of Pennsylvania's citizens. Just as in the Dorr Rebellion, when President John Tyler refused to send troops  to Rhode Island after the insurrection led by Thomas Wilson Dorr,[12] the federal government refused to intervene in the Buckshot War because the domestic violence did not seem to be of a great enough threat, and therefore should be dealt with by the state itself. Thus, the Buckshot War was not just a political issue within its boundaries, but it also addressed the role that the federal government played in less-threatening state political issues, which was very minimal.\nAfter being denied federal troops, Ritner then ordered the state militia under the command of General Robert Patterson to control any violent mobs. Without being supplied any proper ammunition from federal sources, Ritner ordered that the state troops be given thirteen rounds of buckshot cartridges,[13]  giving the incident its name. His plan was disrupted, however, when a group of citizens under the command of General Diller, member of the Committee of Safety, took control of the militia's arsenal and began using it against the Governor and his supporters.[7]  It was at this time that support for Ritner and Stevens had declined. The proprietor of Wilson's hotel closed his door to Cunningham's party, with three of the party's members- Chester Butler, John Montelius and John Sturdevant, leaving later that week to go to Hopkins's party.[7]  As a result of this switch, the Hopkins party now had a quorum, and slowly the latter party declined, with only the four members from Philadelphia and Thaddeus Stevens claiming its legality.[14] On December 25, 1838, the Senate recognized that the Hopkins party was the legal body of the House of Representatives, subsequently ending the Buckshot War.[15]\nThe Buckshot War increased Democratic support in Pennsylvania, which is reflected in the Pennsylvania gubernatorial election of 1841. During this election, Porter was re-elected over the Whig candidate, John Banks.  The election demonstrates the sentiments that the state citizens felt over the controversial events in December 1838.[16]  In Burrow's plan to use a second set of returns made by Whig judges and Ritner's call for state militia to protect his party, both men did what they could to protect the interests of their own party, rather than thinking about the state citizens as a whole.[citation needed] As a result of their un-democratic ideals, the gubernatorial election reflects how citizens decided to turn their support to the opposing party.[citation needed]\nAdams, James Truslow.

        "paragraph": "\nOn October 26, 2020, Walter Wallace Jr., a 27-year-old African-American man, was shot by Philadelphia police officers Sean Matarazzo and Thomas Munz in Cobbs Creek, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The two officers arrived in the area to respond to a domestic dispute. When they arrived, Wallace walked out of his house carrying a knife. The two officers backed away while telling him to drop the knife shortly before they each fired several rounds at Wallace, hitting him in the shoulder and chest. He later died from his wounds in the hospital. Wallace's family stated that Wallace was having a mental health crisis.\nWallace's killing gained attention after a cellphone video of the incident was posted to social media platforms, where it went viral. Protests against the killing occurred throughout Philadelphia in late October. Peaceful protests took place, as well as several protests which escalated into violence and looting, leading to arrests, injuries to police and protesters, deployment of the Pennsylvania National Guard, and a citywide curfew.\nOn October 26, 2020, police attended three separate times to Wallace's parents' house on the 6100 block of Locust Street in the predominantly black neighborhood of Cobbs Creek, Philadelphia.[11][12] Around 3:45\u00a0p.m., during their third arrival, Officers Sean Matarazzo and Thomas Munz came in response to reports of a person screaming and a man assaulting an elderly female. Several 9-1-1 calls were made by Wallace's sister, brother, and neighbor, telling dispatchers that Wallace was assaulting his parents.[13] Wallace's sister asked for a medic on the scene as her mother's blood pressure was rising and her father was feeling faint, also informing the dispatcher that Wallace was on probation and had a criminal record.[14] Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said the police dispatch prior to the shooting said, \"Tell the officers to use caution in responding to this, it\u2019s an ongoing domestic issue going on up there.\"  It is unknown if the officers were familiar with Wallace prior to their arrival.[1]\nAt 3:48\u00a0p.m., the responding officers arrived at the house, standing about 15 feet away from the front. An unknown person from inside the house said, \"Put the knife down,\" three times. Wallace then walked out of his house and onto his porch carrying a knife in his right hand.[15] Both officers drew their guns and yelled for Wallace to \"put the knife down\" around 11 times. Wallace walked down his front steps and towards the officers. He then turned away from the officers and walked towards the other end of the street. His mother followed him into the street and attempted to grab him before he brushed her aside as officers asked her to move away from Wallace.[14] An unknown woman yelled to the officers that Wallace was \"mental\" multiple times.[16] Wallace then walked back into the street while Matarazzo and Munz continued to aim their guns at him, repeating for him to \"put the knife down\".[1]\nWallace's mother told the officers not to shoot him moments before shots were fired.[17] An unknown man said \"Get him,\" and \"Shoot him,\" before each officer fired about seven times, with an unknown number of shots hitting Wallace.[16][18] Wallace's mother ran to him as he was dying, and yelled at officers, \"You killed my son!\"[14][16] The shots hit Wallace in the shoulder and chest.[19][20][21] One of the officers placed Wallace in a police vehicle and drove him to the hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly after arriving.[22]\nThe officers involved in the shooting were moved to desk duty pending an investigation.[23]\nThe attorney for the Wallace family, Shaka Johnson, said the family had called for an ambulance to get Wallace help with a mental health crisis, not for police intervention, and that Wallace was suffering from bipolar disorder.[4] Wallace's parents said officers knew their son was in a mental health crisis because they had been to the family's house three times on October 26.[24]  The family does not want murder charges filed against the officers, and intend to file a wrongful death lawsuit.[25] They also called for the police department's responses to mental health crises to change.[9]\nOn November 4, the officers involved in the shooting were identified.[26] Investigations into the shooting by the PPD's Officer-Involved Shooting Investigation Unit and the Special Investigations Unit of the District Attorney's office are ongoing.[14]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Coatesville, Pennsylvania arsons refer to a spree of deliberately set fires in 2008 and 2009 in the area of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, a small Philadelphia suburb. There were 26 fires set in Coatesville in the year 2008 and, since January 1, 2009, there have been 18 reported cases of arson in the city and five more in the surrounding area.[1] The fires have caused more than $3 million in damage, left scores of people homeless and resulted in the death of one 83-year-old woman. As of March 2009, six people have been arrested in connection with some of the fires.\nAs of February\u00a02009[update], there were 18 fires set in Coatesville, Pennsylvania and five in nearby surrounding areas since January 1, 2009. The city originally reported 15 cases of arson in 2008, but upon further investigation due to media requests for more information, the number of reported 2008 arsons was increased to 26.[1] Coatesville, which is less than two square miles in size, receives about one or two arsons in a normal year.[2] The fires have caused more than $3 million in damage so far.[3]\n\"These offenses are probably the most serious crime spree that has occurred during the 30 years I've been with the district attorney's office.\"\nJoseph Carroll, Chester County District Attorney[4]\nBy February, one death had been reported as a result of the arsons. Irene Kempest, an 83-year-old widow and Nazi war camp survivor,[5][6] was killed due to smoke inhalation when her Strode Avenue home in Coatesville was set ablaze on December 7, 2008 at about 12:20\u00a0a.m. Emergency responders searching the building found Kempest was unconscious upstairs and removed her from the house, but she died in an area hospital the next day. The fire was one of four set between December 6 and December 9 alone.[5] George Donkewicz, 22, was arrested for setting the fire that killed Kempest and an additional fire from December 9. Donkewicz, who has been charged with murder and other charges, is one of three people to have been arrested so far in connection with the Coatesville arsons.[7] (See Arrests section below.)\nThe largest reported fire by early 2009 occurred January 24, 2009, when nearly an entire block of row houses on Fleetwood Street in Coatesville were burned down. The four-alarm fire was the fourteenth reported Coatesville area arson reported in 2009.[8] Authorities said it was set in the back of one of the houses during the night and quickly spread to adjacent homes, destroying 15 houses in total and causing between $1.2 million[9] and $2 million[2] in damages. Fourteen families, constituting 32 adults and 18 children, were displaced by the fire,[10] which took 150 firefighters three hours to bring under control. One firefighter broke his ankle while battling the flames.[11] Among the homes destroyed was one belonging to Robin Scott, a Coatesville city councilwoman, who escaped unharmed along with her family.[9]\nOn February 8, 2009 a fire was set in a mobile home in East Fallowfield Township, south of Coatesville. Authorities said the fire was deliberately set and shared \"common traits\" with the other Coatesville arsons. The mobile home was completely destroyed, but a married couple living there escaped unharmed.[3][12]\nOn February 22, seven school buses were set on fire at the North Brandywine Middle School, north of Coatesville.[13]\nAs of March\u00a02009[update], six people have been arrested in connection with some of the arsons. Chester County District Attorney Joseph Carroll has said that arsonists arrested in connection with the Coatesville fires could face more than a life sentence, since the maximum penalty for a single arson conviction is 20 years; Carroll said, \"I think life in prison is an appropriate punishment, given the extent of the property damage and terror to an entire city.\"[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Kelayres massacre was a shooting attack that took place the evening of November 5, 1934 in the coal-mining village of Kelayres, Pennsylvania.  An election-eve parade and rally by Democrats was fired on by multiple shooters as it passed the home of Joseph James Bruno, known as \"Big Joe\", the local Republican boss.  Three victims died almost immediately and two others died over the next two days.[1]\nThe attack received national news coverage, and accounts of it shared the front page with early election news in several major newspapers.[2][3][4]  The top newly elected Pennsylvania Democrats attended the funerals.[5][6] Six members of the Bruno family were eventually found guilty of multiple murder charges in four trials, with Bruno and his brother Phil receiving life sentences.\nBruno escaped from prison, leading to the then-largest manhunt in Pennsylvania history.  He was caught eight months later.\nAll of the Bruno family members were eventually paroled.  None ever admitted guilt, and no motive was ever formally established.\nKelayres is a small community of about five city blocks by ten.  Surrounded by coal mines, slag heaps, and a reservoir, there are only two streets that connect Kelayres to the neighboring towns of McAdoo and McAdoo Heights.\nJoseph James Bruno was the first child of James Biaggio and Marie Antonia (Abbato) Bruno. [7][Note 1]  James Biaggio Bruno first emigrated from Italy in 1877, and went back several times, in 1882 marrying Marie Antonia (Abbato). Marie and their son, Joseph, emigrated in 1886, on one of James' return voyages, well after James settled in Kelayres, making way for his young family. They were from a small village called Bucita, in Cosenza region of Calabria, Italy. [8]\nIn Kelayres, the elected school boards had the power to hire and fire schoolteachers, and related contract work was subject to cronyism.  A 1907 election which many locals considered questionable led to Bruno becoming school board director and a cousin Louis the school principal.  Brother Philip also became a tax collector.[9]\nFrom this point, Bruno's influence grew.  He would serve as justice of the peace, county detective, and an officer at the bank.  He ran a garage which maintained the local school buses.  He also ran slot machines and bootlegged coal.  In nearby Pottsville, he ran a brothel.  Critics claimed he abused his powers to enforce loyalty.[9]\nIn 1932, the old wooden schoolhouse burned down.  Bruno led the construction of a new building, the \"Bruno School\".  His brother Louis, the acknowledged brains of the family, was killed in an automobile accident, and Bruno's ways of dealing with opposition became cruder and more antagonizing.[10]\n",

He had been under investigation by then-United States District Attorney Richard Thornburgh for corruption.[2][3]\nBorn and raised in Pittsburgh, Duggan was the son of Blanche and Frank L. Duggan. His father was the president of Consolidated Ice Company and at one time was the president of the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce. He had two brothers, Frank Jr. and John.[1]\nHe was educated at the Shady Side Academy. After graduating from high school in 1944, he enlisted in the Air Force and spent the remainder of World War II in the aviation cadet training program. Following the war, he attended the University of Pennsylvania for an undergraduate degree and earned his law degree from the University of Pittsburgh.[1]\nHe married his longtime partner, socialite Cordelia Scaife May, an heiress to the Mellon fortune, on August 23, 1973 in Las Vegas.[1]\nDuggan was elected Allegheny County District Attorney in 1964, and re-elected in 1967 and 1971.[1] During Duggan's 10-year tenure as DA there were few prosecutions for gambling. Duggan's predecessor in the DA's office was Democrat Edward \"Easy Going Eddie\" Boyle. Unlike his predecessor, Duggan was born to an affluent family, with an estate in nearby Ligonier Township, Westmoreland County.[4]\nIn Duggan's third term as D.A., the Internal Revenue Service and Richard Thornburgh, then-United States Attorney for Western Pennsylvania (and later Governor of Pennsylvania and United States Attorney General), opened investigations into Duggan's sources of income and relations with criminal elements.[5]\nThornburgh obtained an indictment on March 5, 1974. That same day, Duggan was found shot to death on his family estate in Ligonier Township, victim of a shotgun blast. The body was found on the grounds of the estate; the shotgun was seven to ten feet from the body. Duggan, authorities said, apparently had been hunting before accidentally or purposefully turning the shotgun on himself. The Pittsburgh Press asked, \"Was the law closing in on Robert W. Duggan so inexorably that his only escape was suicide?\"\nUpon hearing the news of Duggan's death Thornburgh told a reporter, \"The terrible personal tragedy overshadows every aspect of this case. Anytime a guy perceives himself to be in a position that he thinks he has to take his own life, it's very sad. I've known tragedy in my own life. I know what it is.\"[4]\nDoubts emerged over whether Duggan had committed suicide given the distance of the shotgun from the corpse. \"You don't shoot yourself with a shotgun with your shoes on,\" one investigator told me, pointing out that the barrel was so long only a bare toe could have fired the trigger.[4]\n",

One of the Union Army's most respected senior commanders, he played a key role in committing the Army of the Potomac to the Battle of Gettysburg and was killed at the start of the battle.\nReynolds was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, one of nine surviving children of John Reynolds (1787\u20131853) and Lydia Moore Reynolds (1794\u20131843). Two of his brothers were James LeFevre Reynolds, Quartermaster General of Pennsylvania, and Rear Admiral Will Reynolds.[2] Prior to his military training, Reynolds studied in nearby Lititz, about 6 miles (9.7\u00a0km) from his home in Lancaster. Next he attended a school in Long Green, Maryland, and finally the Lancaster County Academy.[3]\nReynolds was nominated to the United States Military Academy in 1837 by Senator James Buchanan, a family friend, and graduated 26th of 50 cadets in the class of 1841. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery, assigned to Fort McHenry. From 1842 to 1845 he was assigned to St. Augustine, Florida, and Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, before joining Zachary Taylor's army at Corpus Christi, Texas, for the Mexican\u2013American War. He was awarded two brevet promotions in Mexico\u2014to captain for gallantry at Monterrey and to major for Buena Vista, where his section of guns prevented the Mexican cavalry from outflanking the American left.[4] During the war, he became friends with fellow officers Winfield Scott Hancock and Lewis A. Armistead.\nOn his return from Mexico, Reynolds was assigned to Fort Preble, Maine; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Fort Lafayette, New York. He was next sent west to Fort Orford, Oregon, in 1855, and participated in the Rogue River Wars of 1856 and the Utah War with the Mormons in 1857\u201358. He was the Commandant of Cadets at West Point from September 1860 to June 1861, while also serving as an instructor of artillery, cavalry, and infantry tactics. During his return from the West, Reynolds became engaged to Katherine May Hewitt. Since they were from different religious denominations\u2014Reynolds was a Protestant, Hewitt a Catholic\u2014the engagement was kept a secret and Hewitt's parents did not learn about it until after Reynolds' death.[5]\nSoon after the start of the Civil War, Reynolds was offered the position as aide-de-camp to Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott, but declined. He was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 14th U.S. Infantry, but before he could engage with that unit, he was promoted to brigadier general on August 20, 1861, and ordered to report to Washington, D.C. While in transit, his orders were changed to report to  Cape Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan intervened with the Secretary of War to get his orders changed once again, assigning him to the newly formed Army of the Potomac. His first assignment was with a board that examined the qualifications of volunteer officers, but he soon was given command of a brigade of Pennsylvania Reserves.[6]\nAs McClellan's army moved up the Virginia Peninsula in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, Reynolds occupied and became military governor of Fredericksburg, Virginia. His brigade was then ordered to join the V Corps at Mechanicsville, just before the start of the Seven Days Battles. The brigade was hit hard by the Confederate attack of June 26 at the Battle of Beaver Dam Creek, but their defensive line held and Reynolds later received a letter of commendation from his division commander, Brig. Gen. George A. McCall.[7]\nThe Confederate attack continued on June 27 and Reynolds, exhausted from the Battle of Gaines' Mill and two days without sleep, was captured in Boatswain's Swamp, Virginia. Thinking he was in a place of relative safety, he fell asleep and was not aware that his retreating troops left him behind. He was extremely embarrassed when brought before the Confederate general of the capturing troops; D.H. Hill was an Army friend and colleague from before the war. Hill allegedly told him, \"Reynolds, do not feel so bad about your capture, it is the fate of wars.\"[8] Reynolds was transported to Richmond and held at Libby Prison, but was quickly exchanged on August 15 (for Lloyd Tilghman).[9]\nUpon his return, Reynolds was given command of the Pennsylvania Reserves Division, whose commander, McCall, had been captured just two days after Reynolds. The V Corps joined the Army of Virginia, under Maj. Gen. John Pope, at Manassas. On the second day of the Second Battle of Bull Run, while most of the Union Army was retreating, Reynolds led his men in a last-ditch stand on Henry House Hill, site of the great Union debacle at First Bull Run the previous year. Waving the flag of the 2nd Reserves regiment, he yelled, \"Now boys, give them the steel, charge bayonets, double quick!\" His counterattack halted the Confederate advance long enough to give the Union Army time to retreat in a more orderly fashion, arguably the most important factor in preventing its complete destruction.[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "Troy LaFerrara was a Port Trevorton, Pennsylvania man murdered on November 11, 2013. Miranda Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in September 2014.[1] The murder is notable because of the unsubstantiated claim by one of the killers, Miranda Barbour, that she had murdered at least 22 other people, triggering worldwide news coverage of the case.[2]\nThe couple met Troy LaFerrara through an ad on Craigslist, where Miranda offered to have sex with him in exchange for payment.[3][4] Elytte has publicly denied that Miranda is a sex worker. He said that she met men that paid her for \"delightful conversation.\"[5] Miranda has stated that she agreed to meet LaFerrara for sex, charging $100.[6]\nOn November 11, 2013, Miranda allegedly met LaFerrara at the Susquehanna Valley Mall parking lot in Hummels Wharf, Pennsylvania. After settling on payment, Miranda and LaFerrara then drove six miles to Sunbury, a small city located about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia.[7] Elytte Barbour told police that he hid under a blanket in the back seat waiting.[8] After she allowed LaFerrara into her vehicle, Miranda signaled to Elytte, who jumped out and wrapped a cord around LaFerrara's neck as Miranda stabbed him 20 times in their Honda CR-V.[9] LaFerrara's body was discovered the next day, November 12, 2013, in a residential back yard in Sunbury.\nPolice said after Miranda and Elytte dumped LaFerrara's body, the couple then bought bleach wipes, towels, and cleaning liquid to remove the blood from inside the vehicle and then went to dinner. According to the arrest affidavit, Elytte said the couple killed LaFerrara because they just wanted to murder someone together.[10]\nAccording to police, the Barbours initially denied even knowing LaFerrara, but police traced the last call from LaFerrara's phone to Miranda's phone. As the investigation developed, the couple's stories allegedly changed from Miranda's story of self-defense to a mutual confession to premeditated murder.[11] The killing allegedly was a thrill killing, timed for three weeks after the couple's wedding, police have said.\nMiranda Barbour, 19, and Elytte Barbour, 22, pled not guilty to first-degree murder charges that carried a possible death penalty upon conviction. Both plead out to second-degree murder in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison.\nIn an interview with the Sunbury Daily Item, Miranda Barbour claimed she was molested by a relative at the age of four. Barbour's mother confirmed that Miranda's uncle was charged with sexual abuse of a minor and sentenced to 19 years in prison.[15] Barbour claimed that she joined a satanic cult at the age of 13 and soon after committed her first murder when the cult leader forced her to shoot a man indebted to their cult.[15] She claimed to be responsible for the deaths of \"at least 22 people\" between 2008 and 2013.[16][17]  This claim triggered worldwide media attention and led to investigations of the claim by the FBI and other police forces.[2]\nA Northumberland County District Attorney told The Daily Item that he was skeptical of Miranda's claims, saying \"We have been in contact with other law enforcement agencies where she has lived and haven't received any information verifying what she said.\"[18] The Alaska State Troopers released a statement saying they have no evidence Barbour committed any murders during her time in Alaska.[19]\nElytte Barbour graduated from Triton High School in 2010.[20]\nHe married Miranda (n\u00e9e Dean) on October 22, 2013 when they were residing in Dunn, North Carolina.[20][21]\n",

The cause of her death is not known, but it was considered to be suspicious by the authorities.[2][3][4] Her name is still not known, despite efforts to identify her.[5][6][7] She is the only unidentified decedent in the county.[1]\nThe badly decomposed remains were found by a stonemason alongside a river, near a highway in Perry County, Pennsylvania, near Watts Township.[1] The remains were mostly skeletonized and the estimated time of death was months before, perhaps as early as the Autumn of 1978.[4][7]\nThe decedent is believed to have been between 15 and 30 years old when she died, although she may have been as old as 38.[4]\nShe was white, had straight or possibly curly, shoulder-length blond or light brown hair.[6] She was between 5\u00a0feet 2\u00a0inches (1.57\u00a0m) and 5\u00a0feet 9\u00a0inches (1.75\u00a0m) tall. She weighed between 105 pounds (48\u00a0kg) and 125 pounds (57\u00a0kg).[3][7]\nShe had received dental care during her life, as a back tooth had been removed four or five years prior to her death. She also had teeth fillings. One tooth, which was a molar, had not yet erupted.[7] Her teeth showed no evidence of crowding. Despite that her teeth appeared to have had some dental work, it is not known if she had ever had braces.[2]\nPrior to her death, she had suffered a fractured rib, which had healed.[6] Just before her death, she may have returned to Pennsylvania after having spent several months in the southwestern United States.[8] Recent analysis of the decedent's bones indicated that she had spent a long time living in the Midwest or in Southern Canada, near the Great Lakes, when she was an adolescent.[6]\nPerry County Jane Doe wore several pieces of jewelry. She was wearing two sterling silver rings with turquoise stones, one of which also contained onyx pieces that are believed to have originated in the Southwest, possibly having been made by Navajo or Zuni Indians inhabiting that area.[9] She also had a chain bracelet on her right arm and a turquoise necklace and earrings.[2][6] The jewelry led authorities to believe the victim had ties to Arizona, New Mexico or a similar region.[1]\nShe wore a tan jacket, white boots with silver buckles, green and white socks, and blue slacks.[10] The slacks were described as having been made from knitted wool which contained strands of red thread.[2] She was wearing two tops, which consisted of a white shirt and a blue tank top.[2][4]\nThe victim had been buried shortly after her discovery, but was exhumed in 2008, following the reopening of her case.[1] Her DNA and dental records were recorded and are on file. Because of the condition of her remains, no fingerprints and no cause of death could be confirmed.[4] An initial examination of her teeth indicated that she had had three teeth extracted, but this was later disproved.[2][4][7] Despite the fact that these characteristics have been entered into national databases, there have been no matches with missing persons.[1]\nAbout sixty possible identities for her have been ruled out.[3] Her face was reconstructed twice by professionals. A sketch by Barbara Martin-Bailey was drawn in 2009, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created a three-dimensional rendering by digitally adding layers of muscles and skin to a CT scan of her skull, which was released in 2013. A revised image was later released in 2018.[6]\n",

His nickname \"The Ox\" came from his massive head and frame. Petto's nominal profession was that of a suit presser, but his real job was working for the Morello family. The Morello family was a Sicilian clan in Manhattan that became infamous for killing their rivals, stuffing them in barrels, and leaving them on street corners.\nOn April 15, 1903, after a violent fight with New York Police Department (NYPD) detectives, Petto was arrested for the murder of Benedetto Madonia, one of the Barrel Murders. The police found a pawn ticket belonging to Madonia in Petto's possession. Petto was arraigned and held at the New York City Central Jail, known as \"the Tombs\", pending an inquest. However, jail officials released Petto by mistake and he disappeared from New York. Petto eventually resurfaced in Pennsylvania, where he became involved in criminal activities with a Black Hand gang in the Scranton, Pennsylvania area. In August 1904, a witness implicated Petto in the kidnapping of Vito Laduca, a Morello gang member, but no charges were ever filed.\nOn the evening of October 21, 1905, Tommaso Petto, living under the alias \"Luciano Parrino,\" was on his way home from his butcher shop when he was shot to death in the village of Browntown, near the cities of Pittston and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The body was described as \"fairly riddled with bullets.\"[1] Within a day or so, police were able to determine that \"Parrino\" was none other than Tommaso Petto.[2] At the time, it was speculated that the murderer was Giuseppe de Primo, Madonia's brother-in-law. De Primo was a New York grocer who had helped the Morello gang distribute counterfeit currency. Serving a prison sentence when Madonia was murdered, De Primo was later released and allegedly tracked down Petto and killed him. However, no arrests were made and Petto's murderer was never found.\n",

Daugherty, who was mentally disabled, was tortured and murdered before being wrapped in Christmas decorations, put inside a garbage can, and dumped in the parking lot of Greensburg-Salem Middle School.\nAmber Meidinger met Melvin Knight at a homeless shelter in Washington in January 2010. They moved to several locations before settling in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where they met Jennifer Daugherty.[1] Knight met Ricky Smyrnes after meeting previously in jail.[2]\nMelvin L. Knight (born October 27, 1989)[3] was born to a drug-addicted father who was imprisoned during the early years of his life. He developed lifelong learning and social problems after he fell out of a moving vehicle and hit his head at age 5.[4]\nAngela Lynn Marinucci (born July 14, 1992),[3] according to testimony by her mother and half-sister, Marinucci suffered a head injury when she was hit by a truck in 2008, at the age of 15. The injury substantially altered her behavior and pushed her into a downward spiral that ended with Daugherty\u2019s death, according to the defense. Two mental experts testified that Marinucci as a child, suffered from depression and that she may have had drug and alcohol addictions as a teenager.[5]\nMeidinger told jurors, \"at some point, she [Daugherty] trusted me because she knew me from the West Place (a center for people with special needs).\" Meidinger testified she and her then-boyfriend and co-defendant Melvin Knight met Smyrnes on February 8, 2010, after she and Knight had been staying at a Greensburg-area hotel. Knight and Smyrnes knew each other after meeting in jail, and Meidinger was pregnant with Knight's child when all three met up. Smyrnes offered Meidinger and Knight to stay at his apartment at 428 N. Pennsylvania Avenue in Greensburg.[6]\nRicky Ven Edward Smyrnes (born March 6, 1986)[3] was born to a drug-addicted Philadelphia sex worker and a Pittsburgh gang member. He was moved into and out of foster homes as a child and was treated for mental health disorders as early as age 4. He suffered abuse and neglect until he was taken in by the Smyrnes family in North Huntingdon at age 10, according to testimony by forensic psychologist Alice Applegate.[7] His lawyer, Terri Fayes, told the jury that Smyrnes suffered sexual and physical abuse from his father and his uncle. She also explained how he had tried beer, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana by age 6, had been diagnosed with PTSD at age 8, and had undergone 103 therapy sessions by age 10. She added he was diagnosed as having as many as seven different personalities, and 15 total psychiatric issues. In 1997, he burglarized his neighbor's home and stole knives, guitars, coins, bullets, and cash. That same year, he sexually assaulted a woman in her basement.[8]\nAccording to a testimony by Meidinger, the group went through her purse and stole money, gift cards, and her cell phone. They poured liquids into her bag, hit her head with filled soda bottles, cut her hair, painted her face with nail polish, and dumped liquid and spices on her head. Meidinger said she and Angela Marinucci took turns violently hitting Daugherty with a metal towel rack and crutches. She also noted that Daugherty was stripped naked, gagged, and raped by Knight.[1] They also forced her to consume feces, urine, and detergent.[9][10] Meidinger also said Knight took Daugherty to the living room where Marinucci poured a bottle of water over Daugherty's head and Knight and Smyrnes dumped oatmeal and spices on her head. Daugherty said that her eyes were burning, and Smyrnes told her to take a shower because she smelled bad.[2]\nAccording to her relatives, Daugherty had the mental abilities of an adolescent, trusted everyone, and thought that the suspects were her \"friends.\"[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "The 1980 Pennsylvania Lottery scandal, colloquially known as the Triple Six Fix, was a successful plot to rig The Daily Number, a three-digit game of the Pennsylvania Lottery. All of the balls in the three machines, except those numbered 4 and 6, were weighted, meaning that the drawing was almost sure to be a combination of those digits. The scheme was successful in that 666 (one of the eight combinations of 4s and 6s that the \"fixers\" were hoping for) was drawn on April 24, 1980; however, the unusual betting patterns alerted authorities to the crime. The chief conspirators were sent to prison, and most of the fraudulently acquired winnings were never paid out.\nThe plan was masterminded by Nick Perry (1916\u20132003),[1] The Daily Number's announcer. Perry was born Nicholas Pericles Katsafanas in the Morningside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended Peabody High School and Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.  After serving in the U.S. Navy in World War II, Perry began a career as a radio broadcaster in Charleston, West Virginia, then entered television broadcasting on Pittsburgh's WDTV, the forerunner of KDKA-TV. Perry later moved over to rival WTAE-TV in 1958, as a staff announcer. Later, he became a news and weather reporter and was the host of local sports shows like Bowling for Dollars and Championship Bowling. In 1977, Perry became the host of the live nightly broadcast of the Pennsylvania Lottery, held in the studios of WTAE.\nPerry first discussed his idea with Jack and Peter Maragos, two of his partners in a vending machine business. Once committed to the plan, Perry approached local Pittsburgh lettering expert and WTAE art director Joseph Bock about creating weighted ping-pong balls that were replicas of the official balls used in the lottery machines. The No. 4 and No. 6 balls were chosen as the lucky lighter balls.\nPerry got access to the machines and ping-pong balls, which had been kept in a room at WTAE studios,[2] through Edward Plevel, a lottery official. The room was locked with two keys; Perry had one, and Plevel had the other.[2] Plevel left the machines and balls unguarded for several minutes on a few occasions. Perry also got WTAE stagehand Fred Luman to physically switch the original balls with the weighted ones twice: once before and once after the drawing. Bock then took the rigged balls back to his studio and burned them in a paint can a half-hour after the on-air drawing was done.\nPerry was the host of The Daily Number on April 24, 1980, when the drawing produced the number \"666\" for a then-record payout of $3.5 million ($11.5\u00a0million today) \u2014 including $1.18 million ($5.92\u00a0million today) that went to eight people in on the scam,[3] while six million Pennsylvanians watched that night never knowing that the fix was in.[2]\nLottery authorities and local bookmakers became suspicious when they noticed that a large number of tickets were purchased for the eight possible combinations, and a handful of players came forward to claim approximately $1.8 million ($5.92\u00a0million today) of the then-record $3.5 million payout ($11.5\u00a0million today).\nOn the date of the drawing, the Maragos brothers traveled around Pennsylvania buying large quantities of tickets containing the eight possible numbers.  The investigation was broken open when an anonymous tip led to a bar near Philadelphia where the brothers had bought a large number of lottery tickets.  An employee remembered the brothers coming into the bar with a platinum-blonde woman and laying down a large amount of cash to buy lottery tickets, all on the eight specific numbers.  The employee recalled that while he printed the tickets, one of the brothers made a pay phone call, spoke in a foreign language, and held up the phone so the listener could hear the lottery machine printing the tickets.[citation needed]\nInvestigators pulled the phone records and traced the call to the WTAE-TV announcer's booth in the studio where the drawing was done.  This strongly implicated Perry, and Maragos confirmed under questioning that the conversation had been with Perry (in Greek).[4]  Further investigation and questioning of the Maragos brothers eventually implicated the rest of the conspirators.  William Moran of Fairmont, West Virginia, organized the out-of-state buying of additional lottery tickets for a numbers-running scam.\nIt was later revealed that the Maragos brothers also placed bets on the eight numbers with local bookmakers who had illegal numbers games that used the lottery drawing as the winning result.  The brothers also told friends and family which numbers to play.  All of this may have contributed to the conspiracy's downfall, with the greater influx of slanted bets.[citation needed]\n",

Kreider was arrested a month later on June 16, 2007 and was charged with three counts of first degree murder. He pleaded guilty to all charges, and was subsequently convicted on all three counts and sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole. Kreider later became eligible for a re-sentencing hearing following the United States Supreme Court's 2012 decision in Miller v. Alabama, which held that mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional for juvenile offenders.\nOn 20 January 2017, Kreider died by suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell, before the resentencing hearing was scheduled.[1]\nAlec Devon Kreider was born on February 4, 1991, to Timothy Scot Kreider and Angela Parsons Kreider. Kreider lived with his mother and was a sophomore student at Manheim Township High School. He suffered from severe anger issues and tried to strangle his brother when he was younger.\nThomas Alan Haines (age 50), an industrial-supplies salesman who worked in Lancaster, Lisa Ann Haines (n\u00e9e Brown, age 47), a preschool teacher at Lancaster Brethren Preschool, their daughter Maggie (age 20), a student at Bucknell University, and their son Kevin (age 16), a high school sophomore, lived in Manheim Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Kevin Haines was also a sophomore student at Manheim Township High School, where he was classmates with Kreider in German class, and according to a fellow student the two were \"close buddies\". Alec attended the family's memorial service on May 19, 2007.[2]\nOn morning of May 12, 2007, Maggie Haines, who was awakened by a noise in the middle of the night and \"smelled blood\", ran from the home and across the street to a neighbor who called 911 for help.[3][4]\nAlec Kreider (then age 16) had entered the Haines' home without force, stabbing Thomas and Lisa  in their sleep, killing Thomas and severely wounding Lisa. Alec then went to Kevin's room and, after a struggle, stabbed him to death before returning to slit Lisa's throat, killing her, then escaping before the police could arrive. Communication between the Haines' neighbor, the call-taker at 911, and the dispatcher caused extreme unnecessary delay in police response to the \"unknown disturbance\". The official timeline notes that it took the first responding officer nearly twelve minutes to arrive from a distance of four miles in the middle of the night with no traffic barriers. Police say this delay had no bearing on the survival of the victims. The parents were found dead in their bedroom and Kevin was found at the opposite end of the upstairs hallway on the floor outside his bedroom. According to police reports, bloody shoe prints led away from Kevin's body and into the parents' bedroom, and from there to the common upstairs bathroom, where a shoe print was found on the linoleum in front of the sink. Police presume the murderer attempted to clean up at the sink as blood was also found there. Bloody shoe prints appeared on lower carpeted steps as the perpetrator exited the house. Blood transfer was also found on the rear sliding glass door. Maggie Haines was not killed because Alec did not know that she was home from college at the time of the murders.\nThe law enforcement investigation began around 2:40\u00a0a.m. on May 12, 2007. The victims were declared dead shortly after 5 a.m. by deputy county coroners, and autopsies were performed two days later. The day after the murders, bloodhounds tracked \"a strong scent of fear\" along a path that led down the hill to PA Route 501 and north to an ice cream/fast food restaurant, where the trail vanished. Police presumed the perpetrator had a vehicle waiting and used it to escape. Upon Kreider's arrest, all information associated with the bloodhounds was dismissed, as it did not match law enforcement's new theory. The police explanation was that \"the dogs made a mistake\".\nAfter a month of intense national and regional media coverage and speculation, including tracking by bloodhounds and an intensive search by Pennsylvania State Police cadets, Kreider was arrested on June 16, 2007. Kreider's father, Timothy Scot Kreider, informed authorities that his son had confessed to the killings two days earlier.[5] Kreider pled guilty to three counts of first degree murder and was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without parole on June 17, 2008. His age at the time of the crime prevented him from being sentenced to death due to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Roper v. Simmons (2005).[2] Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas Judge David Ashworth denied Kreider's post-sentence challenge to his consecutive sentences, and the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed Ashworth's denial. On December 8, 2009, Kreider filed a petition under Pennsylvania's Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act, which Judge Ashworth denied on June 15, 2010. An appeal to Pennsylvania Superior Court was later discontinued by Kreider.\n",

Seegrist killed three people and wounded seven others before being disarmed by a man who was shopping at the mall. The individuals killed included two men and a two-year-old boy.[1]\nSeegrist was 25 years old and had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia ten years earlier. Having been committed and discharged from mental care several times, her case stimulated discussion about the state's authority to commit at-risk people into mental care facilities versus individual rights.\nAt Sylvia Seegrist's trial, her mother Ruth testified that her daughter's paternal grandfather fondled and exposed himself in front of Sylvia when she was 8 years old, and that Ruth had not learned about the sexual abuse until Sylvia was 13. When the two discussed the abuse, Seegrist reportedly told her mother that she didn't know \"how intimate our relationship was.\"[2]\nSeegrist was first hospitalized at the age of sixteen, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was hospitalized a dozen times and, upon each discharge, psychiatrists diagnosed that she no longer posed a risk to herself or others.[3]\nWhen she was of age, Seegrist attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army. As she was being inducted, she faced harassment from other members of her platoon, who assumed she was a lesbian; they set her up on a prank date and made her the butt of many jokes thereafter.[4] Seegrist spent a good deal of time at the Springfield Mall, harassing customers and making statements about how \"good\" other spree killings were, such as the 1984 San Ysidro McDonald's massacre.[5] She was discharged from the Army after two months because of her unusual behavior, which included sitting fully dressed in green fatigues at the spa and sauna of her fitness club. An instructor at the fitness club said \"she hated everyone and would often talk about shooting and killing people\".[6]\nSeegrist's behavior was so disconcerting that clerks at a local K-Mart told her they had no rifles in stock when she tried to purchase one from them. She eventually purchased a Ruger 10/22 at another store.[6]\nOn the first of two trips to the Springfield Mall on the day of October 30, 1985, Seegrist shopped for Halloween items at a party store. She then worked out at a fitness club, before returning to the mall for the last time.\nSeegrist alighted from her vehicle, a Datsun B-210, retrieved the weapon she had purchased, and then fired at a man approximately 30 yards (27\u00a0m) from where she stood. The man was not hit and having seen the vehicle she arrived in, flattened one of the Datsun's tires to prevent an escape in that vehicle. Meanwhile, Seegrist had approached the nearest entrance and fired at, but missed, a woman who was using a nearby ATM. Before entering the mall, she shot and killed two-year-old Recife Cosmen who was with his parents waiting to eat at a local restaurant.\n",

Although both Rocco and Constantine were still alive by the arrival of the police, Constantine died in a hospital several hours later. \nFive Italians were arrested in connection to the riots, although the unidentified Irish rioters were never apprehended.\n\n",

        "paragraph": "Commonwealth v. Pullis, 3 Doc. Hist. 59 (1806) was a US labor law case, and the first reported case arising from a labor strike in the United States. It decided that striking workers were illegal conspirators.[1][2]\nIn 1794, Philadelphia shoemakers organized the \"Federal Society of Journeymen Cordwainers\" (the name came from the cordovan leather they worked with) in an effort to secure stable wages. Over the next decade, the union secured some wage increases. Through 1804, the Journeymen received moderate wage increases. In 1805, the union struck for higher wages. The strike collapsed after the union leaders were indicted for the crime of conspiracy.\nThe jury trial was in the Philadelphia Mayor\u2019s Court, which was not a court of record. The only report historians have today consists of shorthand notes by Thomas Lloyd, a young Jeffersonian printer who later published the proceedings.[2]\nEight leaders of the Federal Society of Journeymen Cordwainers were brought to trial and accused of conspiring to increase their pay rates after leading an unsuccessful strike for higher wages. The employers, not the government, paid the prosecution's expenses. The arguments in Pullis promoted the idea '\"that workers were transitory, irresponsible, and dangerous\", and were, thus, properly the subject of judicial control.[3]\nAfter a three-day trial, the jury found the defendants guilty of \"a combination to raise their wages\". The union of Philadelphia Journeymen Shoemakers was convicted of and bankrupted by charges of criminal conspiracy. The defendants were fined US$8 each (the cost of one week's wages) and made to pay the costs of the suit.[4]\nThe law established in this case, that labor unions are illegal conspiracies, would remain the law until Commonwealth v. Hunt, tried in Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.[5]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Scranton general strike was a widespread work stoppage in 1877 by workers in Scranton, Pennsylvania, which took place as part of the Great Railroad Strike, and was the last in a number of violent outbreaks across Pennsylvania.[1] The strike began on July 23 when railroad workers walked off the job in protest of recent wage cuts, and within three days it grew to include perhaps thousands of workers from a variety of industries.\nMany had returned to work when violence erupted on August 1 after a mob attacked the town's mayor, and then clashed with local militia, leaving four dead and many more wounded.[2] State and federal troops were called to the town, and imposed martial law. Minor acts of violence continued until the last of the strikers returned to work on October 17, having won no concessions. More than a score of those involved in the shooting were arrested for murder, and later tried and found not-guilty of the crime of manslaughter.  Two were tried and one convicted in libel suits related to published criticism of the militia. The militia would go on to be reformed into a battalion of the Pennsylvania National Guard.\nOpinions differ on the root causes of the strike and ensuing violence.\nThe Long Depression, sparked in the US by the Panic of 1873, had far reaching implications for US industry, shuttering more than a hundred railroads in the first year and cutting construction of new rail lines from 7,500 miles of track in 1872 to 1,600 miles in 1875.[3] Approximately 18,000 businesses failed between 1873, and in 1875, production in iron and steel alone dropped as much as 45%, and a million or more lost their jobs.[4][5] In 1876 alone, 76 railroad companies went bankrupt or entered receivership.[6]:\u200a31\u200a\nThe resulting public dissatisfaction erupted July 14, 1877 in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and spread to Maryland, New York, Illinois, Missouri and Pennsylvania.[7][8][9] Violence broke out in Pittsburgh, and between July 21 and 22, 40 were killed and more than a 1,000 rail cars and 100 engines were destroyed.[9][10] Another 16 were killed in an uprising in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, and strikers set fire to much of central Philadelphia in disturbances there.[11]\nIn 1874 mine owners reduced workers' wages by ten percent. Efforts to rouse a strike in response were fruitless.[12]:\u200a316\u200a The next two years saw the mines run on two-thirds time, and another wage reduction of fifteen percent was made in 1876. Again, efforts to organize a strike were ineffective.\nBy the summer of 1877 tensions were high as news spread of the violence in industrial centers across Pennsylvania and the nation. Making matters worse, the local mining companies had again reduced wages, and railroad and industry owners imposed similar cuts for rail and manufacturing workers.[13] As one observer stated \"the great trouble here in Scranton is our population, an excess of miners for the work to be done.\"[14]\nOn July 23, the workers of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in Scranton proposed that their wages be restored to that prior to the recently imposed 10% reduction. On July 24 at 12:00 P.M., 1,000 employees of the Lackawanna Iron and Coal Company, unaffiliated with the railroad, peacefully walked out due to their own wage reduction. The railroad workers struck at 6:00 P.M. that same day.[15]\n",

He, along with other passengers, formed the plan to retake the plane from the hijackers, and led the effort that resulted in the crash of the plane into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, thwarting the plan of the hijackers to crash the plane into a building in Washington, D.C., most likely either the U.S. Capitol Building or the White House.\nThomas Burnett was born on May 29, 1963, the son of Thomas Burnett Sr. and Beverly Burnett.[3] Burnett and his sisters[4] grew up in Bloomington, Minnesota. He attended Ridgeview Elementary School, then Olson Middle School.[4] At Thomas Jefferson Senior High School, where he wore jersey No. 11 and then No. 10, he led the Jaguars to the state finals as their starting quarterback in 1980. He graduated in 1981.[2][4]\nBurnett studied Economics at Saint John's University in Minnesota, where he was a quarterback on the football team. After two years, an injury shortened his football career and he transferred to the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota. He was named president of the Alpha Kappa Psi fraternity, then later graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Finance. He went on to earn a Master of Business Administration degree at Pepperdine University.[2][5]\nIn 1996, Burnett joined Thoratec Corporation, a medical devices company, as vice president of sales and marketing. In November 1999, he was promoted to senior vice president and chief operating officer.[6]\nIn 1985, Burnett became the biological father to a daughter who was given up for adoption. Her name is Mariah Mills Jacobsen.[7] In July 1989, Burnett met his future wife, Deena, in Atlanta, where she had just completed flight attendant training for Delta Air Lines.[8] They married in April 1992[5][9] and had three daughters, Halley Elizabeth, Anna Claire, and Madison Margaret,[10] and lived in San Ramon, California,[11] where Deena worked as a stay-at-home mother,[5] beginning when she first became pregnant in 1995.[9] Thomas Burnett had attended mass daily in the year prior to the September 11 attacks, attempting to address a sense of foreboding which he had expressed to his wife.[11] Burnett had busts of Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill in his office.[12]\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Burnett boarded United Airlines Flight 93, returning home to San Ramon, after a business trip.[13] Burnett sat next to passenger Mark Bingham. Burnett called his wife, Deena, after hijackers took control of the plane. He made several phone calls to her beginning at 09:30:32 from rows\u00a024 and 25, though he was assigned a seat in row\u00a0four.[14][15] Burnett explained that the plane had been hijacked by men claiming to have a bomb, and also said that a passenger had been stabbed with a knife and that he believed the bomb threat was a ruse to control the passengers.[15] During his second call to her, she told him about the attacks on the World Trade Center and he replied that the hijackers were \"talking about crashing this plane...Oh my God. It's a suicide mission.\"[16] He began pumping her for information about the attacks, interrupting her from time to time to tell the others nearby what she was saying. Then he hung up.[17] Upon learning of the situation, Deena, a former flight attendant, recalled her training and urged Burnett to sit quietly and not draw attention to himself. However, Burnett instead informed her that he and three other passengers, Mark Bingham, Todd Beamer and Jeremy Glick, were forming a plan to take the plane back from the hijackers, and leading other passengers in this effort.[5][6][18] He ended his last call by saying, \"Don't worry, we're going to do something.\"[17][19][11] Burnett and several other passengers stormed the cockpit, foiling the hijackers' plan to crash the plane into the White House or Capitol Building.[5][20] The cockpit voice recorder captured Burnett yelling, \"Roll it!\",[citation needed] possibly referring to using the food cart. Burnett also yelled \"We're going in!\".[21] To prevent the passengers from regaining control of the plane, the hijackers crashed it in a Pennsylvania field, killing all 44 people on board.[5][6]Burnett is buried at Fort Snelling National Cemetery in Minnesota. Funeral and burial services were held on May 24, 2002.[1]\nOn September 14, 2001, the Jefferson High School football team wore on their helmets the number 10, in honor of Burnett, who wore that number when he played at Jefferson High.[3]\nIn March 2002, Bradley Street, a small street in Pleasanton, California, that runs outside the headquarters of Thoratec Corp. where Burnett worked, was renamed Tom Burnett Lane.[6]\n",

It was the deadliest mass murder in Philadelphia history. Ten people were shot in a crack house in the 800 block of Lex Street in West Philadelphia. Seven of them died.[1]\nThe murders received substantial public attention, and four suspects, Jermel Lewis, Sacon Youk, Hezekiah Thomas and Quiante Perrin, were quickly charged. However, there was insufficient evidence for prosecution, and after 18 months in jail, charges were dropped. The men later sued for wrongful arrests, and eventually received a $1.9 million settlement from the city.[2] In 2002, four different men were charged in the case, brothers Dawud and Khalid Faruqi who denied being involved in the murder, and Shihean Black and Bruce Veney, who pleaded guilty.[3] All four were later[when?] convicted. The prosecution made a plea deal with the brothers: They were given life sentences rather than the death penalty. Black is serving multiple life terms, and Veney was sentenced to 15 to 30 years in exchange for testifying against the other three suspects, he drove the suspects to the scene but did not actually involve himself in the shooting.[4]\nOriginally, police had thought the shooting was due to a drug turf war, but in 2002 when the four guilty men were arrested it was revealed that the issue was over a car. Black told police that he had traded a Chevrolet Corsica along with $300, for Porter's (one of the victims) Dodge Intrepid.[4] Porter did not know how to use the Corsica's stick shift and blew out the clutch. After these issues Porter went to Dawud Faruqi who had traded a pistol for the Dodge Intrepid. Porter wanted his Dodge back, but refused to pay for the damaged clutch on the Corsica. Reportedly, Porter took his car back the next day with an extra set of keys. It was this bad car deal that led to the shooting on December 28.[5] Black told police that the night of the massacre was meant to gather or corral the victims, but when Dawud's mask fell off they began shooting to protect his identity.[citation needed] In the end, seven were dead and three were injured.\nThe mass shooting was explored in a 2007 book titled The Lex Street Massacre: The True Story of the Worst Mass Murder in Philadelphia History, by Antonne Jones. Jones took time studying and investigating the case to create his book which includes interviews from judges, lawyers, and even from the men convicted. This non-fiction work goes through the suspense of the case from the first wrongful convictions to the eventual imprisonment of the murderers. The book has interviews with Shihean Black who mentions the effects that living in decaying projects of Philadelphia had on him, and lead to his loss of respect for life and its value. This novel explores the causes, effects, and the importance of the massacre.\nCoordinates: 39\u00b058\u203201\u2033N 75\u00b012\u203243\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff39.967\u00b0N 75.212\u00b0W\ufeff / 39.967; -75.212\n",

Wage cuts in the industry began immediately, and wages were slashed again in early 1894.\nBy the late spring of 1894, the United Mine Workers, which had a mere $2,600 in its treasury and a paid membership of 13,000, called a general strike in the bituminous coal mining industry. The demand was for wages to return to the level they were at on May 1, 1893.\nInitially, the strike was a major success.  More than 180,000 miners in Colorado, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia struck.  In Illinois, 25,207 miners went\non strike, while only 610 continued to work through the strike, with the average Illinois miner out of work for 72 days because of the strike.[2]\nBut the mine owners were unwilling and/or unable to restore wages. Some owners adjusted wages slightly upward, but most refused to budge.\nIn some areas of the country, violence erupted between strikers and mine operators or between striking and non-striking miners.  On May 23 near Uniontown, Pennsylvania, 15 guards armed with carbines and machine guns maliciously attacked a group of 1500 strikers, killing 5 and wounding 8.[3]  On May 24 and 25 in LaSalle, Illinois, a firefight erupted between strikers and 40 sheriff's deputies.  The deputies eventually ran out of ammunition and were forced to flee, most of them wounded.[4]  The situation in LaSalle remained tense into early July, when a posse of 60 well-armed men was raised to fend off a force of 2000 miners.[5]  On June 13 in McLainesville, Ohio (west of Bellaire), strikers armed with stones and clubs clashed with National Guard troops.[6]  In Iowa, the National Guard was mobilized to protect miners in Givens and Muchakinock who had not joined the strike.[7][8][9]\nAs the depression deepened, the miners were unable to hold out. By late June, almost all the miners had returned to work.\nThe strike shattered the United Mine Workers. A year after the strike, the union's secretary-treasurer wrote to the American Federation of Labor (AFL), declaring, 'The National is busted...' The union almost ceased to exist. It suspended publication of its newsletter and ceased paying per capita dues to the AFL.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe 2021 Allegheny Technologies strike was a labor strike involving about 1,300 workers for metals manufacturing company Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI), all unionized with the United Steelworkers (USW). The strike began on March 30 and ended on July 13 with the ratification of a new labor contract. Strikers returned to work by July 19. According to the Northwest Labor Press, the strike was among the country's largest for 2021 by number of strikers involved.[1]\nIn 2020, ATI was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the company reporting over $1 billion in losses for that year. In February of that year, the company's labor contract with the USW (which represented roughly 1,300 employees in nine facilities) expired, but citing the pandemic and a general lack of progress in negotiations for a new contract, the union agreed to extend the expired contract until February 2021. By January of that year, negotiations had resumed, but like before, neither side could come to an agreement, with the main issue concerning the company's health care plan. The company was pushing for workers to pay a monthly premium, while the union was steadfast in objecting to premiums, arguing that adding premiums would negate the pay increase offered in the new contract. Additional issues included concerns over outsourcing and opposition to changes to the company's scheduling and overtime system. On March 5, several days after the extended contract had expired, workers voted to authorize strike action, and on the morning of March 30, they performed a walkout and began picketing.\nOver the next few months, the company and union held on-again off-again negotiations, during which time the main point of contention continued to be the health care plan. In late May, federal mediators became involved, by which point the two sides had settled almost all other issues. On July 6, following several days of intense negotiations, the union announced a tentative agreement with the company that included a guarantee of no premiums in the workers' health care plan. Workers voted to accept the agreement on July 13 and returned to work by July 19. The new contract has generally been seen as a win for the union, as it addresses all of the issues they had had with the company's original proposals. At the same time, the union estimates that the strike cost the company millions of dollars, with the company posting a $49.2 million loss for the second quarter of 2021.\nAllegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI) is an American metals manufacturing company with facilities located throughout the Northern United States.[2] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the company suffered a loss of income of US$1.6 billion and announced plans to cut approximately 400 jobs, with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette describing the company as a \"struggling Pittsburgh-based metals giant\".[2] Going into 2020, several hundred unionized workers, organized under the United Steelworkers (USW), were working under a four-year labor contract that had been approved in 2016 following a six-month lockout, the first in ATI's history.[3][4] This contract expired on February 29, 2020,[4] With negotiations for a new contract starting the previous month.[5][6] However, by March 2020, in light of the pandemic and a lack of progress on negotiations for a new contract, the union agreed to a one-year contract extension that would expire on February 28, 2021.[7] In addition, ATI gave each worker a $500 bonus as a show of good faith in continuing the negotiations with the union.[7] The contract covered approximately 1,300[note 2] workers in nine facilities,[2] located in Waterbury, Connecticut; New Bedford, Massachusetts; Lockport, New York; Louisville, Ohio; and the Pennsylvania locales of Brackenridge, Latrobe, Natrona Heights, Vandergrift, and Washington.[2][note 3]\nIn January 2021, the union and company recommenced negotiations, but similar to the previous year, they struggled to come to an agreement.[9] The company's proposal of an immediate $3,000 payment to workers with an additional 8.5 percent pay raise spread out over the course of the four-year contract was considered too little,[10] especially given that the workers had previously had a seven-year wage freeze.[10][11]  Furthermore, the union alleged that changes to the company's overtime system could cause some workers to work 12-hour shifts while not receiving overtime pay due to not having worked over 40 hours per week.[10] Additional concerns included changes that the union stated would cause some outsourcing of union work to contractors.[10] Workers also complained about the lack of cost-of-living allowances from the company.[12] ATI countered that the proposal would see wage increases while maintaining the workers' premium-free health insurance plan,[13] which was guaranteed for the first three years of the plan and became an option starting in 2024.[14][15] One union member stated that the monthly cost of the premium would have negated the increase in pay.[16] As a result of the impasse, the contract expired without a replacement on February 28 and several days later, on March 5, union members voted to authorize strike action, with about 95 percent in favor.[9] This authorization meant that union leadership could commence a strike without holding an additional round of voting.[2] In the days following the vote, hundreds of union members held multiple rallies at the nine facilities that would be affected.[10] On March 9, the union filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board that the company had been withholding \"essential bargaining information\".[17]\nOn March 26, USW announced that the ATI workers would be going on strike over unfair labor practices starting at 7 a.m. on March 30.[13] This would be the first strike ATI had experienced since a 69-day strike in 1994.[2][13] Following the announcement, ATI stated they would be using remaining salaried employees and interns to continue operations, with one industry analyst speculating that the company would focus on their most profitable products, like titanium.[13] The analyst also speculated that the strike action would hurt ATI and help industry competitors Acerinox and Outokumpu, who operated non-union plants in the right-to-work states of Alabama and Kentucky.[13] In a last-minute effort to avoid the strike, on March 29, the company rescinded portions of the contract that would have changed the contracting system and made changes to its health care proposal, but this offer was also rejected.[18] Additionally, news articles published the day the strike began stated that the company was offering 9 percent wage increase,[11][19][note 4] in addition to a $4,000 lump sum payment.[14]\nAs announced, at 7 a.m. on March 30, approximately 1,300 ATI employees at the nine locations performed a walkout.[14][19][20] Immediately following this, they commenced picketing against the company.[11][15] Within the first day of the strike, union representatives claimed that they had made progress in negotiations and were willing to accept a $4,000 payment alongside 11 percent wage increases over the course of the contract, but were still at odds with the company over the terms of the health care policy.[15] On April 14, USW announced that strikers would qualify for COBRA health care through the American Rescue Plan Act once their ATI plans expire at the end of April.[21] On April 19, union and company representatives met for renewed negotiations.[8] By this time, the company stated that they had withdrawn their proposals regarding outsourcing and scheduling, with health care remaining the main point of contention.[8] However, by April 22, the union had rejected the proposal set forth by the company.[22] Following this, the company gave the union an ultimatum, saying that if the union did not accept the company's proposal by April 26, proposals made by the company would \"begin to reflect the costs incurred by ATI as a result of the strike\".[23] The union still rejected the company's proposal,[24] again citing issues with the company's proposed health care plan.[23] On April 29, about a month into the strike, ATI announced that they had sustained a $7.9 million loss for the first financial quarter of 2021.[25][26][27]\nOn May 6, USW submitted a counterproposal to the company,[28] which was rejected by the company later that same day, with the company calling the offer a \"bait and switch\".[29] By May 14, representatives from both the union and company stated they would be open to mediation through the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.[30] This happened on May 21, with both sides negotiating with a federal mediator present.[31][32][27] Additionally around this time, company representatives claimed that all production orders were being met during the strike, a statement refuted by union representatives, who claimed that customers were placing orders with ATI's competitors.[31] Despite the federal mediation, negotiations continued into June.[33] However, by this time, USW claimed that ATI was no longer actively pushing for the health care premiums and were instead discussing other cost-cutting methods with the health care plan.[33] By June 19 though, negotiations had once again stalled.[34] On June 21, USW's local union in New Bedford held a rally that was widely attended by members of other labor unions in the area and featured Massachusetts State Representative Antonio Cabral speaking out in support of the strikers.[34] USW local unions in other affected areas also held rallies to keep up support for the strike.[35]\n",

The store was open and full of shoppers and staff. Six people died and fourteen others were injured. The construction contractor, Griffin Campbell, and excavator operator, Sean Benschop, were charged with involuntary manslaughter and other charges. They were found guilty of manslaughter, and Campbell and Benschop received prison sentences of 15 years to 30 years, and 7.5 years to 15 years, respectively.\n2138 Market Street, an unoccupied four-story building, had been under demolition by Griffin Campbell Construction for several weeks prior to the collapse. This property is owned by Richard Basciano through his development corporation, STB Investments. 2138 Market was adjacent to the one-story 2140 Market Street building, which had a Salvation Army thrift store operating on the ground and basement levels. The store was open and full of shoppers and staff.[1][2][3][4]\nOn May 31, 2013, the property manager for STB, Thom Simmonds, emailed Plato Marinakos, an architect for STB, stating that Basciano visited that day and noticed no one was working.  He indicated that Basciano would visit the site again that weekend and asked Marinakos to advise. The emails indicated that Basciano returned to the site on June 2 and was pleased to see progress.  An 18-ton motorized excavator had been moved on to the site.  After being granted immunity by the grand jury, Marinakos testified that on June 4, Griffin Campbell called for a progress payment.  Marinakos then went to the site at 6 p.m. on June 4 and was alarmed to see an unsupported brick wall looming next to the Salvation Army building. Marinakos then testified that he told Campbell to take the wall down immediately, \"I was like, 'Griffin, you can't leave this wall here.  This is just crazy. I mean, you can't do that.'\" [5]\nAt 10:43 am, the four-story building under demolition collapsed onto the one-story building next door. The buildings crashed down with crumbling brick and wood snapping. Six people died and 14 people were injured. A 61-year-old woman was trapped for 13 hours and then hospitalized at Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in critical condition.[6]\nThe 13 other injuries were minor.[7][8][9][10]\nAfter the collapse, an 18-year-old high school student who had been walking by the building when it collapsed rushed to the scene and spent 15 minutes trying to free people from the rubble before emergency crews arrived.[10] During a search-and-rescue operation, rescuers used buckets and their bare hands to move through bricks and rubble until the following morning.[3]\nIt was soon discovered that surveillance video from the front of a SEPTA bus operating eastbound on Market Street between 23rd and 22nd Streets had captured the scene at the moment of collapse. Up to a minute of this footage was released by SEPTA to news media outlets in July.[11]\nThe six people killed by the collapse were:[12]\nOn June 12, 2013, Ronald Wagenhoffer, the 52-year-old City Department of Licenses and Inspections inspector responsible for inspecting the demolition site, was found dead in his truck with a gunshot to the chest.  His death was ruled a suicide.[13]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe September 11 attacks, commonly known as 9/11,[d] were four coordinated suicide terrorist attacks carried out by the militant Islamist extremist network al-Qaeda[4][5][6] against the United States on September 11, 2001. That morning, nineteen terrorists hijacked four commercial airliners scheduled to travel from the New England and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States to California. The hijackers crashed the first two planes into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, and the third plane into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States military) in Arlington County, Virginia. The fourth plane was intended to hit a federal government building in Washington, D.C., but crashed in a field following a passenger revolt. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and instigated the global war on terror.\nThe first impact was that of American Airlines Flight 11. It was crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan at 8:46 a.m. Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03,[e] the World Trade Center\u2019s South Tower was hit by United Airlines Flight 175. Both 110-story skyscrapers collapsed within an hour and forty-two minutes, bringing about the destruction of the remaining five structures in the WTC complex, as well as damaging or destroying various other buildings surrounding the towers. A third flight, American Airlines Flight 77, crashed into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, at 9:37 a.m., causing a partial collapse. The fourth and final flight, United Airlines Flight 93, flew in the direction of Washington, D.C. Alerted of the previous attacks, the plane's passengers attempted to gain control of the aircraft, but the hijackers ultimately crashed the plane in a field in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania, near Shanksville at 10:03 a.m. Investigators determined that Flight 93 was targeting either the United States Capitol or the White House.\nWithin hours of the attacks, the Central Intelligence Agency determined that al-Qaeda was responsible. The United States formally responded by launching the war on terror and invading Afghanistan to depose the Taliban, which had not complied with U.S. demands to expel al-Qaeda from Afghanistan and extradite its leader, Osama bin Laden. The U.S.'s invocation of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty\u2014its only usage to date\u2014called upon allies to fight al-Qaeda. As U.S. and NATO ground forces swept through Afghanistan, bin Laden fled to the White Mountains, where he narrowly avoided capture by U.S.-led forces.[11] Although bin Laden initially denied any involvement, in 2004 he formally claimed responsibility for the attacks.[3] Al-Qaeda's cited motivations included U.S. support of Israel, the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, and sanctions against Iraq. After evading capture for almost a decade, bin Laden was killed by the U.S. military on May 2, 2011.\nThe attacks resulted in 2,977 non-hijacker fatalities, an indeterminate number of injuries, and substantial long-term health consequences, in addition to at least $10\u00a0billion in infrastructure and property damage.[12][13] It remains the deadliest terrorist attack in human history and the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in U.S. history, with 343[14] and 72 killed,[15][16] respectively. The destruction of the World Trade Center and its environs seriously harmed the New York City economy and induced global market shocks. Many other countries strengthened anti-terrorism legislation and expanded their powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Cleanup of the World Trade Center site (colloquially \"Ground Zero\") took eight months and was completed in May 2002, while the Pentagon was repaired within a year. After delays in the design of a replacement complex, the One World Trade Center began construction in November 2006 and opened in November 2014.[17][18] Memorials to the attacks include the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City, the Pentagon Memorial in Arlington County, Virginia, and the Flight 93 National Memorial at the Pennsylvania crash site.\nThe origins of al-Qaeda can be traced to 1979 when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Osama bin Laden traveled to the central Asian country[19] to volunteer, viewing the war as a holy cause to help fellow Muslims (in Afghanistan) defeat Communist invaders (the Soviets).[20] Bin Laden organized fellow Arab mujahideen (the \"Afghan Arabs\") to resist the Soviets until that country's exit from Afghanistan in 1989.[21] The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) funneled several billion dollars worth of weapons to the indigenous Afghan mujahideen resistance, a portion of which bled to the Arab volunteers.[22] However, no direct U.S. aid to bin Laden or any of his affiliates has ever been established.[23]\nIn 1996, bin Laden issued his first fatw\u0101, calling for American soldiers to leave Saudi Arabia.[24] In a second fatw\u0101 in 1998, bin Laden outlined his objections to American foreign policy with respect to Israel, as well as the continued presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War.[25] Bin Laden used Islamic texts to exhort Muslims to attack Americans until the stated grievances were reversed. Muslim legal scholars \"have throughout Islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the Muslim countries\", according to bin Laden.[25][26]\nBin Laden orchestrated the attacks. He initially denied involvement, but later recanted his false statements.[3][27][28] Al Jazeera broadcast a statement by him on September 16, 2001: \"I stress that I have not carried out this act, which appears to have been carried out by individuals with their own motivation.\"[29] In November 2001, U.S. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. In the video, bin Laden is seen talking to Khaled al-Harbi and admits foreknowledge of the attacks.[30] On December 27, 2001, a second bin Laden video was released. In the video, he said:\nIt has become clear that the West in general and America in particular have an unspeakable hatred for Islam.\u00a0... It is the hatred of crusaders. Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response to injustice, aimed at forcing America to stop its support for Israel, which kills our people.\u00a0... We say that the end of the United States is imminent, whether Bin Laden or his followers are alive or dead, for the awakening of the Muslim ummah [sic] (nation) has occurred.\u00a0... It is important to hit the economy (of the United States), which is the base of its military power...If the economy is hit they will become reoccupied.",

        "paragraph": "Juan Covington (born March 3, 1962) is an American serial killer responsible for at least five shootings in neighborhoods of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 1998 to 2005, three of which were fatal. Motivated by delusions brought on from his paranoid schizophrenia, Covington was convicted and given three life terms which he is serving to this day.[1]\nJuan Covington was born on March 3, 1962, in Philadelphia's Logan neighborhood, one of two nearly identical brothers. His childhood was reportedly normal until 1990, when his father died.[2] After that point, Covington frequently fell into depressive moods and began taking medication, but after a few years, he suddenly declared himself \"cured\". In contrast to his claims, he started exhibiting strange behavior, ranging from wearing military fatigues and patrolling around his neighborhood for unseen forces to refusing to bathe or wash himself.[2] According to his family members, at one Christmas, he kept gazing at the decorated tree because he thought it was moving. Despite this, he was considered a mostly upstanding citizen who worked as a bus driver for SEPTA for around 18 years, before switching to hauling medical waste for local hospitals. According to neighbors, Covington was a quiet, yet easily offended man, but was otherwise considered fairly normal.[2]\nCovington's first known murder occurred on August 19, 1998, when he used a SIG Sauer to shoot 49-year-old Rev. Thomas Lee Devlin, a Baptist Pastor (who he was in no way related to although this has been falsely reported by multiple media outlets without correction), 13 times in his church on Old York Road.\nThe alleged motive for the killing was that Devlin supposedly used witchcraft to cast evil spells on him. Despite this, Covington later attended Rev. Devlin's funeral and was reportedly very upset at his death.[2]  Even though he knew the victim peripherally, he was not considered a suspect. The case was originally thought to be the result of a child custody dispute between Devlin and an ex-girlfriend although there is no record of any such custody dispute ever having taken place with the mothers of any of Devlin's multiple children.[3]\nFor the next four years, no known crimes were connected to Covington. On May 20, 2003, while walking around Logan, he came across 41-year-old David Stewart. For reasons unknown, Covington pulled out a 9mm pistol and shot at him nine times, paralyzing him from the waist down. Due to this, Stewart was forced to walk on crutches. A similar incident took place on April 26, 2004, when he encountered 32-year-old William Bryant, Jr. on West Ruscomb Street and proceeded to shoot him nine times. Like Stewart, Bryant survived the encounter, but was disabled and now has trouble with speech.[2] For the latter assault, a 32-year-old social worker, Clyde A. Johnson, would be erroneously arrested and kept in detention awaiting trial, where he would remain until Covington was linked to the crimes. The murders would resume on March 7, 2005, when Covington shot and killed 36-year-old Odies Bosket, a clerk for the Revenue Department who was en route to pick up his daughter from a nursery in Logan.[2] Another man, 37-year-old Morris Wells, was charged with the murder and would also be kept in detention until the real killer's capture.[2]\nOn the early morning of May 17, 2005, 48-year-old Patricia \"Trish\" McDermott, a radiographer for the Pennsylvania Hospital, was found shot to death on Market Street by a passing driver.[4] Preliminary investigations pointed that she had been killed with a .380 pistol, but authorities struggled to determine a possible motive, as none of her money or personal possessions were stolen.[5] After collecting CCTV footage from the surrounding buildings, detectives observed McDermott getting off the bus, followed shortly by a man wearing a baseball cap, light jacket and green pants, who seemed to be stalking her. After following her down the block, the man suddenly pulled out a gun and shot her once in the head, killing McDermott on the spot.[6][7]\nAs they were unable to discern neither the suspect's face nor a possible motive for the crime, detectives scoured the surrounding area for additional camera footage in an effort to gather potential clues.[5] After collecting several tapes, they eventually came across a recording from a parking lot that showed the killer running across it and allowed them to map out his escape route. Even with further analysis, they were still unable to determine who he was, and because of this, the police department turned towards the FBI and the NFL Films branch for assistance, but as this produced no viable leads, they eventually resorted to releasing the footage in the hope that somebody would recognized and potentially identify the man.[4]\nThe move proved to be successful, as it generated hundreds of tips, with one of them coming from an employee of a bus company who claimed the man was Juan Covington, a subcontractor at the local Pennsylvania Hospital.[5] Upon reviewing security footage from the hospital's cameras, it was found that he had worn the exact same clothing as the man who had shot McDermott, which allowed the authorities to finally arrest him.[6] In the subsequent interrogations, Covington gave a written statement in which he admitted full responsibility, claiming that he believed McDermott was poisoning him with X-rays, and that he decided to kill because nobody would believe him if he said anything.[5] To the investigators' surprise, Covington then went to admit that he had killed Devlin and Bosket, as well as shooting Stewart and Bryant. A ballistic examination concluded that the victims had been shot with the guns owned by Covington, thus confirming him as a serial killer.[5]\nAfter Covington's arrest and announcement as a suspect in the serial murders, all the men previously arrested in the respective cases had their charges dropped and were subsequently released. While he openly admitted responsibility for the attacks, Covington initially refused to plead guilty, claiming that he was \"the chosen One\" and he had killed the three because he believed them to be devils who were trying to harm him.[1] At trial, his attorney, A. Charles Peruto Jr., noted his client's history of mental illness and a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia in an effort to spare him the death penalty.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nFannie Sellins  (1872 \u2013 August 26, 1919) was an American union organizer.\nBorn Fanny Mooney in New Orleans, Louisiana, she married Charles Sellins in St. Louis, Missouri. After his death she worked in a garment factory to support her four children. She helped to organize Local # 67 of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union in St. Louis, where she became a negotiator for 400 women locked out of a garment factory. Thus she came to the attention of Van Bittner, president of District 5 of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA).\nIn 1913, she moved to begin work for the mine workers union in West Virginia. Her work, she wrote, was to distribute \"clothing and food to starving women and babies, to assist poverty stricken mothers and bring children into the world, and to minister to the sick and close the eyes of the dying.\" She was arrested once in Colliers, West Virginia for defying an anti-union injunction. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson intervened for her release.\nSellins had promised to obey the judge's order against picketing. She returned to Colliers from Fairmont, W.Va. and immediately broke her promise by challenging U.S. District Court Judge Alston G. Dayton to arrest her. He did.\nWith the help of U.S. Congressman Matthew M. Neely, the UMWA waged a public relations campaign to obtain a presidential pardon for Sellins. The union printed thousands of postcards with a photo of Sellins sitting behind the bars of her jail cell in Fairmont. On the back side of the card was the address of the White House.[1]\nPhilip Murray hired Sellins to join the staff of the UMWA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1919, she was assigned to the Allegheny River Valley district to direct picketing by striking miners at Allegheny Coal and Coke Company. On August 26, she witnessed guards beating Joseph Starzeleski, a picketing miner, who was killed. When she intervened, deputies shot and killed her with four bullets, then a deputy used a cudgel to fracture her skull.[2] Others said that she was attempting to protect miners' children that were on scene.[3]\nShe was buried from St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church in New Kensington, Pennsylvania on August 29 and interred at Union Cemetery in Arnold. A coroner's jury in 1919 ruled her death justifiable homicide and blamed Sellins for starting the riot which led to her death although other witnesses portrayed a different event than the deputies at the scene. The union and her family raised money to hire a lawyer to press a criminal investigation and pressure officials to reopen the investigation. A grand jury in Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, indicted three deputies for the killings but a trial in 1923 ended in acquittal for the two men accused of her murder. The actual gunman, John Pearson, never appeared for his trial and never was seen again.[4]\n",

According to police, Ogrod confessed to Horn's murder four years after it occurred, but in 2020 the \"confession\" was recognized to be false. On June 5 of that year, Ogrod's conviction was vacated by the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas and he was ordered to be released from prison.[1] He had spent more than two decades on death row.[1]\nIn April 1992, Walter Ogrod, a neighbor of four-year-old Barbara Jean Horn, confessed to luring Horn into his basement, attempting to sexually assault her, bludgeoning her to death with a metal object and then placing her body in a cardboard television box on nearby St. Vincent Street.[2]\nIn October 1993, Ogrod was prosecuted by Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham for the first time.[3] The defense argued that Ogrod's confession had been coerced by the authorities.[4][5] The jury was set to acquit Ogrod of the crime, but a single juror announced that he did not agree with the verdict as it was being read, resulting in a mistrial.[6]\nIn October 1996, Ogrod again went on trial.[7] He was convicted of her murder on October 8, 1996, and sentenced to death the following day.[8] The main evidence against Ogrod was jailhouse informant hearsay testimony that he had confessed to the crime.[9][10]\nIn December 2003, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed Ogrod's death sentence in an opinion by Justice Sandra Schultz Newman.[11] In April 2004, that court denied Ogrod's application for reargument in an unsigned order, with Justice Thomas G. Saylor writing for the three dissenters.[12]\nIn April 2018, the new Philadelphia District Attorney, Larry Krasner, revealed that Ogrod's conviction would be reviewed. In addition, a district attorney spokesman revealed that prosecutors would no longer try to prevent DNA evidence in the case from being tested, including fingernail scrapings from the victim.[13] DNA testing was concluded in January 2020, with the results definitively excluding Ogrod as the source.[14] In light of the new DNA test results, Krasner filed a motion to have Ogrod's 1996 murder conviction overturned, which was set to go before a judge on March 27, 2020.[15] However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was delayed until June 2020.[16]  On June 5, 2020, Ogrod's conviction was vacated by the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, and he was ordered to be released from prison.[1][17]\nThe case was featured on a first-season episode of Unsolved Mysteries, aired on November 16, 1988. As implied, at the time the case was unsolved, and there was not yet a clear suspect.[18]\nIn April 2017, a book by author Thomas Lowenstein (son of Allard K. Lowenstein), The Trials of Walter Ogrod, was published.[19]\n",

Melcroft has a post office with ZIP code 15462, which opened on September 13, 1918.[2][3]\nThe community's name is an amalgamation of Mellon and Croft, surnames of businessmen in the local mining industry.[4]\nIn 2018, a mass shooting at a car wash left five people dead, including the perpetrator, and a sixth person with minor injuries. The incident occurred on January 28, 2018, at Ed's Car Wash, just before 3:00\u00a0a.m., in the Melcroft community of Saltlick Township, south-east of Pittsburgh. There was supposed to be a fistfight between Smith and Porterfield but the other victims did not have any idea what was going on according to police. Chelsie Cline, 25, her half-brother, Seth Cline, 21, her boyfriend at the time, William \"Billy\" Porterfield, 27, a friend, Cortney Snyder, 23, and another unidentified woman, met with 28-year-old Timothy O\u2019Brien Smith at the car wash. Smith had previously been in a relationship with Cline and reportedly had an ongoing feud with Porterfield who was her current boyfriend at the time.[5] Surveillance video had shown Smith grabbing Porterfield from behind earlier that morning at the Tall Cedars bar. Smith arrived at the car wash wearing a body armor carrier without the ballistic panels, and was armed with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, a .308-caliber rifle, and a 9mm handgun.[6]\nSmith opened fire on the victims with both his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and 9mm handgun. First, he killed both Cline and Porterfield, by gunning them down in the car wash's parking lot after they stepped out of their sedan. He then killed Snyder and Cline's half-brother as they sat in their pickup truck. The unidentified woman with them sat in the back of the vehicle survived after being taken to hospital.[7] In total, three vehicles were towed from the location, two were pickup trucks and the other was a sedan. After killing four people, Smith turned the gun on himself and shot himself in the head. He initially survived, but later died at a hospital just before 10:00\u00a0p.m.[8] At the time, it was the deadliest shooting in the U.S. in the year 2018, until it was surpassed by the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting just seventeen days later.[9]\n\nThis Fayette County, Pennsylvania state location article is a stub.

He is the first man from Philadelphia in modern history to receive a federal death sentence. He has twelve convictions for murder in aid of racketeering, one fewer than the Pennsylvania state record, and the most for anyone in Philadelphia.[4] Savage was the first person sentenced to death by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania since the federal death penalty resumed in 1988.[5][6]\nSavage, a former student of Frankford High School, began boxing at the Front Street Gym in North Philadelphia. He had one professional boxing fight, which he won.[3] Savage's father died of cancer when he was 13 years old.[7]\nSavage began his operations as a drug dealer in Hunting Park and became a higher-level dealer.[4] According to federal authorities, Savage, from 1998 to around 2004 distributed hundreds of kilograms of cocaine in the Philadelphia area.[8]\nAuthorities accused Savage of personally killing a stranger, Kenneth Lassiter, after Lassiter's car bumped into Savage's while the two were trying to park their respective cars.[4] Savage was acquitted of Lassiter's murder after the lead witness in the case, Tybius \"Tib\" Flowers, was also murdered. Savage is suspected of ordering Flowers's murder.[8]\nSavage ordered the deaths of others, including that of Carlton Brown, a drug dealer and competitor of Savage who was shot by hitman Lamont Lewis in 2001. Savage also ordered five other deaths of adult men[4] and engaged in multiple attempts at intimidation while held at Federal Detention Center, Philadelphia (FDC Philadelphia,), [9] threatening to kill children of those who testified against him.[2]\nLess than one week after he was acquitted in the Lassiter case, Savage was arrested and accused of heading a drug trafficking network.[8] He was convicted of 14 out of 16 charges and received a 30-year sentence.[10][11] Savage was convicted of multiple charges, including money laundering, witness intimidation, and drug offenses.[12] Savage was imprisoned in a federal facility near Florence, Colorado.[13]\nSavage's daughter, Ciara \"CeCe\" Savage, a student at Ross Elementary School, died at age 9 during a gang shooting in York, Pennsylvania. Police and Jasmine Vadell, Ciara's mother, said the shooting was unrelated to Savage's gang activities in Philadelphia. Vadell had raised Ciara alone and had not been romantically involved with Savage for years.[2]\nEugene \"Twin\" Coleman,[9] who was previously working with Savage, was arrested and put in federal custody on October 8, 2004 and agreed to testify against Savage in a drug trial. [14] In March 2003, after Coleman murdered his friend, 26-year-old Tyrone Toliver of Cherry Hill, New Jersey,[12] federal agents encouraged Coleman's 54-year-old mother,[4] Marcella Coleman, a prison guard at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility,[12] to move to a new house; believing that she could defend herself, she refused.[14] Savage was convicted partly due to Coleman's testimony.[12]\nIn return, Savage ordered Marcella Coleman's house in North Philadelphia to be burned down.[15] At the time, Savage was in custody at FDC Philadelphia.[13] At about 5 \u2060a.m. on October 9, 2004, the rowhouse was firebombed. The fire originated in a living room on the first floor, traveled quickly, and was extinguished after about 20 minutes.[12] There were no survivors;[16] it was the deadliest mass murder in Philadelphia since the Lex Street murders in 2000.[12] Included in the death toll were Coleman; her 15-month-old son Damir Jenkins; three other youths\u2009\u2060related to Coleman,\u2009\u206010-year-old Khadjah Nash, 12-year-old Tahj Porchea, and 15-year-old Sean Rodriguez\u2009\u2060; and 34-year-old Tameka Nash, Coleman's cousin and the mother of Khadjah Nash.[4] The family dog, a pit bull, also perished.[17]\n",

        "paragraph": "The General Strike of 1910 was a labor strike by trolley workers of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company that grew to a citywide riot and general strike in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[1][2]\nOn May 29, 1909 a committee of the local AFL affiliate Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees of America approached officials of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company (PRT) with demands for an hourly wage of 25 cents for motormen and conductors, the right to buy their uniforms on the open market, limits of workdays to 9 or 10 hours and recognition of the Association. Officials at PRT refused to meet with the committee, triggering a strike.[3]:\u200ap143\u200a\n\nPRT responded by bringing in strike breakers from New York City and Boston, notably strikebreakers working for Pearl Bergoff near the beginning of his career as \"King of the Strikebreakers\".[4]  Violence broke out, with trolley cars, tracks and wiring destroyed, police brutality and wholesale arrests of strikers. Given the population's general dislike of the company for poor service, mismanagement and backroom political dealings, the union felt safe issuing an ultimatum. John J. Murphy of the Central Labor Union issued the terms:If the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company does not meet the demands of the trolley workers by Thursday night (June 7), a strike of all organized labor bodies of Philadelphia affiliated with the Central Labor Union, representing 75,000 men, will be called for Friday morning. The present strike is only a beginning of the fight which will be waged by organized labor to emancipate the city of Philadelphia from the thraldom of capitalism.[3]:\u200ap144\u200aState Senator James P. McNichol met with the union and Mayor Reyburn urged PRT to settle. On June 2, 1909, an agreement was announced. The workers received a wage increase from 21 to 22 cents per hour, a ten-hour work day, the right to buy uniforms from five clothiers and recognition of the union. The company, however, soon ignored one of the key terms of the deal by establishing a replacement union, refusing to meet with representatives of Amalgamated and giving choice jobs and promotions to members of PRT's union.[3]:\u200ap144\u200a\nIn December 1909 the Amalgamated union made new demands for a wage increase to 25 cents an hour. PRT flatly refused and on January 1, 1910, without union discussion, announced a complicated \"welfare plan\" for the workers; keeping the 22 cents an hour pay rate and adding insurance and pension provisions. Two days later, the company fired seven workers for announcing they were joining Amalgamated and denouncing the welfare provisions as the company's attempt to undermine union demands. Amalgamated requested arbitration, which the company refused. A strike vote was called. With over 5,300 votes cast, the strike was approved with less than 5% voting against. The strike resolution charged PRT with creating \"dissention and discord\" by forming the company-controlled union, favoring employees antagonistic to Amalgamated, refusing to address grievances, attempting to prevent workers from joining Amalgamated, firing workers who joined and refusing arbitration. The resolution left the timing of the actual strike to Amalgamated's Executive Board. Local newspapers, citing the near unanimity of the vote and the union's obvious strength, urged PRT to give the situation urgent attention. PRT issued a statement saying \"The strike vote will not change the attitude of the company the slightest.\" Mayor Reyburn endorsed the company's position, calling the union members \"semi-public functionaries\" who owe their service to the city.[3]:\u200ap145\u200a\nNegotiations slowly got under way and labored on until mid-February. AFL President Samuel Gompers urged PRT to join the union in arbitration to reach a settlement. PRT dismissed the offer saying they had the situation under control and stating they intended to uphold the rights of workers to join or not join a union of their choosing and breaking off negotiations. On February 19, 1910, PRT fired 173 workers, all of them members of the union, \"for the good of the service\" and hired replacement workers from New York City.[3]:\u200ap146\u200a Immediately after the firings, the union leadership ordered the strike, taking their respective trolley cars off the streets effective at 1:00 that afternoon.\nOn the first day of the strike, Mayor Reyburn dispatched heavy police guard to the trolley barns. The union claimed 6,200 of the PRT's 7,000 employees walked out. PRT claimed 3,000 workers remained on the job.[1]\nIt was reported worldwide that one volunteer motorman, \"driving his car full-speed through the crowd with one hand on the controller and the other holding a revolver, was dragged from the platform when the car had been wrecked by a spiked switch, and killed\".[5]\n",

Bush invoked Beamer's words: \"Some of our greatest moments have been acts of courage for which no one could have been prepared. But we have our marching orders. My fellow Americans, let's roll!\"[2] He used them again in the 2002 State of the Union address: \"For too long our culture has said, 'If it feels good, do it.' Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: 'Let's roll.'\"[3]\n",

In September 1995, Fairley murdered Lisa Marie Manderach, aged 29, and her 18-month-old daughter Devon, when the two visited Fairley's mother's Collegeville, Pennsylvania children's clothing store in which he worked.[1]\nOn September 10, 1995, Fairley was working alone at Your Kidz & Mine, the Collegeville children's clothing store owned by his parents. Just before closing time, Lisa Marie Manderach (born September 30, 1965) and her daughter Devon (born February 4, 1994) entered the store.[2] When Fairley realized that they were the only customers present, he locked the doors to the store. He then attempted to sexually assault Lisa Manderach. When she resisted him, he became enraged and strangled her to death. He also strangled her infant daughter.[3][4] After the murder, he sexually abused Manderach's corpse, then went to an Electric Hellfire Club concert that he had been planning to attend that night.[5]\nLisa Manderach had told her husband where she was going. When she did not return home, he contacted local police, who found her car parked outside the store. A search of Your Kidz & Mine revealed stacks of pornography stained with what appeared to be blood and long black hairs consistent with Manderach's. Similar hairs were found in the store's vacuum cleaner. Also present was a large damp spot on the carpet that was later determined to be saliva. The police also noted that peepholes had been drilled into the dressing rooms. Fairley was charged on September 12, 1995 with the murders of the mother and daughter.[6]\nWhen police questioned Fairley, he was wearing a thick coat of makeup on his face. When detectives told him to wipe it off, his face was covered with scratch marks. When they were pointed out to Fairley by authorities, he said he received them in a mosh pit while attending an Electric Hellfire Club concert, at a local club called the Asylum.[7]\nWhen hikers discovered Devon Manderach's strangled body dumped on a hill at Valley Forge National Park, Fairley was charged with two counts of murder and one count of abusing a corpse.[8] Fairley entered a plea bargain in which prosecutors would not seek the death penalty if he would show them the location of Lisa Manderach's body. Fairley upheld his end of the bargain. [2]\nFairley was tried in April 1996 and convicted on two counts of first-degree murder.\nOn July 24, 1996, Montgomery County Court judge William Carpenter handed down the maximum sentence, two consecutive life terms without chance of parole.[9][10] Fairley is currently incarcerated at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Fayette in LaBelle, Pennsylvania.[11]\nResidents of Limerick, Pennsylvania, raised more than $250,000 over a two-year period to create the Manderach Memorial Playground in honor of Lisa and Devon Manderach; it was dedicated on September 12, 1998.[12][13][14]\nThe Court TV crime documentary series Forensic Files reported on the evidence directly linking Fairley to the murders in the season 6, episode 30 \"Shopping\u00a0Spree\", which aired December 10, 2001.[15]\n[16][17]\n",

He later called Dorothy and told her that he would not arrive home until late. When he returned home, he was very surprised to find his two children, Edward and Marcy, clinging together in a bedroom. They were both crying \"Mommy's gone!\" Marcy told her father that roughly 15 minutes prior, she had been woken by a noise and had gone downstairs, where she had seen a middle-aged man in a brown, peaked cap carrying her unconscious mother down the stairs over his shoulder. When she asked him what he was doing, he patted her head and told her, \"Go back to sleep, little one. Your mom is fine.\"[1][2][3][4] He then left and locked the door.[5]\nPolice initially doubted Marcy's story, but believed it after a psychiatrist interviewed her and confirmed she was apparently telling the truth. The theory first posited by police was that someone with a grudge against her husband due to his job had targeted her. This was seen as most likely given that five years previously, a home intruder had stolen nothing but had severely assaulted Dorothy. On this occasion, too, nothing was stolen from the house.[3] No fingerprints were left behind by the intruder, nor were there any signs of forced entry, just as in the previous assault.[3] A large search was conducted to find Forstein, as the police asked for a check of all unidentified women and requested reports from hospitals (including mental hospitals), hotels, morgues and convalescent homes all across the country.[3] Captain James Kelly of Philadelphia's detective bureau sent out 10,000 notices to police departments and institutions with the description of Forstein.[6]\n",

Her body was discovered in her Lancaster, Pennsylvania, home by her mother Hazel Show with her throat having been slit.[2] Her classmates Lisa Michelle Lambert, Tabitha Buck, and Lawrence \"Butch\" Yunkin were all subsequently charged with her murder.\nLambert initially began harassing Show in 1991, after learning that Show had briefly dated Yunkin over the summer. Lambert and Yunkin had a previous relationship, but had reportedly not been dating during the time Yunkin was dating Show. Show and Yunkin had gone on a few dates, with Show reporting to her mother that Yunkin had date raped her.[3] Shortly after his final date with Show, Yunkin resumed dating Lambert, who was pregnant with his child. Reported to be \"obsessively jealous\" of Show, Lambert proceeded to harass Show in various ways, such as appearing at Show's job and verbally assaulting her.[4] Witnesses reported that Lambert had expressed an intent to \"scare Laurie, then hurt her, then slit her throat\".[5]\nOn December 20, 1991, Laurie Show was discovered, fatally wounded, in her home by her mother. Police later recorded that Show had received \"a five-inch gash to the throat; a stab wound that punctured a lung and another that grazed her spine; several wounds to the head; and a number of defensive wounds\". An autopsy showed that Show's left common carotid artery had been severed. [6] Hazel Show was not at home at the time of the attack, having been duped by the killers into going to the high school to speak to a guidance counselor.[7] Show's mother reported to the police that her daughter had named Lambert as her killer, saying, \"Michelle did it\". Shortly after, Show bled to death. [8]\nPolice arrested Lambert, Yunkin, and Lambert's friend, Tabitha Buck, at a local bowling alley later that day for the murder of Show. While in police custody, the detectives and police take notes and photographs of all three suspects. The police and detectives notice that Lisa Michelle Lambert has not one defensive wound on her, while Tabitha Buck had many, including fresh scratch marks on her face and scratch marks in her right shoulder. Lawrence Yunkin also had a few defensive wounds. For such a violent crime against Laurie Show, all three suspects should've had defensive wounds but Lisa Lambert had none. [9] Initial statements from the three claimed that Yunkin had dropped Lambert and Buck off at Show's house, where the two girls murdered Show. Yunkin stated that he had not participated in the murder, and that, while he was aware that Lambert and Buck planned to cut Show's hair with the knife as a prank, he did provide them with an alibi, as well as helping to dispose of evidence.[10] Lambert and Buck would later recant their initial statements, with Lambert claiming that an abusive Yunkin had encouraged her to harass and assault Show.[6]\nA few weeks after the crime, an earring back was found in the room of Laurie Show , which was found to belong to Lawrence Yunkin. This evidence was turned over the police and was eventually somehow lost in evidence.\nLambert, Buck, and Yunkin were each tried for the murder of Laurie Show. Yunkin agreed to testify against Lambert, stating that she and Buck had slit Show's throat after the two had punctured one of Show's lungs.[11] A pair of sweatpants Lambert had worn during the crime were entered into evidence by the prosecution, as Show's blood was present on them.[12] Another exhibit was a letter from Lambert to Yunkin, in which Lambert states, \"I know I'm not an angel, but Lawrence, I never got mad enough to kill.\"[11]\nLambert was convicted on July 20, 1992 of first-degree murder and criminal conspiracy in the death of Show.[13] Buck was convicted of similar charges, and both young women were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[14]\nLambert was initially incarcerated at Cambridge Springs State Correctional Institution, while Buck was sent to Muncy State Correctional Institution.[15] Yunkin received a lesser sentence for his testimony and was granted parole in 2003.[16]\nLambert appealed the 1992 conviction, and in 1997, appeared in court for a federal habeas corpus hearing.[12] U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell presided over the trial. Lambert's lawyers claimed there were several inconsistencies with the evidence and testimony given in the earlier trial, and that Lambert was innocent. Lambert claimed she had been framed by Lancaster police officers in order to keep her from coming forward with charges that they had gang-raped her.[17]\nA huge amount of Evidence provided at the hearing included the sweatpants entered into the 1992 proceeding as well as correspondence between Yunkin and Lambert where Yunkin admits in his own handwriting that he and Tabitha Buck killed Laurie Show and asked Lambert to take blame for him, because she'll get less time because she is a female. While understand the police and prosecutors consistently contradicted themselves and their story. While on the stand a police officer stated that he never found a pink trash bag which would prove with evidence of Lawrence Yunkin proving he was involved in the crime. A video tape was shown of this officer on the stand finding the pink trash bag with the evidence. Another key point in that the murder victim's mother Hazel show told the judge that she had in fact seen Lawrence yunkin at the crime scene on the morning of the murder and had in fact told police this and the police told Miss hazel show not to worry about it.  Dalzell overturned the murder conviction on April 15, 1997, citing that \"prosecutorial misconduct\" had resulted in an incorrect ruling.[6] Dalzell also barred the state of Pennsylvania from re-trying Lambert.[12] Dalzell's ruling was later overturned in January 1998 by a federal appeals panel that stated that Lambert had \"not yet exhausted her appeals in state court\" and Lambert was taken back to prison.[18]\n",

In 1868, he emigrated to the United States, where he began operating a tavern in the eastern Pennsylvania town of Tamaqua. Campbell later moved to Storm Hill in Lansford, where he served as a recruiter for the Ancient Order of Hibernians.[4] He became a hotel owner, and liquor distributor,[5] and was allegedly a member of the Mollies.[2] This was a term used in the Pennsylvanian coal mining counties Carbon and Schuylkill by miners, mainly Irish immigrants, to describe those who took part in organized labor movements and violently resisted conscription.[4]\nThe Molly Maguires were generally seen, outside their circle of supporters, as murderers, terrorists, and foreign agitators.[6] In 1877, along with three other men (Michael Doyle, John Donahue and Edward Kelly), Campbell was convicted of the murders of John P. Jones and Morgan Powell,[1] but he admitted to only being an accessory.[7] Evidence collected was presented by a single detective from the Pinkerton Agency.[6]\nThe convicts were taken to Carbon County Jail, and Campbell was assigned to cell #17.[3] For days they were forced to listen to the noise made whilst the gallows were being built, outside in the courtyard. On the morning of execution, the courtyard was packed with people. The convicts kept their dignity, but when the guards went to fetch Campbell, he tried one last time to proclaim his innocence.[6] When they refused to let him go, he put his hand in the dirt, and marked the wall with it, stating the mark would remain forever as a sign of his innocence. All four men were then hanged.[2]\nThe handprint Campbell left is still there today, although the wall has been washed, painted over, and, according to some versions, even knocked down and replaced. A forensic scientist who examined the handprint with infrared photography in the 1990s concluded that it had never been  painted over, and stated that the history of Campbell's execution suggests a right hand print on the wall, rather than the left hand print that  is currently visible.[3] The prison is listed on the National Register of Historic labor conflicts.[8]\nBoth branches of the Pennsylvania legislature have passed resolutions (House Resolution No. 527, Session of 2005,[9] and Senate Resolution No. 235 Session of 2006)[10] asserting that the trial of Campbell and the three other accused Molly Maguires was \"inherently unconstitutional.\"\n",

Wecht, who famously challenged the single-bullet theory of the John F. Kennedy assassination, reviewed the case and determined it was \"strongly suspicious of homicide\" also stated, \"I don't know how they wrote this off as a suicide.\"[4] Similarly, forensic scientist Henry Lee, who testified for the defense in the O. J. Simpson murder trial reviewed the case files and concluded, \"[t]he number and types of wounds and bloodstain patterns observed are consistent with a homicide scene.\"[4]\nOne significant point of contention were the stab wounds that penetrated Ellen Greenberg's brain. Dr. Wayne K. Ross wrote that the stab wounds to the brain and spinal cord would have caused severe pain, cranial nerve dysfunction, and traumatic brain injuries.[9] The original medical report stated that neuropathologist Dr. Lucy Rorke-Adams determined there was no such wound. However, when interviewed by The Philadelphia Inquirer, Dr. Rorke revealed she did not observe Greenberg's body and confirmed she has no records (bill, invoice, or report) of the examination.[9]\nIn October 2019, Ellen Greenberg's parents filed a civil suit against the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's Office and Dr. Marlon Osbourne, the pathologist who conducted the autopsy, in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas.[6] The suit seeks to change the manner of death to \"homicide\" or \"undetermined\" citing new information and the fact that Dr. Osbourne admitted to changing the manner of death at the insistence of the police.[6] A new technology called photogrammetry, unavailable at the time of Ellen's death, created a 3D anatomical recreation of Ellen's wounds, demonstrating that not all 20 wounds could have been self-inflicted.[11]\nEllen Greenberg's parents scored a significant legal victory in January 2020, when the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas allowed the case to proceed past the motion to dismiss stage.[12] The trial is set to begin in 2021.[13]\nIn August 2022, the Chester County District Attorney\u2019s office announced it would reopen investigation into Greenberg\u2019s death. This was on the heels of the Pennsylvania Attorney General\u2019s statement that they were relinquishing the case due to a conflict of interest.[14]\nFollowing The Philadelphia Inquirer investigation, the case became a sensation in the true crime community. Ellen Greenberg's story was featured in the Dr. Oz Show,[15] People Magazine,[16] 48 Hours,[9] Inside Edition,[17] The Philadelphia Inquirer, CBS Philadelphia,[18] Good Day Philadelphia (FOX29 Philly),[19] ABC Harrisburg, CBS Harrisburg, Penn Live, NBC's Oxygen network, the Daily Mail (UK), Law.com, and FreakTV (Portuguese).[20] The suspicion surrounding Greenberg's death was also the lead episode in second season of the true crime television show, Accident, Suicide Or Murder.[21]\n",

The township takes its name from the stony creek, which flows through it and represents its western boundary. The stream takes its name from the rocky bed over which it flows for a great part of its course. Its Indian name was Sinne-Hanne or Achsin-Hanne. Hanne means a stream and especially a swift mountain stream.[citation needed] The population was 2,089 at the 2020 census.[2] It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, metropolitan statistical area.\nStonycreek Township garnered global attention during the September 11 attacks when United Airlines Flight 93, intended to strike the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., crashed into a field near downtown after civilian passengers on the flight from Newark, New Jersey to San Francisco International Airport rebelled against the flight's Al-Qaeda terrorist hijackers.\nWhat is now Stonycreek Township was settled in 1762. Most old records call it Stony Creek. The Township was incorporated in 1792 from portions of Quemahoning Township as the last of the six original townships of Somerset County.\nGlessner Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.[3]\nStonycreek Township gained global attention on September 11, 2001, when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed there. Flight 93 was one of four airliners hijacked that day as part of the Al-Qaeda terrorist attack on the United States. It is widely held that the Flight 93 hijackers intended to use the craft to target the United States Capitol. The crash resulted after the passengers of the plane attacked the hijackers in an effort to gain control of the aircraft, resulting in the terrorists deliberately crashing it to prevent them from gaining the upper hand. They learned of the plane's intended fate through cell phone calls to and from family members. All 44 people aboard the plane, including four hijackers, were killed. The site is now the location of a national memorial honoring the passengers.[4]\nThe original temporary memorial to the passengers and crew of Flight 93 was located on a hill, about 500 yards from the crash site. On July 8, 2010, a new temporary entrance and memorial were opened at an area called \"The Western Overlook\". It is where the FBI set up their command center and where family members first saw the aftermath of the crash, bringing their own memorials, where visitors can leave them today. The initial phase of permanent construction of the Flight 93 National Memorial, including the visitor's center, was to be completed by the 10th anniversary in 2011. The first phase of the permanent memorial was completed, opened, and dedicated on September 10, 2011. The current design for the memorial is a modified version of the entry Crescent of Embrace by Paul and Milena Murdoch. The memorial was built around the crash site, following the plane's flight path, and protects the area of impact, known as the \"Sacred Ground\", which will remain protected and accessible only to family members of the passengers and crew.\nStonycreek Township is located approximately at 40.01\u00b0N by 78.88\u00b0W, about 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) west-southwest of Indian Lake, Pennsylvania. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 61.4\u00a0square miles (159.1\u00a0km2), of which 61.2\u00a0square miles (158.4\u00a0km2) is land and 0.3\u00a0square miles (0.7\u00a0km2) (0.44%) is water. It is bordered to the northeast by Shade Township, to the northwest by Quemahoning Township, to the west by Somerset Township, to the southwest by Brothersvalley Township, and to the east by Allegheny Township. Pennsylvania Route 31 runs along the township's southwestern border with Brothersvalley Township and passes into Allegheny Township to the east. U.S. Route 30 / the Lincoln Highway runs along the township's northeastern border with Shade Township. Pennsylvania Route 160 passes through Stonycreek Township as it heads northeast from Brothersvalley Township to Shade Township. Route 160 and Route 31 intersect in Roxbury, and Route 160 and U.S. Route 30/Lincoln Highway intersect in Reels Corner.\nAs of the 2020 census,[6] of 2000, there were 2,221 people, 820 households, and 634 families residing in the township.  The population density was 36.3 people per square mile (14.0/km2).  There were 1,033 housing units at an average density of 16.9/sq\u00a0mi (6.5/km2).  The racial makeup of the township was 98.96% White, 0.09% African American, 0.32% Native American, 0.14% Asian, 0.05% from other races, and 0.45% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.23% of the population.\nThere were 820 households, out of which 35.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 68.3% were married couples living together, 5.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.6% were non-families. 18.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

During the September 11 attacks in 2001, he was a passenger on board United Airlines Flight 93. Bingham was among the passengers who, along with Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett and Jeremy Glick, formed the plan to retake the plane from the hijackers, and led the effort that resulted in the crash of the plane into a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, thwarting the hijackers' plan to crash the plane into a building in Washington, D.C., most likely either the U.S. Capitol Building or the White House.[2]\nHis heroic efforts on United Flight 93, as well as his athletic physique,[3] were noted for having prompted a reassessment of gay stereotypes.[4][5][6][7][8][9]\nMark Bingham was born in 1970, the only child of Alice Hoagland and Gerald Bingham. When Mark was two years old, his parents divorced. Raised by his mother and her family, Mark grew up in Miami, Florida, and Southern California before moving to the San Jose area in 1983. Bingham was an aspiring filmmaker, and as a teenager he began using a video camera as a personal diary to document his life and those of his family and friends. He graduated from Los Gatos High School as a two-year captain of his rugby team in 1988. As an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, Bingham played on two of Coach Jack Clark's national-championship-winning rugby teams in the early 1990s. He also joined the Chi Psi fraternity, eventually becoming its president. Upon graduation at the age of 21, Bingham came out as gay to his family and friends.[10][11]\nA large athlete at 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (193\u00a0cm) and 225 pounds (102\u00a0kg), Bingham also played for the gay-inclusive rugby union team San Francisco Fog RFC.[12] Bingham played No. 8 in their first two friendly matches. He played in their first tournament, and taught his teammates his favorite rugby songs.[13]\nAt the time of his death, Bingham had recently opened a satellite office of his public relations firm in New York City and was spending more time on the East Coast. He discussed plans with his friend Scott Glaessgen to form a New York City rugby team, the Gotham Knights.[14][15]\nOn the morning of September 11, Bingham overslept and nearly missed his flight, on his way to San Francisco to be an usher in his fraternity brother Joseph Salama's wedding.[16] He arrived at Terminal A at Newark International Airport at 7:40 am, ran to Gate 17, and was the last passenger to board United Airlines Flight 93, taking seat 4D, next to passenger Tom Burnett.[17][18]\nUnited Airlines Flight 93 was scheduled to depart at 8:00 am, but the plane did not depart until 42 minutes later due to runway traffic delays. Four minutes later, American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center's North Tower. Fifteen minutes later, at 9:03 am, as United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower, Flight 93 climbed to cruising altitude, heading west over New Jersey and into Pennsylvania. At 9:25 am, Flight 93 was above eastern Ohio, and pilots Jason Dahl and LeRoy Homer received an alert, \"Beware of cockpit intrusion,\" on the cockpit computer device ACARS (Aircraft Communications and Reporting System).[19] Three minutes later, Cleveland controllers could hear screams over the cockpit's open microphone. Moments later, the hijackers, led by the Lebanese Ziad Jarrah, took over the plane's controls and told passengers, \"Keep remaining sitting. We have a bomb on board\". Bingham and the other passengers were herded into the back of the plane. Within six minutes, the plane changed course and headed for Washington, D.C. Several of the passengers made phone calls to loved ones, who informed them about the two planes that had crashed into the World Trade Center.[20][21]\nAfter the hijackers veered the plane sharply south, the passengers decided to act.[20] Bingham, along with Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett and Jeremy Glick, formed a plan to take the plane back from the hijackers.[2] They relayed this plan to their loved ones and the authorities via telephone. Bingham got through to his aunt's home in California.[22] Bingham stated, \"This is Mark Bingham. I want to let you guys know that I love you, in case I don't see you again...I'm on United Airlines, Flight 93. It's being hijacked.\"[23][24][25][26] According to The Week, Hoagland formed the impression that her son spoke \"confidentially\" with a fellow passenger, to form a plan to retake the plane.[22] According to ABC News, the call cut off after about three minutes. Hoagland, after seeing news reports of the plane's hijacking, called him back and left two messages for him, calmly saying, \"Mark, this is your mom. The news is that it's been hijacked by terrorists. They are planning to probably use the plane as a target to hit some site on the ground. I would say go ahead and do everything you can to overpower them, because they are hellbent. Try to call me back if you can.\"[27] Bingham, Burnett, and Glick were each more than 6 feet (1.83\u00a0m) tall, well-built and fit. As they made their decision to retake the plane, Glick related this over the phone to his wife, Lyz.[28][29] Fellow passenger Todd Beamer, speaking to GTE-Verizon Lisa Jefferson and the FBI, related that he too was part of this group.[24][29] They were joined by other passengers, including Lou Nacke, Rich Guadagno, Alan Beaven, Honor Elizabeth Wainio, Linda Gronlund, and William Cashman, along with flight attendants Sandra Bradshaw and Cee Cee Ross-Lyles, in discussing their options and voting on a course of action, ultimately deciding to storm the cockpit and take over the plane.[17][20][21]\n",

        "paragraph": "Antonio Rodriguez (born October 28, 1988), known as The Kensington Strangler, is an American serial killer who was convicted of raping and killing three women from November to December 2010, all of which occurred within a 10-block radius of Philadelphia's Kensington neighborhood. For his crimes, Rodriguez was sentenced to three life terms, which he is currently serving at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Rockview in Benner Township, Pennsylvania.[1]\nOn November 3, 2010, the half-naked body of 21-year-old Elaine Goldberg, a nursing student at the Gwynedd Mercy University who had recently recovered from a drug addiction, was found in a parking lot on Ruth Street.[2] Ten days later, the body of 35-year-old prostitute Nicole Piacenti, of Port Richmond, was found in similar circumstances less than a mile away from where Goldberg's body was located.[3] While police initially claimed that there was no indication that the two murders were connected, test conducted on DNA collected from both crime scenes was later matched to the same unknown perpetrator.[4] Upon announcing this, several other local women came forward and claimed that they had been assaulted by a stranger.[4]\nOn December 15, the half-naked body of a third victim, 27-year-old Casey Mahoney of Asheville, North Carolina, was found in a patch of woods near some railroad tracks of the Kensington area.[5] Like his previous victims, she struggled with a drug addiction from which she was trying to recover. She was dumped in isolated areas and was sexually assaulted. The similarities in the three murders started rumors that a serial killer was roaming the streets, putting pressure on the police in order to catch the assailant.[6]\nTwo days after Mahoney's murder, Philadelphia police released CCTV footage of a man suspected of assaulting a woman in Kensington on December 6, saying that the suspect could be connected to the recent murders in the area.[7] The video showed what appeared to be a black male in his early 20s with long sideburns, who walked with a characteristic gait and supposedly said to his assault victim that his name was \"Anthony\".[7]\nAn anonymous tip led to the arrest of a homeless vagrant, 22-year-old Antonio Rodriguez, who had been released from the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility on August 29, 2010, after serving a 3-month term for a felony drug charge.[8] As a felon, he was obligated to submit his DNA into CODIS on October 25, but as the Philadelphia police had a backlog of more than 5,000 cases, they were unable to link him to the murders until January 10.[9] Rodriguez was arrested in the kitchen of an abandoned house on January 17 by a joint team of detectives and marshals.[10] In his subsequent confessions, Rodriguez claimed that he initially met the victims to use their services, but during the acts, he would start to choke and beat them until they eventually died. He also acknowledged that, even though he knew they were already dead, he nonetheless continued to have sex with their corpses.[11]\nThe delay in his arrest caused controversy due to the time DNA processing took place, with estimates suggesting that if it had been processed fast enough, Rodriguez could have been arrested before he killed Mahoney. The backlash led to calls for some funds to be allocated to the Philadelphia Police Department, who had trouble with properly testing kits connected to violent crimes.[9]\nRodriguez was soon charged with three counts of murder, and was held in prison without bond. Early, prosecutors announced that they would not seek the death penalty, citing the accused's history of mental illness and the fact that he waived his right to a jury trial.[12] At his subsequent trial, Rodriguez's attorney attempted to bar the prosecution from presenting his client's graphic written confessions from being used in court, in addition to questioning the legitimacy of how they were obtained in the first place.[13]\nIn the end, Rodriguez was found guilty on all counts and handed three consecutive life terms. One of the prosecutors, Assistant District Attorney Carlos Vega, later noted that his actions were simply \"evil\", citing the fact the sexual abuse Rodriguez inflicted post-mortem and him posing his victims' bodies.[1] After his sentencing, Rodriguez was transferred to serve his sentence at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Rockview, where he remains to this day.\n",

        "paragraph": "On August 28, 2003, pizza delivery man Brian Douglas Wells robbed a PNC Bank near his hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania. After being apprehended by police, Wells was murdered when an explosive collar locked to his neck detonated. A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into the murder uncovered a complex plot described as \"one of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the FBI\".[1]\nIn conjunction with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), the FBI investigation led to Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes being charged with the crime in 2007. The investigation determined the plot was masterminded by Diehl-Armstrong to receive an inheritance by hiring Barnes with the money from the bank robbery to kill her father. William Rothstein and Floyd Stockton were also found to have conspired in the crime, but Rothstein died before being charged and Stockton was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against Diehl-Armstrong. Diehl-Armstrong was sentenced in 2011 to life in prison, without the possibility of parole, and Barnes received a reduced sentence of 22.5 years in exchange for testifying against Diehl-Armstrong; both died in prison.\nWells' involvement in the plot is a matter of controversy. Investigators concluded Wells was a willing participant in the bank robbery, but was told the bomb was fake. Wells' family said he was forced to rob the bank by the conspirators. Known as the \"collar bomb\" and \"pizza bomber\" case, the incident gained extensive media coverage, including the 2018 Netflix series Evil Genius.\nBrian Wells was born in Warren, Pennsylvania, to Rose and Harold Wells, the latter of whom was a Korean War veteran. In 1973, when Wells was a 16-year-old sophomore, he dropped out of Erie's East High School and went to work as a mechanic.[2]\nAt Kenneth Barnes' home, he, Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, and William Rothstein discussed ways they could make money. Diehl-Armstrong suggested Barnes kill her father, Harold Diehl, so she would receive an inheritance. Barnes told her he was willing to do this for US$250,000 (equivalent to $368,262 in 2021).[3]  The collar bomb-bank robbery plot was hatched to obtain enough money to pay Barnes to kill Diehl-Armstrong's father.[a] In return for a reduced sentence, Barnes later told investigators Diehl-Armstrong was the mastermind of the crime and that she wanted the money to pay Barnes to kill her father, who she believed was wasting her inheritance.[5]\nDiehl-Armstrong, Barnes, and Rothstein seem to have had issues with compulsive hoarding.[6][7]\nMarjorie Eleanor \"Marge\" Diehl-Armstrong (February 26, 1949 \u2013 April 4, 2017) had a history of suffering from multiple mental illnesses including bipolar disorder,[6][7] since her early teens,  and seems to have been a serial killer.[8] Before her mental health deteriorated in her twenties, Diehl-Armstrong was an \"exemplary student\" in high school and earned a master's degree from Gannon College.[6][9] In 1984, she shot her boyfriend Robert Thomas six times as he lay on the couch but was acquitted on claims of self-defense.[6][10]  Her husband and several other partners also died under suspicious circumstances.[11] Diehl-Armstrong died from breast cancer in prison on April 4, 2017, at the age of 68.[12][6]\nKenneth Barnes (1954 \u2013 June 20, 2019) was a retired television repairman, crack dealer, and Diehl-Armstrong's \"fishing buddy\". He suffered from diabetes and died in prison on June 20, 2019, at the age of 64\u201365.[13]\nWilliam Ansel \"Bill\" Rothstein (January 17, 1944  \u2013 July 30, 2004) dated Diehl-Armstrong in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was implicated in a 1977 murder after he gave a handgun to a friend who used it to murder a romantic rival; he later attempted to destroy the weapon but was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony.[14] Rothstein was a handyman and part-time shop teacher, and was part of a group called the \"fractured intellectuals\"; intelligent people who were not well-adjusted.[15] Rothstein was admitted to the Millcreek Community Hospital on July 23, 2004, having previously been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showing diffuse, large-cell type myeloproliferative lymphoma, and died on July 30 that year at the age of 60.[16][5] Rothstein was the putative creator of the collar bomb.\n",

        "paragraph": "Daniel Burros (March 5, 1937 \u2013 October 31, 1965) was a Jewish American who was a former member of the American Nazi Party. Later, after a falling-out with founder George Lincoln Rockwell, Burros became a Kleagle, or recruiter, for the New York State branch of the United Klans of America, the most violent Klan group of the time.[1]\nBurros killed himself on October 31, 1965, hours after his Jewish heritage was made public, shooting himself in the chest and then the head. At the time, he was reportedly listening to music composed by Richard Wagner.[2]\nDaniel Burros was born to Jewish parents George and Esther Sunshine Burros in the Bronx.  The family moved to Queens a few years later and Burros attended Hebrew school at Talmud Torah in Richmond Hill, where his bar mitzvah was held in 1950.[3]\nBurros expressed a desire to enter the United States Military Academy at West Point (which never came to fruition). However, he enlisted in the National Guard while still in high school and wore his uniform to class on drill days. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1955, but he was later discharged after a series of suicide attempts involving the ingestion of large amounts of aspirin and non-fatal cuts on his wrists. He praised Adolf Hitler in a suicide note. His discharge was ascribed to \"reasons of unsuitability, character, and behavior disorder\".[4]\nBurros eventually joined the American Nazi Party. He was an editor of the party's newsletter, Stormtrooper.[5] Burros's Jewish heritage had been suspected by a number of fellow American Nazi Party members. Many of Rockwell's stormtroopers distrusted Burros not only for being Jewish, but also a self-hating Jew, and for his bizarre behavior. Burros would sometimes bring a knish to the American Nazi Party headquarters and make such statements as \"Let's eat this good Jew food!\" Burros also frequently spent time with Jewish women. In one incident, described in William H. Schmaltz' 1999 book, Hate: George Lincoln Rockwell and the American Nazi Party, Burros once publicly described a lurid fantasy in which the keys of a piano were modified to deliver electric shocks via wires attached to the Jewish victim of their choice. He believed that the combination of music from the piano and the electric shocks would cause them to convulse in rhythm to the piano and provide entertainment. Another example is the fact that he owned a bar of soap wrapped in paper with the words \"made from the finest Jewish fat\" imprinted on it.[4] According to the writer Martin Lee, \"a former Nazi associate claimed that Burros enjoyed torturing dogs, including his own pet, Gas Chambers\".[5]\nBurros's Jewish background was made public in a New York Times article written by reporter John McCandlish Phillips.[6] Phillips initially tried to reach out to Burros by bringing up statements which indicated that he felt trapped in the racist movement. However, his attempts were unsuccessful. Not long after the Times issue with the startling revelations of his Jewish heritage went on sale, Burros died by suicide in the residence of his friend and fellow Klansman Roy Frankhouser in Reading, Pennsylvania.[7]\nIn a press conference, a morose George Lincoln Rockwell praised Burros's dedication. He took the opportunity to rail against Jews, whom he referred to as \"a unique people with a distinct mass of mental disorders\" and ascribed Burros's instability and suicide to \"this unfortunate Jewish psychosis\".[8] Despite the fact that Burros was a Jew and distrusted by his stormtroopers, Rockwell had wished to maintain at least a working relationship with him.\nBurros is sometimes cited as an example of a self-hating Jew. He was also influenced by Francis Parker Yockey's Imperium.[9]\nThe story of Dan Burros was also loosely adapted into Henry Bean's 2001 film The Believer. It also inspired the fifth episode of the first season of the TV series Lou Grant, titled \"Nazi\", which aired on October 18, 1977,[10] and the season 5 episode of Cold Case titled \"Spiders\".\n",

During World War II, nylon was used extensively for parachutes and other war materials, such as airplane cords and ropes and the supply of nylon consumer goods was curtailed.\nThe riots occurred between August 1945 and March 1946, when the War Production Board announced that the creation of Du Pont's nylon would shift its manufacturing from wartime material to nylon stockings, at the same time launching a promotional campaign. In one of the worst disturbances, in Pittsburgh, 40,000 women queued up for 13,000 pairs of stockings, leading to fights breaking out.[1][2] It took several months before Du Pont was able to ramp up production to meet demand, but until they did many women went without nylon stockings for months.\nDuring World War II, Japan stopped using supplies made out of silk, and so the United States had difficulty importing silk from Japan. Eventually, the U.S was unable to import any silk. So, Du Pont thought of an idea to convince the army that nylon is a much more effective material than silk. Du Pont was able to convince the army, and nylon fabric became increasingly popular because of its elasticity and shrink-proof, moth-proof material.\nNylon stockings became increasingly popular on the black market, and sold for up to $20 per pair. Women who could not get their hands on nylons resorted to lotions, creams, stick cakes and painting seam lines down their legs to give the illusion of nylons. Because nylon stockings were so widely sought-after, they also became the target of crime. In Louisiana, one household was robbed of 18 pairs of nylons. Similarly, robbery was ruled out as the motive of a murder in Chicago because the nylons were untouched.[3]\nGeorge Marion, Jr. and Fats Waller's song \"When the Nylons Bloom Again\" described this situation in poetic terms:[2][4]\nGone are the days when I'd answer the bell\nFind a salesman with stockings to sell\nGleam in his eye and measuring tape in his hand\nI get the urge to go splurging on hose\nNylons a dozen of those\nNow poor or rich we're enduring instead\nWoolens which itch\nRayons that spread\nI'll be happy when the nylons bloom again\nCotton is monotonous to men\nOnly way to keep affection fresh\nGet some mesh for your flesh\nI'll be happy when the nylons bloom again\nAin't no need to blow no sirens then\nWhen the frozen hosen can appear\nMan that means all clear\n",

Albritton later married a woman named Marie and they lived in both Florida and Philadelphia before he began his baseball career.[4]\nAlbritton appeared in at least one game for the Bacharach Giants in 1918, appearing in relief and allowing eight earned runs in 2.1 innings.[5]\nIn 1920, Albritton played with the Pittsburgh Colored Stars of Buffalo before he was acquired by the Washington Braves in April 1921, for whom he played with through at least mid-May.[6][7][8][9][10] By June 1921, he had joined the Hilldale Club.[11]\nAlbritton pitched for the Baltimore Black Sox in 1922 and remained with the club when they joined the Eastern Colored League in 1923.[12][13] By May 1923, he was pitching for the Washington Potomacs,[14] and would remain with the club, now playing in Wilmington, Delaware, through 1925.[15] In between appearances with the Potomacs, Albritton also pitched for the Brooklyn Cuban Giants in 1924.[16][17]\nBy 1925, Albritton had earned the nickname \"war horse\" for his willingness to pitch as much as four times in a week.[18]\nAlbritton was beaten to death at Philadelphia State Hospital at Byberry in 1940. According to the Republican Herald, witnesses testified that Albritton attacked attendant Frank Weinand, who then subdued Albritton, ultimately resulting in his death.[19][20] Weinand was arrested and charged with homicide,[21] but was cleared of any wrongdoing.[4]\nWhile his death certificate lists his burial location as Eden Cemetery in Collingdale, Pennsylvania, cemetery officials could find no record of anyone matching his description buried in 1940 or 1941.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOctavius Valentine Catto (February 22, 1839 \u2013 October 10, 1871) was an American educator, intellectual, and civil rights activist. He became principal of male students at the Institute for Colored Youth, where he had also been educated. Born free in Charleston, South Carolina, in a prominent mixed-race family, he moved north as a boy with his family. After completing his education, he went into teaching, and becoming active in civil rights. He also became known as a top cricket and baseball player in 19th-century Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A Republican, he was shot and killed in election-day violence in Philadelphia, where ethnic Irish of the Democratic Party, which was anti-Reconstruction and had opposed black suffrage, attacked black men to prevent their voting for Republican candidates.\nOctavius Catto was born free, as his mother was free: Sarah Isabella Cain was a member of the city's prominent mixed-race DeReef family, which had been free for decades and belonged to the Brown Fellowship Society as a mark of their status.[1] His father, William T. Catto, had been a slave millwright in South Carolina and gained his freedom. He was ordained as a Presbyterian minister before taking his family north, first to Baltimore, and then to Philadelphia, where they settled in the free state of Pennsylvania. The state had gradually abolished slavery, beginning before the end of the Revolutionary War.[2][3]\nWilliam T. Catto was a founding member of Philadelphia's Banneker Institute, an African-American intellectual and literary society.[4] He wrote \"A Semi-Centenary Discourse,\" a history of the First African Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia.[5]\nCatto began his education at Vaux Primary School and then Lombard Grammar School, institutions specifically for the education of African-American's, in Philadelphia. In 1853, he entered the, otherwise, all-white Allentown Academy in Allentown, New Jersey, located across the Delaware River and 40 miles north. In 1854, when his family returned to Philadelphia, he became a student at that city's Institute for Colored Youth (ICY).[1] Managed by the Society of Friends (Quakers), ICY's curriculum included the classical study of Latin, Greek, geometry, and trigonometry.[6]\nWhile a student at ICY, Catto presented papers and took part in scholarly discussions at \"a young men's instruction society\". Led by fellow ICY student Jacob C. White Jr., they met weekly at the ICY.[1][4] Catto graduated from ICY in 1858, winning praise from principal Ebenezer Bassett for \"outstanding scholarly work, great energy, and perseverance in school matters.\"[1] Catto did a year of post-graduate study, including private tutoring in both Greek and Latin, in Washington, D. C.\nIn 1859, he returned to Philadelphia, where he was elected full member and Recording Secretary of the Banneker Institute. He also was hired as teacher of English and mathematics at the ICY.[1][4][7]\nOn May 10, 1864, Catto delivered ICY's commencement address, which gave a historical synopsis of the school.[6] In addition, Catto's address touched on the issue of the potential lack of sensitivity of white teachers toward the needs and interests of African-American students:\nIt is at least unjust to allow a blind and ignorant prejudice to so far disregard the choice of parents and the will of the colored tax-payers, as to appoint over colored children white teachers, whose intelligence and success, measured by the fruits of their labors, could neither obtain nor secure for them positions which we know would be more congenial to their tastes.[6]",

Daugherty, who was mentally disabled, was tortured and murdered before being wrapped in Christmas decorations, put inside a garbage can, and dumped in the parking lot of Greensburg-Salem Middle School.\nAmber Meidinger met Melvin Knight at a homeless shelter in Washington in January 2010. They moved to several locations before settling in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where they met Jennifer Daugherty.[1] Knight met Ricky Smyrnes after meeting previously in jail.[2]\nMelvin L. Knight (born October 27, 1989)[3] was born to a drug-addicted father who was imprisoned during the early years of his life. He developed lifelong learning and social problems after he fell out of a moving vehicle and hit his head at age 5.[4]\nAngela Lynn Marinucci (born July 14, 1992),[3] according to testimony by her mother and half-sister, Marinucci suffered a head injury when she was hit by a truck in 2008, at the age of 15. The injury substantially altered her behavior and pushed her into a downward spiral that ended with Daugherty\u2019s death, according to the defense. Two mental experts testified that Marinucci as a child, suffered from depression and that she may have had drug and alcohol addictions as a teenager.[5]\nMeidinger told jurors, \"at some point, she [Daugherty] trusted me because she knew me from the West Place (a center for people with special needs).\" Meidinger testified she and her then-boyfriend and co-defendant Melvin Knight met Smyrnes on February 8, 2010, after she and Knight had been staying at a Greensburg-area hotel. Knight and Smyrnes knew each other after meeting in jail, and Meidinger was pregnant with Knight's child when all three met up. Smyrnes offered Meidinger and Knight to stay at his apartment at 428 N. Pennsylvania Avenue in Greensburg.[6]\nRicky Ven Edward Smyrnes (born March 6, 1986)[3] was born to a drug-addicted Philadelphia sex worker and a Pittsburgh gang member. He was moved into and out of foster homes as a child and was treated for mental health disorders as early as age 4. He suffered abuse and neglect until he was taken in by the Smyrnes family in North Huntingdon at age 10, according to testimony by forensic psychologist Alice Applegate.[7] His lawyer, Terri Fayes, told the jury that Smyrnes suffered sexual and physical abuse from his father and his uncle. She also explained how he had tried beer, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana by age 6, had been diagnosed with PTSD at age 8, and had undergone 103 therapy sessions by age 10. She added he was diagnosed as having as many as seven different personalities, and 15 total psychiatric issues. In 1997, he burglarized his neighbor's home and stole knives, guitars, coins, bullets, and cash. That same year, he sexually assaulted a woman in her basement.[8]\nAccording to a testimony by Meidinger, the group went through her purse and stole money, gift cards, and her cell phone. They poured liquids into her bag, hit her head with filled soda bottles, cut her hair, painted her face with nail polish, and dumped liquid and spices on her head. Meidinger said she and Angela Marinucci took turns violently hitting Daugherty with a metal towel rack and crutches. She also noted that Daugherty was stripped naked, gagged, and raped by Knight.[1] They also forced her to consume feces, urine, and detergent.[9][10] Meidinger also said Knight took Daugherty to the living room where Marinucci poured a bottle of water over Daugherty's head and Knight and Smyrnes dumped oatmeal and spices on her head. Daugherty said that her eyes were burning, and Smyrnes told her to take a shower because she smelled bad.[2]\nAccording to her relatives, Daugherty had the mental abilities of an adolescent, trusted everyone, and thought that the suspects were her \"friends.\"[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "\n\nThe 1834 Philadelphia race riot , also known as the Flying Horses riot,[1][2] was an instance of communal violence in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The riot, in which a mob of several hundred white people attacked African Americans living in the area, began on the evening of August 12 and lasted for several days, dying down by August 14.\nThe riot took place during a time when many cities in the northern United States were experiencing incidents of mass civil unrest, usually in the form of riots that targeted specific religious, national, or racial groups, such as an 1831 race riot in Providence, Rhode Island, and the 1834 Ursuline Convent riots near Boston. In Philadelphia, this period coincided with a significant growth in population, particularly among African Americans and Irish immigrants. While there had been a strong community of working-class black freedmen in Philadelphia since the early 1800s, tensions began to build through the 1830s, with restrictions on African Americans participation in civic life and incidents of racial violence, such as in an 1829 incident where members of a black church were attacked. In early August 1834, there were several instances of violence against African Americans in the city, including an attack on the son of well-known black businessman James Forten by a white mob.\nOn August 12, 1834, a mob of several hundred white men, primarily Irish, attacked the Flying Horses tavern, a well-known local on South Street that served both black and white people in the area, named for a popular carousel on site. The mob overpowered the black people there, destroyed the carousel and building, and proceeded down South Street and into Moyamensing, where they proceeded to destroy black-owned buildings and attack black people. Philadelphia Mayor John Swift assembled a posse of several hundred citizens to restore order, and 18 people were arrested, but rioting commenced again the following night, resulting in the destruction of the African Presbyterian Church and the death of an African American man by beating. The next night was the last major night of rioting and saw the destruction of another church, though some minor instances of violence continued for the next few nights. In general, rioters targeted the houses of more wealthy African Americans and social spaces, such as churches and a Masonic Hall. In total, between August 12 and 16, 60 people had been arrested for rioting. In the end, 44 buildings had been destroyed, including 30 houses, and two people were dead.\nA citizen's committee organized to investigate the causes of the riot reported that the primary cause was a sense of anxiety among white citizens who believed that black people were outcompeting them for jobs. This ascertain has been discussed by historians, who also attribute the riot to fears over interracial mixing and resentments held against more affluent African Americans by poor whites. Over the next several years, Philadelphia experienced a wave of race riots, including one the following year and the 1838 destruction of Pennsylvania Hall. Discussing this time period, local author Charles Godfrey Leland wrote, \"Whoever shall write a history of Philadelphia from the Thirties to the era of the Fifties will record a popular period of turbulence and outrages so extensive as to now appear almost incredible\". By 1854, in part due to the riots, the county and city of Philadelphia were consolidated and a new police agency was created.\nDuring the 1830s, many large cities in the northern United States, such as Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia, experienced several major riots, with causes ranging from election disputes, labor issues, and racial tensions.[4] According to historian David Hackett Fischer, the rise in the number of incidents in civil unrest corresponded to a long period of economic decline that the nation's economy was experiencing in the early 1800s, with riots breaking out in major urban areas that pitted different ethnic, religious, and social groups against each other, such as Protestants against Catholics and native-born Americans against immigrants.[1] Starting in the 1820s, race riots, where white Americans targeted African Americans, became common occurrences in many of these cities.[3] These events, which saw white Americans target their city's African American population, were highly violent and destructive, with an 1831 incident in Providence, Rhode Island, resulting in the destruction of an African American neighborhood,[3] while an 1834 riot in New York City saw a church, school, and several dozen houses destroyed.[5] Symbols of upward economic mobility among the African American community, such as church buildings and temperance halls, were often targeted as a way of maintaining a racial hierarchy of white supremacy.[6] While race riots were common in many cities, Cincinnati and Philadelphia experienced the most,[7] experiencing at least one per year between the two between 1834 and 1836 and again from 1838 to 1842.[5]\nBy the early 1800s, slavery in Philadelphia had been largely eliminated, with only 10 black people in the city recorded as slaves in the 1810 United States census.[1] Additionally, the city had a large community of black freedmen and was a strong center for the abolitionist movement,[8] with historian Manisha Sinha calling the city \"the antislavery capital of the country\".[9] From the late 1700s to the early 1800s, buoyed by a strong economy, the city's African American community saw economic growth, improved living conditions and access to jobs and education, and strong civic engagement with the rest of the city.[1] However, by the early 1800s, this trend began to reverse.[1] In 1804, a group of young black men marched through the Philadelphia neighborhood of Southwark, threatening many of the white residents there and openly calling for rebellion.[10][1] The following year, during Independence Day celebrations at Independence Hall, a mob of white people chased out black participants, putting an end to the annual integrated celebrations that had been ongoing since 1776.[1] By the late 1820s, black people were also banned from the city's Christmas celebrations.[10] In 1829,[10] a riot broke out wherein members of a black church were attacked.[1] That same year, the Pennsylvania General Assembly openly advocated for the American Colonization Society's goal of relocating freed black people in the United States to Africa, and following Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831, the legislature banned freedmen from entering the state and repealed fugitive slave legislation that protected escaped slaves from being sold back into slavery in the southern United States.[11]\nDespite these changes, the African American population in the area continued to grow alongside the overall population,[12] From 1820 to 1830, the number of black people living around Philadelphia grew to about 15,000, making it the largest African American community in the northern United States.[13] Working class municipalities around Philadelphia's Center City, such as Southwark, Moyamensing, Northern Liberties, and Spring Garden, grew as homes to both African Americans and white people, primarily composed of Irish immigrants.[14] By the 1830s, there were 29 separate jurisdictions in Philadelphia County, which were patrolled by constables who had a difficult time keeping the peace amidst the growth.[1] In many of these places, black and white people both frequented the same shops and social places, such as taverns, which led to some incidents of violence.[14] In some cases, white residents rented their places of lodging from black landowners, which led to further resentment among the poor whites.[14] Highlighting the resentment against African Americans during this time, historian Barbara Lewis notes that in June 1834, just two months prior to the outbreak of the race riot, performer George Washington Dixon had debuted a minstrel show featuring blackface actors playing Zip Coon at the Arch Street Theatre to much fanfare.[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "Jason Keel Sweeney (July 29, 1986 \u2013 May 30, 2003) was a construction worker from Fishtown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who at the age of 16 was murdered by four teenagers for his paycheck on May 30, 2003. The perpetrators included a girl he was dating and his best friend since childhood. Due to the manner in which Sweeney was murdered, the ages of the teens involved, and the seeming indifference of the perpetrators, the crime received national media coverage.[2]\nJason Sweeney left school and was working for his father, a contractor, on a building project in Philadelphia. He recently met a girl he liked, 15-year-old Justina Morley, with whom he had a date on the evening of Friday, May 30, 2003. Unbeknownst to Sweeney, Morley engaged in sexual relations with two other 16-year-olds, Nicholas Coia and Edward Batzig Jr.[3] Batzig was Sweeney's best friend since the fourth grade. Nicholas Coia and his 17-year-old brother, Domenic Coia, were also friends with Sweeney, but the brothers later ended the friendship.[4]\nWith the promise of sex, Morley lured Sweeney to \"The Trails,\" a wooded area of Fishtown near the Delaware River, where Batzig and the Coia brothers were lying in wait. Batzig took the first blow, striking Sweeney in the head four or five times.[5]  Batzig and the Coia brothers then pummeled Sweeney, primarily on his head and face, with a hatchet, a hammer and a rock until he was dead. Batzig later told a detective how he hit Sweeney with the hatchet face four or five times. Batzig said, \"Jason started begging for his life, but we just kept hitting him.\"[6] Batzig also said that Sweeney looked at him during the beating and said, \u201cPlease stop, I'm bleeding,\" after which Batzig hit Sweeney again with the axe.[citation needed] They finished by dropping a boulder on the right side of his head.[7] Sweeney's head was crushed and the only bone left undamaged was his left cheekbone.[8] He was identified by a cut on his hand that he sustained at his construction job.[citation needed]\nFollowing Sweeney's murder, the four assailants stole the $500 cash he earned from work.[7] Before leaving the crime scene, the Coias, Batzig and Morley shared a group hug and split the money, which they used to buy jewelry and illegal drugs\u2014heroin, marijuana, and Xanax\u2014and then \"partied beyond redemption,\" according to Domenic.[6][9]\nDomenic Coia confessed in a court hearing that they were all involved in the murder of Sweeney. The police said the murder was planned days before. Part of the preparation of the murder was listening to the Beatles song \"Helter Skelter\" over forty times, prompting later news coverage to draw a parallel to the Manson family murders.[2][6] Joshua Staab, 18, a friend of Domenic Coia, said that the group bragged about their plan to kill Sweeney by using Justina Morley as \"bait.\" Staab also said that Batzig knew that Sweeney would have his paycheck earnings on him on the day of the murder. The prosecutor asked Staab about the teens' demeanor after the killing. Staab said, \"They seemed pretty fine. In a way, happy.\"[6]\nAlthough all four teens involved in the murder were drug addicts, they were not high before they murdered Sweeney. In response to a detective's question about whether they were high during the killing, Domenic Coia answered, \"No, I was as sober as I am now. It is sick, isn't it?\"[6] A detective involved in the case and a forensic psychologist later opined that the killers' motivation went beyond robbery and stemmed from envy and resentment of Sweeney's relative success in life.[10]\nIn his memoir, Domenic Coia gave a different account of the murder. Domenic claimed he panicked when Batzig actually hit Sweeney and only participated when he feared him and his brother getting caught. He also denies stating he was sober during the attack and states he later prevented them from killing Justina Morley as they feared she would testify. He also denies involvement in any plans for the murder before the day it happened.\nJustina Morley claimed that she started smoking marijuana at the age of 10, and shortly thereafter started taking prescription pills and snorting cocaine. April Frederick, Morley's mother, said her daughter started cutting her wrists at the age of 10. Morley was hospitalized for threatening suicide and self-mutilation in 2002. She was once admitted to Friends Hospital for cutting her wrists, knees and thighs, taking pills and displaying a suicide poem, which she penned on her door. Morley told her mother that she would commit suicide if her mother did not take her out of the hospital; her mother then took her out against the hospital's advice. Morley was expelled from public school in the eighth grade, which she then repeated at the private Holy Name of Jesus Catholic school in Fishtown.\nA psychiatrist hired by the defense team, William Russell, said the reason Morley began sexual activity at an early age \"was an attempt at validation of self-worth\". Morley testified that she had sex with both Nicholas Coia and Batzig in exchange for heroin just a few days before they murdered Sweeney.\nMorley was released on Dec. 20, 2020.\n[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "On March 1, 2000, a shooting spree took place in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, when 39-year-old Ronald Taylor opened fire on five people within an eight block radius.[2] Three of the five people he shot died while the other two survived. Taylor surrendered to police later that day and was sentenced to death in 2002. The shooting spree was racially motivated, as Taylor, an African American, was known to have been prejudice towards white people; all the victims killed in the shooting were white.[3]\nAt about 9 a.m. on March 1, 2000, two maintenance workers, John Dewitt and 55-year-old John Kroll, arrived at the apartment of 39-year-old Ronald Taylor to replace Taylor's door.[4] When Taylor answered the door, he began taunting both with insults about them being white, according to Dewitt, who claimed Taylor said \"You white, racist, pig\".[5] Nevertheless, the two began work. At around 10:30 a.m., after removing the old door, Dewitt and Kroll started installing the new door, while Taylor continued harassing them. Eventually, Dewitt told Taylor, \"Why don't you just shut up.\" Taylor responded to Dewitt, \"You're dead.\"[5] As the job was almost done, a woman downstairs from Taylor called upstairs and asked if one of the maintenance workers could come and help her with a locked bedroom door. Dewitt said he could and walked downstairs, while Kroll finished the job. Kroll then went downstairs to meet a coworker named Andrew Williams.\nAt just about 11:15 a.m, Taylor grabbed his .22 caliber revolver and set his apartment couch on fire.[5] Armed with the gun, he confronted Kroll and Williams downstairs and reportedly told them \"I don't like white people\", then proceeded to shoot Kroll in the neck.[5] Williams rushed to Kroll's side while Taylor decided not to shoot Williams, likely because Williams was black, but instead demanded to know where Dewitt was. Dewitt, who was in the parking lot putting tools away, walked back into the building to get Kroll when he noticed Taylor with a gun, so he took cover.[5] Minutes later, he saw Williams covered in blood walking with Kroll in his arms, and as Taylor was not in sight, he rushed over to Williams and asked what was going on.\nWilliams told Dewitt that Taylor shot Kroll and was looking for him.[5] The two then put Kroll in the back of the employee pickup truck and drove to the Western Pennsylvania Hospital. Police and firefighters were contacted and rushed to Taylor's apartment, but by that time, Taylor had fled.[5] About five minutes later Taylor walked two blocks  to Burger King at Penn and Pitt avenues, where he fatally shot 71-year-old former priest Joseph Healy.[4] Shortly afterwards, Taylor approached a McDonald's, and shot multiple times at the van belonging to 56-year-old Richard Clinger.[5] Some shots hit Clinger, and his stepdaughter Cindy Zambo ran to a nearby Dunkin' Donuts where she alerted people there about her dad being shot. Meanwhile, Taylor entered the McDonald's and shot the manager, 25-year-old Steven Bostard.[5] Taylor then returned to the parking lot and shot 20-year-old Emil Sanielevici, who was waiting to pick up food. Sanielevici later died, while Clinger and Bostard survived after being treated at the UPMC.[6] At 11:51 a.m., Kroll, who was awaiting surgery, died from his bullet wound.[5]\nAt around 12:00 p.m., police cornered Taylor at a residential building, where Taylor took refuge in an empty room.[5] Sgt. John Fisher began communicating with Taylor and begged him to surrender. Taylor told the officer that he was going to commit suicide because he did not want his mother to see him in jail.[7] After two hours, Fisher was able to convince Taylor to surrender, and at around 2:15 p.m., Taylor handed over his gun and was arrested.[5]\n[6]\nRonald Taylor (born September 30, 1960),[8] the shooter, had no prior criminal record.[9] Taylor grew up in the predominantly African-American Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[10] When he was young, he was diagnosed with asthma.[10] He attended Fifth Avenue High School until it closed in 1976; afterwards he attended Letsche Education Center.[11] At the time of the shooting spree, Taylor lived in the Woodside Garden Apartments and was unemployed,[12] living on Supplemental Security Income and food stamp benefits which totaled between $600 and $700 a month.[10]\nIn a search of Taylor's apartment police found writings that signified Taylor's anti-white beliefs.[13] There were also anti-semitic writings with excerpts such as \"big thumbs up to Hitler\".[14] Taylor had written a suicide note which investigators found after the shooting. The note read as follows;\nFriends of Taylor reported that they were \"stunned\" to hear that Taylor had committed the shootings. David Ellis, an acquaintance of Taylor, said that Taylor \"never caused any trouble I knew of\". They also reported to be \"shocked\" about the accusations of Taylor being racist.[10] Neighbors of Taylor described him as \"quiet\" and someone who \"didn't start any trouble\".[16] Taylor rarely met with his family members and spent a large amount of time in isolation.[17] Taylor did have a history of mental illness and one professional, Dr. Horacio Fabrega, who would testify for Taylor's defense, described Taylor as \"delusional\".[18] Fabrega also said that Taylor had once burned an image of Jesus Christ under the belief that God \"turned bad\".[19] Taylor had stolen the revolver he used in the shootings from his mother, who had purchased it in 1982.[20]\n",

Haznawi or Ahmed al-Nami are believed to be one of the apparent hijackers to have carried the bomb.\nHe left his family to fight in Chechnya in 2000 but was probably sent to training camps in Afghanistan. It was there he was chosen to participate in the 9/11 attacks. He arrived in the United States in June 2001 under the direction of Al-Qaeda for terrorist attacks, on a tourist visa. Once he was in the U.S., he settled in Florida and helped plan out how the attacks would take place.\nOn September 11, 2001, al-Haznawi boarded United Airlines Flight 93 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane so it could be crashed into either the United States Capitol or the White House. Instead, the plane crashed into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after the passengers on-board started a revolt against al-Haznawi and the other hijackers.\nAhmed al-Haznawi was the son of a Saudi imam from the Al-Bahah province, a province in the south west of Saudi Arabia. Al-Haznawi grew up in the village of Hazna, where his father was a cleric at the mosque in the central marketplace section of the village. Al-Haznawi belonged to a family that was part of the larger Ghamd tribe, sharing the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Ghamdi.[1] He memorised the Quran, giving him the title Hafiz.[2]\nThis group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers, and they are thought to have met one another some time in 1999.\nAl-Haznawi announced he was leaving his family in 1999 to fight in Chechnya, although his father forbade him.[3] His father and brother, Abdul Rahman al-Haznawi, reportedly last heard from him in late 2000, after he made references to training in Afghanistan.\nOn November 12, 2000, al-Haznawi applied for and received a two-year U.S. B-1/B-2\n(tourist/business) visa in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.[4]\nFrom November 27, 2000, through December 27, 2000, al-Haznawi was in Saudi Arabia for Ramadan.  It is theorized that during this trip, he may have initially told Saeed and Hamza al-Ghamdi about the operation.\nSome time late in 2000, al-Haznawi traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's cheques presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa al-Hawsawi.  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Wail al-Shehri and Ahmed al-Nami.\n",

        "paragraph": "The Muncy Abolition riot of 1842 occurred in April 1842 in Muncy, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania in the United States. The riot started as an attack on a schoolhouse where an abolitionist speaker, invited by local Quakers, spoke against slavery.\nThe speaker and his host, Enos Hawley, were then attacked as they fled to Hawley's house. Eighteen men were initially arrested and charged for the riot. Thirteen men were convicted for their actions in the riot, but were ultimately pardoned by Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter.\nThe process of banning slavery in Pennsylvania began in 1780, when the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a law to slowly abolish it. The new law stated that all people who were slaves in 1780 were to remain slaves until they were freed by their owners and that all children of slaves would remain as slaves until they reached the age of 28. This slow abolition of slavery lasted until 1847 (67 years) when it was fully abolished.\nThe census of 1790 showed that slaves made up one percent of the population of Pennsylvania (for comparison, in New York and New Jersey slaves made up to six percent of the population in the same census). Two cultural influences in Pennsylvania helped keep the numbers of slaves down.[1] The Quaker founders of Pennsylvania were, as a rule, anti-slavery. Their Testimony of Equality held that all people are created equal in the eyes of God.\nThey believed that since all people embodied the same divine spark, all people deserved equal treatment. Quakers were some of the first to value women as important ministers and to campaign for women's rights. They became leaders in the anti-slavery movement, and were among the first to pioneer humane treatment for the mentally ill and for prisoners. Another group of settlers in early Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Dutch, were self-reliant in their beliefs. They avoided the \"outside world\" as much as possible and had no need for slaves.\nThis does not mean that all Pennsylvanians of that time were against slavery. Many of the immigrants that followed the Quakers and the various sects of Pennsylvania Dutch were pro-slavery, or at least definitely not abolitionists. They saw freed slaves as competitors for their jobs.[1] One of the common misconceptions about United States history prior to the Civil War is that all the citizens of the northern states were against slavery.[2] In fact many of the \"Yankees\" were for slavery, especially in states closer to what became the Confederacy, such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Delaware.\nThere were more than a few abolitionists in Pennsylvania and Enos Hawley, a Quaker citizen of Muncy, was one of the most prominent abolitionists in Lycoming County. Hawley, a tanner by trade, was, like most Quakers, a strong supporter of the abolition of slavery.[2] Hawley invited a speaker (whose name is now unknown) to come to Muncy to speak against slavery. This speaker and his speech set off a tremendous riot that lead to the near destruction of a local schoolhouse and the controversial pardoning of the rioters by Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter.\nThe abolitionist speaker gave his speech at a one-room school in Muncy in April 1842. During the course of the speech eighteen men gathered outside the schoolhouse. They began throwing rocks and other debris at the school, breaking all of the windows.[2]\nEnos Hawley and the guest speaker were both injured in the assault. Upon fleeing the school, the abolitionists were pelted with eggs. The rioters followed Hawley and his guest to Hawley's home at the corner of High and Main Streets in Muncy. They continued the assault on Hawley's home until after midnight, when the local law enforcement officers were able to quell the riot and arrest the rioters.[1]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nHarrison Frank \"Marty\" Graham (born September 9, 1959) is an American serial killer who murdered seven women in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania between mid-1986 to mid-1987, keeping their remains in his apartment. In 1988, he was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to death, but his sentences were later commuted to life imprisonment. Graham lived less than a mile and a half away from the home of another murderer, Gary M. Heidnik, who was also arrested during the same time period for similar crimes.[1][2]\nHarrison Graham was born on September 9, 1959 in Philadelphia, the eldest child in a family of five children. Early on in childhood, he exhibited signs of an intellectual disability, due to which he had problems with academic performance and discipline at school. Graham attended the Olney High School, from where he was forced to drop out after the 10th grade due to his failing grades and chronic absences.[3] His mother would later claim that in 1971, Harrison was diagnosed with a mental disorder, thanks to which he had to spend two years in a children's mental facility, but this hasn't been verified. In the early 1970s, Graham entered the workforce, and over the following years mastered many professions in the construction industry, for which he received  good reputation. In 1979, he left his parents' house and moved to North Philadelphia, finding housing in a neighborhood rife with poverty and crime. During this period, he began to drink alcohol, use drugs and spend time among pimps and prostitutes. A tall and athletic man, he wasn't considered violent towards others and was never prosecuted for any crime. In 1983, Harrison rented an apartment in a housing complex with mostly vacant spaces. A number of residents, including Graham himself, in order to fence off a small section of the parking lot near the building, built small walls with two small windows, through which they bought drugs. In the following four years, Graham turned his apartment into a drug den, where friends and acquaintances would often visit to buy and use drugs, consisting mainly of Ritalin and similar substances. Nevertheless, Graham never engaged in violent acts, regularly paid his rent and played basketball with the local youth, living off his disability pension, and was described as a nice man by friends and neighbors alike.[4][5]\nDuring the summer of 1987, Graham's neighbors complained to the landlord about a foul odor coming from Harrison's apartment. After several remarks, which he ignored, on August 9 the landlord demanded that Graham vacate the premises. Harrison refused to let anyone in, boarding up the front door with boards, before collecting his personal items and fleeing via the fire escape. After the landlord was unable to enter the apartment, he called the police. The police officers broke down the door, only to find the naked corpse of a black woman and the partially dressed corpse of another, traces of blood, drugs, as well as a layer of garbage 40 centimeters high, a pile of dirty mattresses and a skeleton. In the closet, more skeletonized remains, wrapped up in a blanket, were found. While inspecting the roof, the investigators found a green duffel bag, which contained the bones of the hands, feet and legs of another murder victim, while an excavation of the basement revealed a skull, ribcage and pelvic bone belonging to a 7th victim. Since all but two of the bodies were in a state of severe decomposition, the police found it difficult to determine their cause of death. The cause for the other two was determined to be strangulation.[4] Graham was put on a wanted list, and during the following week he was reportedly seen on public transport, fast food restaurants, homeless shelters and a car wash, but avoided arrest each time. On August 17, Harrison tracked down his mother, who, after much persuasion, convinced him to surrender, after which she called the police. Graham was arrested on the same day, at a distance of 10 blocks from the apartment. He was taken to the police station, where he readily confessed to all of the killings.[5][6]\nIn his subsequent confession, he explained that he had strangled the seven women after sharing drugs with them during sex. According to his testimony, he committed the first murder at the end of 1986, and killed one of the victims solely because she had discovered one of the bodies. A forensic exam partially confirmed his testimony, concluding that the two recent victims had been strangled 10 days prior to discovery, while the other five had been dead from between six and twelve months ago.[7] The victims were subsequently identified as 27-year-old Cynthia Brooks, 25-year-old Valerie Jamison, 36-year-old Mary Jeter Mathis, 22-year-old Barbara Mahoney, 29-year-old Robin DeShazor, 33-year-old Sandra Garvin and 24-year-old Patricia Franklin.[8][9] During the investigation, it was established that DeShazor had been Graham's longtime girlfriend. Harrison's mother told the police that back in 1981, after an argument with her son, she visited his apartment, where Robin was living, and had seen them use drugs together. An acquaintance of Graham also claimed that in 1984, he had seen him beat Robin.[3]\nHarrison Graham's trial began on March 7, 1988. Early on, he refused a jury trial during the preliminary court hearings, as he fully admitted his guilt. The prosecutor's office demanded the death penalty, while his lawyer, Joel Moldowski, demanded that his client be given a lenient sentence. According to Moldowski, due to his intellectual disability and psychophysical development, Graham was incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, and this, coupled with heavy drug abuse, made him act on impulse and without any self-control. While the proceedings were going on, Harrison appeared to be completely calm. On April 28, 1988, Graham was found guilty on all charges, receiving six death sentences and one life imprisonment term for the murders. As leniency, the court ruled that Graham's death sentences would only be carried out after he has served out his life sentence, thus meaning that he will never be executed. After the trial, Graham asked his lawyer to give him back his Cookie Monster doll, which was seized from him after his arrest.[10] Graham had been attached to the doll for years, it being one of the few items he took with him after escaping his apartment.[11][12][13]\n",

He also recruited a former Army friend, James Mintkenbaugh. Johnson worked for the KGB between 1953 and 1964, and passed on information while stationed at various sites in Europe and the U.S.\nMost famously, when working in the U.S. courier center at Orly Airport south of Paris, he occasionally had night duty alone in the center, where dispatches arrived to and from Air Force and Army bases in Europe. He used to come out of the center and hand KGB contacts envelopes full of documents to photocopy. They had a car waiting in which they sped to the Soviet embassy, photographed the documents, replaced them, and resealed the envelopes so there was no trace that they had been opened. Then they rushed them back to Orly to get them to Johnson before he went off duty in the morning.[1]\nIn 1964, Johnson was turned in by his wife and, like Mintkenbaugh, received a 25-year prison sentence in 1965.[2]\nJohnson, who was imprisoned at Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, was stabbed to death there by his son in 1972: \"Johnson, having not seen his son for many years, reached out to shake his hand in the prison reception area when, without saying a word, Robert stabbed his father in the chest. ...

Morris died on December 24, 2002, at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital,[1] when she was removed from life support. The Philadelphia Police Department's handling of Morris' death sparked protests in the LGBT community[2] and led to several investigations into the police coverup of her death.[3]\nNizah Morris began living as a woman in her early 20s. By December 2002 she had built a life for herself working at her mother's daycare center, performing in the weekly drag show at Bob and Barbara's\u2014a bar in Philadelphia's Center City neighborhood\u2014and practicing Buddhism.\nOn December 22, Morris attended a party at the Key West Bar at the intersection of Juniper and Chancellor streets in Philadelphia. Morris left the bar at 2:00\u00a0a.m., and collapsed outside of the bar due to intoxication. Onlookers formed a group around Morris\u2014who could not stand without assistance and had to be supported, according to witnesses\u2014and waited for paramedics for approximately 20 minutes.\nA 6th District police officer arrived, canceled the prior call for paramedics when Morris declined to go to a hospital, and offered her a courtesy ride to a hospital. Morris declined a ride to the hospital and asked to be taken home. Witnesses at the scene reportedly helped her into the police cruiser.\nThough Morris lived in the 5000 block of Walnut Street, police officers reported that she asked to be let out at 15th and Walnut streets, left the patrol car, and began walking toward 16th Street.\nMinutes later, a passing motorist discovered Morris lying on the sidewalk, bleeding from the right side of her forehead. A call was placed to 911, and a 9th District officer arrived at the scene, but did not call a supervisor or treat the event as a crime.\nMorris was transported to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in critical condition. On December 23, 2002, she was removed from life support, and at 8:30\u00a0p.m. on December 24, 2002, Nizah Morris was pronounced dead.[4]\nOn December 25, 2002, the Medical Examiner's office classified Morris' death as a homicide.

The plane eventually crashed in Somerset County, Pennsylvania following an attempt by the passengers and crew to regain control of the plane from the hijackers. All 44 people on board were killed, including the hijackers. The aircraft, a Boeing 757-222, was flying United Airlines' daily scheduled morning flight from Newark International Airport in New Jersey to San Francisco International Airport in California.\nThe hijackers stormed the aircraft's cockpit 46 minutes after takeoff. The captain and first officer struggled with the hijackers, which was transmitted to air traffic control. Ziad Jarrah, who had trained as a pilot, took control of the aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, considered principal instigators of the attacks, have claimed that the intended target was the U.S. Capitol Building.[1]\nSeveral passengers and flight attendants learned from phone calls that suicide attacks had already been made by hijacked airliners on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. Rather than cede control of the plane, many of the passengers attempted to retake it from the hijackers. During the struggle, the plane crashed into a field near a reclaimed strip mine in Stonycreek Township, near Indian Lake and Shanksville, about 65 miles (105\u00a0km) southeast of Pittsburgh and 130 miles (210\u00a0km) northwest of Washington, D.C. A few people witnessed the impact from the ground, and news agencies began reporting the event within an hour.\nOf the four aircraft hijacked on September 11\u00a0\u2013 the others were American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, and American Airlines Flight 77\u00a0\u2013 United Airlines Flight\u00a093 was the only aircraft that did not reach its hijackers' intended target. A temporary memorial was built near the crash site soon after the attacks.[2] Construction of a permanent Flight 93 National Memorial was dedicated on September 10, 2011,[3] and a concrete and glass visitor center (situated on a hill overlooking the site)[4] was opened exactly four years later.[5]\nThe hijacking of Flight\u00a093 was led by Ziad Jarrah, a member of al-Qaeda.[6] Jarrah was born in Lebanon to a wealthy family and had a secular upbringing.[7] He intended to become a pilot and moved to Germany in 1996, enrolling at the University of Greifswald to study German.[8] A year later, he moved to Hamburg and began studying aeronautical engineering at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences.[9] In Hamburg, Jarrah became a devout Muslim and associated with the radical Hamburg cell.[9][10]\nIn November 1999, Jarrah left Hamburg for Afghanistan, where he spent three months.[11] While there, he met with al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in January 2000.[12] Jarrah returned to Hamburg at the end of January and in February obtained a new passport containing no stamped records of his travels by reporting his passport as stolen.[13][11]\nIn May, Jarrah received a visa from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin,[14] arriving in Florida in June 2000. There, he began taking flying lessons and training in hand-to-hand combat.[15][16] Jarrah maintained contact with his girlfriend in Germany and with his family in Lebanon in the months preceding the attacks.[17] This close contact upset Mohamed Atta, the tactical leader of the plot, and al-Qaeda planners may have considered another operative, Zacarias Moussaoui, to replace him if he had backed out.[18]\nFour \"muscle\" hijackers were trained to storm the cockpit and overpower the crew, and three accompanied Jarrah on Flight\u00a093. The first, Ahmed al-Nami, arrived in Miami, Florida, on May 28, 2001, on a six-month tourist visa with United Airlines Flight\u00a0175 hijackers Hamza al-Ghamdi and Mohand al-Shehri. The second, Ahmed al-Haznawi, arrived in Miami on June\u00a08 with Flight\u00a011 hijacker Wail al-Shehri. The third, Saeed al-Ghamdi, arrived in Orlando, Florida, on June 27 with Flight\u00a0175 hijacker Fayez Banihammad.[15] Ziad Jarrah's and Saeed al-Ghamdi's passports were recovered from the Flight 93 crash site.[19] Jarrah's family said he had been an \"innocent passenger\" on board the flight.[20]\n",

Glick also played rugby at the University of Rochester where he was a team Captain.[8]\nGlick was a resident of West Milford, New Jersey.[9]\nAccording to accounts of cell phone conversations, Glick, along with Todd Beamer, Mark Bingham and Tom Burnett, formed a plan to take the plane back from the hijackers, and led other passengers in this effort.[10] Glick's last words to his wife when aboard Flight 93 were: \"We're going to rush the hijackers.\" He then hung up the phone.[11][12]\nCo-workers and family stated that they were not surprised that Glick took action. Glick's brother-in-law Douglas Hurwitt said, \"that was my brother-in-law. He was a take-charge guy.\"[11] Glick's former boss, Thomas Torf, added: \"He was a no-nonsense kind of guy. He took ownership of things. Very focused. He loved his family. He was a good businessman. All of us loved him.\"[13]\nGlick is memorialized at the Flight 93 National Memorial at the crash site near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and at the National 9/11 Memorial in New York City, at the South Pool, on Panel S-67, along with other passengers on Flight 93.[14]\nOn September 11, 2002, Glick was posthumously awarded the Medal for Heroism, the highest civilian honor bestowed by the Sons of the American Revolution (SAR).[15]\nGlick's sister, Joanna Glick, who finished tenth in the 2001 Junior National Amateur Figure Skating competition, skated a tribute to her brother at a benefit at Madison Square Garden, for which she received a standing ovation. Joanna, who was profiled in Joe McNally's portrait book, Faces of Ground Zero, said of her brother: \"He was so strong. I was thinking I should be strong too. Jeremy lives in our hearts. Love, freedom and bravery live on forever.\"[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nHerman Webster Mudgett (May 16, 1861 \u2013 May 7, 1896), better known as Dr. Henry Howard Holmes or H. H. Holmes, was an American con artist and serial killer, the subject of more than 50 lawsuits in Chicago alone. Until his execution in 1896, he chose a career of crime including insurance fraud, swindling, check forging, three to four bigamous illegal marriages, horse theft and murder.\nDespite his confession of 27 murders (including some people who were verifiably still alive) while awaiting execution,[1] Holmes was convicted and sentenced to death for only one murder, that of accomplice and business partner Benjamin Pitezel. It is believed he killed three of the Pitezel children, as well as three mistresses, the child of one of his mistresses and the sister of another.[2] Holmes was executed on May 7, 1896, nine days before his 35th birthday.[3]\nMuch of the lore surrounding the \"Murder Castle\" along with many of his alleged crimes are considered likely exaggerated or fabricated for sensationalistic tabloid pieces. Many of these factual inaccuracies have persisted due to the combination of ineffective police investigation and hyperbolic tabloid journalism, which are often cited as historical record.[4] Holmes gave various contradictory accounts of his life, initially claiming innocence and later that he was possessed by Satan. His propensity for lying has made it difficult for researchers to ascertain the truth on the basis of his statements.[5]\nSince the 1990s, Holmes has often been described as a serial killer. In his book about Holmes, Adam Selzer writes, \"Just killing several people isn't necessarily enough for most definitions [of a serial killer]. More often, it has to be a series of similar crimes, committed over a period of time, usually more to satisfy a psychological urge on the killer's part than any more practical motive.\" He added, \"The murders we can connect him [Holmes] to generally had a clear motive: someone knew too much, or was getting in his way, and couldn't be trusted. The murders weren't simply for love of bloodshed but a necessary part of furthering his swindling operations and protecting his lifestyle.\"[6]\nHolmes was born as Herman Webster Mudgett in Gilmanton, New Hampshire, on May 16, 1861, to Levi Horton Mudgett and Theodate Page Price, both of whom were descended from the first English immigrants in the area. Mudgett was his parents' third-born child; he had an older sister Ellen, an older brother Arthur, a younger brother Henry, and a younger sister Mary.[7][8] Holmes's father was from a farming family, and at times he worked as a farmer, trader, and house painter; his parents were devout Methodists.[9] Later attempts to fit Holmes into the patterns seen in modern serial killers have described him torturing animals and suffering from abuse at the hands of a violent father, but contemporary and eyewitness accounts of his childhood do not provide proof of either.[6]\nAt the age of 16, Holmes graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and took teaching jobs in Gilmanton and later in nearby Alton. On July 4, 1878, he married Clara Lovering in Alton; their son, Robert Lovering Mudgett, was born on February 3, 1880, in Loudon, New Hampshire. Robert became a certified public accountant and served as city manager of Orlando, Florida.[citation needed]\nHolmes enrolled in the University of Vermont in Burlington at age 18 but was dissatisfied with the school and left after one year. In 1882, he entered the University of Michigan's Department of Medicine and Surgery[10] and graduated in June 1884 after passing his exams.[11] While enrolled, he worked in the anatomy lab under Professor William James Herdman, then the chief anatomy instructor, and the two were said to have been engaged in facilitating grave robbing to supply medical cadavers.[12][13] Holmes had apprenticed in New Hampshire under Nahum Wight, a noted advocate of human dissection.[6] Years later, when Holmes was suspected of murder and claimed to be nothing but an insurance fraudster, he admitted to using cadavers to defraud life insurance companies several times in college.[6]\nHousemates described Holmes as treating Clara violently, and in 1884, before his graduation, she moved back to New Hampshire and later wrote she knew little of him afterwards.[14] After he moved to Mooers Forks, New York, a rumor spread that Holmes had been seen with a little boy who later disappeared. Holmes claimed the boy went back to his home in Massachusetts. No investigation took place and Holmes quickly left town.[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nBakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union\nThe 2021 Kellogg's strike was a labor strike started on October 5, 2021 and ended December 21, 2021 involving about 1,400 workers for food manufacturer Kellogg's, unionized as members of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union (BCTGM). The strike was caused due to disagreements between the union and company concerning the terms of a new labor contract, with particular points of contention concerning the current two-tier wage system (with legacy workers making $35/hr and new hires $22/hr), health care, holidays, retirement benefits, cost-of-living adjustments, and vacation time.[1] The strike affected all of Kellogg's cereal-producing plants in the United States, consisting of plants in Battle Creek, Michigan; Omaha, Nebraska; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; and Memphis, Tennessee. It is one of several strikes conducted by the BCTGM in 2021, including strike action against Frito-Lay and Nabisco.[2][3]\nThe strike is the first to affect Kellogg's Battle Creek plant since 1972, and the first at the Lancaster plant since 1985.[4][5] The strike ended after union workers voted to approve a new five-year labor contract.[6]\nKellogg's is an American food manufacturer that derives about a third of its profits from its line of breakfast cereals, which includes brands such as Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes.[7][8] In the United States, the company operated four cereal-producing plants in Battle Creek, Michigan (also where the company is headquartered); Omaha, Nebraska; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; and Memphis, Tennessee.[9] Going into October 2021, the company had been negotiating for over a year with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union (BCTGM),[9] a labor union that represents about 1,400 workers at these plants.[2][10] The union and company had had a rough relationship over the past several years, with the company performing a lockout at their Memphis plant in 2013 and 2014,[11] firing about 187 workers at their Battle Creek plant in 2018, and in September 2021,[12] announcing that they would be firing about another 200 employees from that plant, a majority of whom would be union employees.[13] One worker, describing the situation at the Lancaster plant, compared it to a \"death of a thousand cuts\".[13][14] While the contract between the union and company had expired in 2020, an extension renewed the existing contract until October 2021.[15]\nOn September 8 and 9, 2021, both sides submitted their proposals for a new contract and entered into discussions on them.[16] However, during the negotiations, the parties could not agree on several key issues, including policies regarding health care, holidays, retirement benefits, and vacation time.[8][17] In particular, Kellogg's was seeking to expand a two-tier employee system composed of \"legacy\" and \"transitional\" employees. According to the company, legacy employees average $35 per hour, and newer \"transitional\" employees make $22 per hour.[1] Under the system that had been in place in the prior five-year contract, transitional employees received less pay and reduced benefits compared to the legacy employees, but only 30% of all employees could be classified as transitional.[3] Kellogg's, however, was seeking to remove this cap, which the union alleged would cause a majority of employees to become classified as transitional.[3] The union was opposed to these changes and also stated that the company was threatening to move some production work to Mexico if these changes were not implemented.[8][9][18] In response, Omaha, Nebraska BCTGM local president Daniel Osborn said: \"A lot of Americans probably don\u2019t have too much issue with the Nike or Under Armor hats being made elsewhere or even our vehicles, but when they start manufacturing our food down where they are out of the FDA control and OSHA control, I have a huge problem with that.\"[19] In addition, the president of BCTGM Local 3G stated that the company was seeking to remove cost-of-living adjustments and stop offering pensions to new employees.[13]\nThe strike began at 1:00 a.m. the next day,[4] October 5, 2021, with picketing commencing outside Kellogg's facilities.[20][21] The strike affected all four of Kellogg's American production facilities,[9] with all of them ceasing operations.[22] The same day, the company stated that they were \"implementing contingency plans\" to reduce supply disruptions,[9][21] with one union member stating that the company would try to bring in strikebreakers.[22] The company later clarified that they would be using \"salaried employees and third-party resources\" to cover for the strikers.[23][24] Additionally, Newsweek reported that whether the strike would significantly affect supply of Kellogg's products remained unclear.[25] Shortly after the start of the strike, Battle Creek Mayor Mark Behnke urged both sides to return to negotiations.[26] Speaking to HuffPost, a union spokesperson stated that while the union was not officially instituting a boycott, \"supporters and consumers could certainly support the Kellogg workers and their fight for a fair contract by choosing NOT to buy Kellogg cereals while the strike is ongoing.\"[3] According to the union, the strike was open-ended and would continue until a new contract was agreed to.[27] On October 11, third-party contractors began to arrive at Kellogg's plants to serve as replacements for the striking workers.[28] The next day, Kellogg's issued a press release in which they clarified the \"myths\" and \"facts\" of the contract proposal and working conditions at their plants.[29] Following this, the president of Omaha's Local 50G stated that he was recommending strikers return to work for a 90-day period under the terms of the previous contract while a new contract could be ratified.[30] Despite this, a negotiator for Local 50G stated on October 13 that negotiations remained at an impasse.[31] That same day, a large rally was held near the factory that was attended by strike supporters and members of several other labor union groups, including members of the AFL\u2013CIO's Omaha Federation of Labor.[31] The rally's speaker was the president emeritus of that federation, who had previously worked at the Kellogg's plant.[31][32] Around this same time, a photograph of a striker picketing through a torrential rainstorm in Omaha on October 12 went viral online,[32] with many sharing the image and commenting in support of the strike.[33]\nOn October 14, several members of the Nebraska Legislature, including Carol Blood, Megan Hunt, Mike McDonnell, and Tony Vargas, issued a press release in support of the strikers and urging Kellogg's to bargain in good faith with the union.[34] The next day, Newsweek reported that Kellogg's had released an advertisement seeking replacement workers willing to \"cross the picket line\" and help with production while the strike was occurring, with the ad stating, \"While these are temporary positions at this time, they could lead to permanent opportunities in the future.\"[35]\nProposed agreement\n",

        "paragraph": "The Eddie Polec murder case centers on the murder of a 16-year-old Edward William Polec.[1] that took place on the front steps of his church in the Philadelphia Fox Chase neighborhood on the night of Friday, November 11, 1994. The case drew national media attention because it happened in a middle-class residential part of the city not customarily known for such a crime. Adding to its controversy was that it was carried out by a band of mixed-race youth from neighboring Montgomery County's upscale suburban Abington Township.[1][2] The Philadelphia 911 emergency phone service and the Philadelphia police were extraordinarily slow in responding that night.[1][3]\nThe murder of Eddie Polec was the end result of minor hostilities that had developed between Fox Chase youth and a young female from Abington Township the week before, outside a Fox Chase McDonald's Restaurant. A group of Fox Chase teenagers were alleged to have upset the girl by tossing a plastic cup of soda into her car. This much was later admitted to by the Fox Chase youth.[1] But when word of the incident got back to Abington Township, it grew out of proportion to include a false rumor that she had been raped in the McDonald's parking lot.[1][2] In response, a group of Abington teenagers decided to retaliate on her behalf in conjunction with a warning she had allegedly made the night of the initial incident just before departing Fox Chase: \"You're all getting [expletive] beat up next weekend.[4]\"\nAccording to witnesses, she was seen again in Fox Chase early the following Friday night driving the same vehicle, this time along with Abington youth in another car, the passengers of both cars making threats similar to the one she had made the week before, only this time for later that night. Both vehicles then departed Fox Chase, and around 9:30 P.M. five carloads packed with other Abington teenagers arrived in their wake in what was described as a tightly formed caravan.[1] It first stopped at a Fox Chase 7-Eleven store, and after taking over its parking lot, some of its passengers got out and demanded directions to the McDonald's. The one perceived to be the leader was overheard to say, \"Come on, we have to do this. We have a job to get done. Let's do this before the police come.\" Before returning to their cars he was witnessed jumping up and down shouting: \"I'm so psyched, I could kill someone.[1]\"\nJust before 10:00 P.M.[5] the caravan arrived at the McDonald's . Its passengers then jumped out and began chasing every Fox Chase youth they saw with broken off hockey sticks[4] and baseball bats. According to one account, they outnumbered the Fox Chase teenagers thirteen to two. They cornered one and began severely beating him with bats until his friends could pull him free. The Fox Chase teenagers then scattered, but the rampage spread out to encompass a much wider portion of Fox Chase.\nResidents witnessing the melee overtaking their normally peaceful neighborhood began calling Philadelphia's 911 emergency response service in growing numbers, each caller expecting police to be sent out right away.[4] Some callers described what looked to be as many as 40 to 50 kids shouting obscenities,[4] smashing bottles, hurling rocks, and breaking car windows.[1]\nBut with no police patrol cars being dispatched, the caravan began racing recklessly throughout Fox Chase until finally zeroing in on one particular young male it saw near to the front steps of his church, Eddie Polec, who had been waiting there to walk home with his younger brother when he found himself being chased down by the succession of cars coming toward him. As the caravan sharply pulled into the church's parking lot cutting him off while simultaneously blocking other Fox Chase youth from coming to his aid, he tried running farther, but the first passenger out threw a baseball bat at his legs causing him to fall. The moment he was down that Abington teenager and others began striking him with baseball bats as he helplessly lay on the ground pleading for his life. He was then brought back to his feet once more so that some in the group could take bat swings directly at his head. After suffering eight forceful blows to the head this way he was then dropped back to the pavement, at which point another, wearing steel tipped boots, kicked him several times in the face.[5] With that final assault, the assailants then quickly fled in their caravan and were said to have been laughing and high-fiving one another as it sped away.[1] Authorities would later describe it as having been one of the most brutal murders in all Philadelphia history.[5]\nIt was 40 minutes after the first 911 call was placed that police were finally sent.[4] But by then it was too late. The young Eddie Polec lay bloodied and unconscious on the steps of a church where just a few short years before he had served as an altar boy.[1][6] He was immediately rushed to a hospital. But the following morning, after a full night of intensive medical emergency treatment had failed, Eddie Polec was pronounced dead.[1][4]\nAs the news of his death broke, it would later come out that while Eddie Polec's friends gathered in mourning outside the church where he had been killed the night before, four teenage girls from Abington who had been part of the caravan the night before attended a party for a friend just a few blocks away from the church, by all accounts totally unfazed by it.[1]\nThe news coverage of Eddie Polec's murder quickly went national, with the failure on the part of Philadelphia's 911 operators receiving special emphasis, much of the blame being placed directly on them. Fox Chase residents and others had complained about them being insensitive and unresponsive, and even expressing resentment as the callers tried to make clear the matter's urgency. The head of the union representing the operators stated that the reason for their questionable performance was because they had been working with outdated equipment, were underpaid, and had not been trained properly by the city. Nonetheless, Philadelphia's Mayor Ed Rendell took immediate disciplinary action against them, saying, \"Flaws in the system in no way, shape or form give anybody license to be abusive to citizens calling to report a crime.[4]\" In their own defense the operators soon after appeared on ABC's The Oprah Winfrey Show,[1][7] where they tried to argue that they had done a good job that night. But 911 tapes that had been released by the police and that were getting extensive airplay nationally by that point only confirmed the callers' accusations.[4] The 911 operators themselves, meantime, believed that because they were all African American they were being made political scapegoats.[1][4] But that claim was denounced by the president of Philadelphia's branch of the NAACP, Thornhill Cosby, who said: \"This is not a racial issue. It is a human issue.[3]\" The 911 workers appealed the city's disciplinary action and were eventually exonerated. The mayor, meantime, created a commission to explore ways the 911 system could be improved upon[4]\n",

After finishing his secondary education at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, he went to Harvard University where he received his bachelor's degree in 1922 and Ph.D. in 1927. His Ph.D. thesis established a chronology of Maya ceramics. Later on, his work launched the historical sequence of cultures in pre-Columbian Mexico.\nDuring his college years, he worked at the Harvard Peabody Museum, and continued on excavating in Pecos, New Mexico. At the American Museum of Natural History in New York, N.Y., Vaillant was appointed the position of Assistant Curator in 1927, and promoted to Associate Curator three years later. He became an Honorary Curator at AMNH in 1941, when he accepted an invitation to become the Museum Director at the University of Pennsylvania. His position there was interrupted during the war when he became an Honorary Professor at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico in 1942, followed by a year in Peru where he served as the US State Department Cultural Relations Officer stationed in Lima (1943-1944). In 1944, he returned to Philadelphia, resuming his museum directorship at Penn.\nVaillant conducted archaeological expeditions in the Southwest from 1921 to 1922 and 1922 to 1925, in Egypt from 1923 to 1924, and in Central America in 1926 and 1928 to 1936. He also organized archaeological programs throughout Latin America. Three major excavation sites in the Basin of Mexico, Zacatenco, Ticom\u00e1n, and El Arbolillo, are located.\nAztecs of Mexico: Origins, Rise and Fall of the Aztec Nation was completed in 1941, and a second edition was published posthumously. His other book, Indian Arts in North America, was written in 1939. Vaillant also wrote several monographs on Middle American excavations.\nVaillant was known for the reconstruction of the early stages of Mexican Culture. His excavations at Zacatenco, Ticom\u00e1n and El Arbollo established the framework for the Formative or Preclassic period in central Mexico. He was also known for his synthesis of Aztec history, which is also written in Aztecs in Mexico. Throughout his research of relating archaeology to the events and descriptions of colonial sources and Mexican traditions, Vaillant concentrated on problems of chronology and culture history. Later in his career Vaillant excavated at several Aztec sites (Chiconautla and Nonoalco), but  failed to publish these projects. Several decades later Christina Elson and other scholars at the American Museum of Natural History completed the study of artifacts from these sites and began a program to publish them.\nVaillant shot himself in Devon, Pennsylvania in 1945, at the age of 44. His wife found him in their yard, a revolver next to him and a fatal wound through his head. The last person to see him alive was his elder son and namesake, George Eman Vaillant, who at that time was 10 years old.<ref>\n",

This flight was one of several flights considered as possibly hijacked, but landed safely at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.\nDelta Air Lines still uses Flight\u00a01989 on its international service from their main hub at Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport to Daniel Oduber Quir\u00f3s International Airport in Liberia, Costa Rica, as operated by a Boeing 737-900ER.[1] N189DN is still in operation, though it had been stored from March 2020 until early 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[2]\nTwo aircraft that departed Boston's Logan Airport on September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight\u00a011 and United Airlines Flight\u00a0175, were hijacked by terrorists as part of the September 11 attacks. After the hijacked planes struck the World Trade Center, Boston Center air traffic controllers realized that both aircraft were Boeing\u00a0767s departing Logan Airport for Los Angeles. Delta\u00a01989 fit the same profile as other hijacked flights: it had also departed Logan Airport for Los Angeles and was also a Boeing\u00a0767.[3] Boston Center staff notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about their suspicions at 09:19 EDT (9:19 AM) when the FAA's New England regional office contacted the Herndon Command Center and asked Herndon to relay a request that Cleveland Center notify Delta\u00a01989 to increase cockpit security. Herndon then ordered controllers to send a cockpit warning to Delta\u00a01989.[4] Boston was tracking Delta\u00a01989 and not receiving any radio contact from the aircraft. In fact, Delta\u00a01989 was in Cleveland airspace and in contact with Cleveland Air Traffic Control Center.\nThe FAA had read Delta\u00a01989 to be in Cleveland airspace and ordered Cleveland Center to watch for Delta\u00a01989 as a suspected hijacking. A Cleveland controller thought he heard \"Get out of here\" and \"We have a bomb on board\" coming from Delta\u00a01989. The Delta pilot denied any cockpit intrusion and stated that everyone on board was fine. It was later confirmed that the transmission had come from United Airlines Flight\u00a093, which was in the same vicinity as Delta\u00a01989, and would later crash into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after the passengers and crew revolted against the hijackers.[3] The NORAD Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) became aware of Delta\u00a01989 right after the crash of American Airlines Flight\u00a077 into The Pentagon at 09:37 when Boston Center called NEADS at 09:41 EDT and told NEADS of the suspicions regarding Delta\u00a01989. At 09:42 EDT, the FAA ordered all aircraft in flight to land at the nearest airport. NEADS dispatched fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept the flight, though Delta\u00a01989 never turned off its transponder and NEADS never lost radar contact with the aircraft. NEADS, the FAA Herndon Command Center, and Cleveland Center tracked Delta\u00a01989 until its eventual landing.[3]\nAfter pilots reported an unruly Middle Eastern passenger and due to confusion and lack of communication between Boston and Cleveland, Delta ordered Flight\u00a01989 to land at Cleveland.

        "paragraph": "\nThe Penn State child sex abuse scandal concerned allegations and subsequent convictions of child sexual abuse committed by Jerry Sandusky, an assistant coach for the Penn State Nittany Lions football team, over a period of at least fifteen years. The scandal began to emerge publicly in March 2011 and broke in early November 2011 when Sandusky was indicted on 52 counts of child molestation, stemming from incidents that occurred between 1994 and 2009.[1] Sandusky was ultimately convicted on 45 counts of child sexual abuse on June 22, 2012,[2] and was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of 60 years in prison.[3]\nAdditionally, three Penn State officials \u2013 school president Graham Spanier, vice president Gary Schultz and athletic director Tim Curley \u2013 were charged with perjury, obstruction of justice, failure to report suspected child abuse, and related charges.[4] The Penn State Board of Trustees commissioned an independent investigation by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, whose report stated that Penn State's longtime head football coach Joe Paterno, along with Spanier, Curley and Schultz, had known about allegations of child abuse by Sandusky as early as 1998, had shown \"total and consistent disregard...for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims\", and \"empowered\" Sandusky to continue his acts of abuse by failing to disclose them.[5]:\u200a14\u200a[6][7] Shortly after the scandal broke, Spanier resigned. The Board of Trustees terminated the contracts of Paterno and Curley.\nAs a result of the scandal, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) imposed sanctions on the Penn State football program: a $60 million fine, a four-year postseason ban, scholarship reductions, and a vacation of all victories from 1998 to 2011.[8] These sanctions were considered to be among the most severe ever imposed on an NCAA member school. NCAA President Mark Emmert stated that the sanctions were levied \"not to be just punitive, but to make sure the university establishes an athletic culture and daily mindset in which football will never again be placed ahead of educating, nurturing and protecting young people.\"[9][10] The Big Ten Conference subsequently imposed an additional $13 million fine.[11]\nThe Paterno family retained former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to conduct a review of the Freeh report, which concluded that the report constituted a \"rush to injustice\" that could not be relied upon[12][13] and that Freeh's evidence fell \"far short\" of showing that Joe Paterno attempted to conceal the scandal, but rather that \"the contrary is true\".[13] In January 2013, state senator Jake Corman and state treasurer Rob McCord sued the NCAA, seeking to overturn the Penn State sanctions on the basis that Freeh had been actively collaborating with the organization and that due process had not been followed. In November 2014, Corman released emails showing \"regular and substantive\" contact between Freeh's investigators and the NCAA, suggesting that Freeh's conclusions were orchestrated.[14] As part of a settlement, the NCAA restored the 111 wins to Paterno's record on January 16, 2015.[15][10]\nOn March 25, 2017, Curley, Schultz, and Spanier pleaded or were found guilty of misdemeanor charges of child endangerment.[16] All conspiracy charges against Curley and Schultz were dropped, and Spanier was acquitted of conspiracy, the charges central to Louis Freeh's allegation of a cover-up.[17][18] In June 2017, all three were sentenced to jail terms, fines, and probation for the misdemeanors.[19] Spanier was sentenced to four to twelve months in jail, a $7,500 fine, and two years of probation.[20] Spanier's misdemeanor conviction was overturned by the federal district court, but reinstated by the court of appeals in December 2020.[21][22]\nJerry Sandusky was an assistant coach for the Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 1969 to 1999.[23] For the last 23 of those years, Sandusky was the team's defensive coordinator.[24] In 1977, he founded The Second Mile in State College, Pennsylvania,  a charity formed to help disadvantaged youth.\n[25] Sandusky retired from the organization in 2010.[23] In 1998, he was investigated for child sexual abuse but no charges were filed.[26] Sandusky was considered for spearheading the startup of a football program at Penn State Altoona in 1998\u201399, but the idea was scrapped and he retired in 1999.[27] After his retirement, Sandusky remained a coach emeritus with an office in and access to Penn State's football facilities per his employment contract.[28]\nIn Pennsylvania, a grand jury only recommends criminal charges. It hears all of the available evidence but does not have authority to indict the accused.[29]  In the case of Sandusky, the grand jury investigation began in 2009 under commonwealth attorney general and later-governor Tom Corbett. The grand jury subpoenaed records from both Penn State and The Second Mile, and heard testimony from Victim 1 (Aaron Fisher), Mike McQueary, Joe Paterno, Tim Curley, Gary Schultz, Victim 7, Graham Spanier, Victim 4, and Ronald Petrosky (Penn State janitor).[30] This grand jury did not recommend indictment.\nCommonwealth attorney general Linda L. Kelly prepared a presentment which included credibility determinations about the testimonies received before the first grand jury for the second grand jury. This second grand jury heard testimony from Victim 3,[30] Victim 5, and Victim 6. Kelly said that during the investigation there was an \"uncooperative atmosphere\" from some Penn State officials.[31]\nThe investigation was initiated in the spring of 2008 after Aaron Fisher (identified in court papers as \"Victim 1\"), then a freshman at Central Mountain High School in Mill Hall, Pennsylvania, reported that Sandusky had been molesting him since age 12.[32] Fisher met Sandusky through The Second Mile in the mid-2000s,[23] when Sandusky began making advances toward Fisher which involved \"inappropriate touching\".[33] At the time of the alleged actions, Sandusky was volunteering as an assistant football coach at Central Mountain High School, where these assaults took place.[34]\n",

It was reported he was chosen by Osama bin Laden to participate in terrorist attacks in the United States and arrived in the U.S. in June 2001. During his stay in the U.S., he quietly settled in Florida, planning out how the attacks would commence and training on flight simulators.[1]\nOn September 11, 2001, he boarded United 93 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which was diverted toward Washington D.C. under the control of lead hijacker and trained pilot Ziad Jarrah so that Jarrah could crash the plane into either the U.S. Capitol or the White House, as part of the coordinated attacks. The plane instead crashed into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, after the passengers attempted to retake control of the plane in an uprising.\nSaeed al-Ghamdi was from the al-Bahah Province of Saudi Arabia, and shared the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers Ahmed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Haznawi, although he was not related to either al-Ghamdi. He may have been in contact with the two al-Ghamdi's and al-Haznawi as early as 1999.[2] This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers. al-Ghamdi spent time in al Qasim province, Saudi Arabia where he transferred to college but soon dropped out and ceased contact with his family. While there he probably associated with the radical Saudi cleric named Sulayman al-Alwan as several other future hijackers had.[2]\nAl-Ghamdi later headed to Chechnya to participate in the conflict against the Russians. At this time, Chechen fighters were turning away additional foreigners, many of whom ended up in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan to train and await entry to Chechnya. Saeed ended up at the Al Farouq training camp, where he met Ahmed al-Nami, and the brothers Wail and Waleed al-Shehri. The four reportedly pledge themselves to Jihad in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail Al-Shehri\u2014who had dubbed himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions.[3]\nSaeed Al-Ghamdi was known to Tawfiq bin Attash who is thought to have convinced him to become a martyr. Al-Ghamdi was at that time working as a security guard at Kandahar airport along with Waleed al-Shehri.\nSome time late in 2000, al-Ghamdi traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's cheques presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including Majed Moqed, Wail al-Shehri, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami.\nOn November 13, 2000, another Saeed al-Ghamdi[4] tried to obtain a visa to enter the United States, but was declined. Although the 9/11 Commission makes mention of him, there is no evidence he was associated with the hijackers.\nIn March 2001, al-Ghamdi was filmed in a farewell video that was later aired on al-Jazeera. In the video, many future 9/11 hijackers swear to become martyrs, although no details of the plot are revealed. al-Ghamdi referred to America as \"the enemy\", and is seen studying maps and flight manuals.[5]\n",

He became president of the United Mine Workers of America union in 1963, serving until 1972. Boyle was convicted in 1974 of charges of conspiracy in the murder of opponent Joseph A. Yablonski, Yablonski's wife Margaret, and their daughter Charlotte, on New Year's Eve, December 31, 1969. After an appeal, his conviction and sentence were upheld at a second trial; he was sentenced to three life terms and died while still incarcerated. \nYablonski had opposed Boyle for some time, arguing for more democratic representation among the locals, and had run against him in a bitter presidency election of the UMWA earlier in December, which Boyle won. Yablonski charged that fraud had been committed, asking for a Department of Labor investigation, and also filing five lawsuits against the union on specific related civil charges.\nBoyle was born in a gold mining camp in Bald Butte, Montana (about two miles southwest of Marysville), in 1904 to James and Catherine (Mallin) Boyle. His father was a miner. The Boyle family was of Irish descent, and several generations of Boyles had worked as miners in England and Scotland.[citation needed] Boyle attended public schools in Montana and Idaho before graduating from high school.[1] He went to work in the mines alongside his father. Shortly thereafter, Boyle's father died from tuberculosis, a lung disease often associated with mining, or exacerbated by its conditions.\nBoyle married Ethel Williams in 1928; they had a daughter, Antoinette.\nBoyle joined the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) soon after going to work in the mines. He was appointed president of District 27 (which covers Montana) and served in that capacity until 1948. During World War II, Boyle served on several government wartime production boards, and on the Montana State Unemployment Compensation Commission.\nIn 1948, UMWA president John L. Lewis named Boyle as his assistant in the UMWA. He served until 1960, acting as Lewis' chief trouble-shooter and the union's chief administrator. Lewis simultaneously appointed him director of UMWA District 50 and regional director of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) for four Western states.\nBoyle was elected vice president of UMWA in 1960. That same year, Lewis retired and 73-year-old Thomas Kennedy assumed leadership of the union. Kennedy had been vice president since 1947. Although Lewis favored Boyle as his successor, Kennedy was well liked and well known.  Kennedy was in failing health, however, and Boyle took over many of the president's duties. In November 1962, Kennedy became too frail and ill to continue his duties. Boyle was named acting-president. Kennedy died on January 19, 1963. Boyle was elected president shortly thereafter, obviously Lewis's handpicked choice.\nFrom the beginning of his tenure, Boyle faced significant opposition from rank-and-file miners and UMWA leaders. Miners' attitudes about their union had changed. Miners wanted greater democracy and more local autonomy for their local unions.[citation needed] There was a widespread belief that Boyle was more concerned with protecting mine owners' interests than those of his members. Grievances filed by the union often took months\u2014sometimes years\u2014to resolve, lending credence to the critics' claim. Wildcat strikes occurred as local unions, despairing of UMWA assistance, sought to resolve local disputes with walkouts.[citation needed]\nIn 1969, Joseph \"Jock\" Yablonski challenged Boyle for the presidency of UMWA.  Yablonski had been president of UMWA District 5 (an appointed position) until Boyle had removed him in 1965. In an election widely seen as corrupt,[citation needed] Boyle defeated Yablonski in the election held on December 9 by a margin of nearly two-to-one (80,577 to 46,073). Although Boyle won, the election was the first time since 1920 that the incumbents had less than 80 percent or more of the vote, or that there was any opposition at all. Observers expected the union to make changes in response to the growing insurgency movement and demands for change.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Philadelphia transit strike of 1944 was a sickout strike by white transit workers in Philadelphia that lasted from August 1 to August 6, 1944.\nThe strike was triggered by the decision of the Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC), made under prolonged pressure from the federal government in view of significant wartime labor shortages, to allow black employees of the PTC to hold non-menial jobs, such as motormen and conductors, that were previously reserved for white workers only.[1][2] On August 1, 1944, the eight black employees being trained as streetcar motormen were due to make their first trial run.  That caused the white PTC workers to start a massive sickout strike.[1][3]\nThe strike paralyzed the public transport system in Philadelphia for several days, bringing the city to a standstill and crippling its war production. Although the Transport Workers Union (TWU) was in favor of allowing promotions of black workers to any positions they were qualified for, and opposed the strike, the union was unable to persuade the white PTC employees to return to work. On August 3, 1944, under the provisions of the Smith\u2013Connally Act,  President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson to take control of the Philadelphia Transportation Company, and Major-General Philip Hayes was put in charge of its operations. After several days of unsuccessful negotiations with the strike leaders, Hayes issued an order that the striking workers return to work on August 7, 1944, and that those refusing to comply be fired, stripped of their military draft deferment, and denied job availability certificates by the War Manpower Commission for the duration of the war. This ultimatum proved effective and on August 7, the strike ended and the strikers returned to work. The black workers, whose pending promotions to non-menial jobs triggered the strike, were allowed to assume those jobs.\nDuring the strike, despite considerable tensions, the city of Philadelphia remained mostly calm, and there were no major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested for violating the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.\nThe strike received considerable attention in the national media. The Philadelphia transit strike of 1944 is one of the most high-profile instances of the federal government invoking the Smith\u2013Connally Act.[4] The Act had been passed in 1943 over President Roosevelt's veto.[5]\nSince even before the official entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941, Philadelphia had been one on the major industrial war production centers in the U.S. By 1944 Philadelphia was regarded as the second largest war production center in the country (after Los Angeles).[1][6] During that period the black population of the city grew substantially, and tensions with the predominantly white population began to increase. The Philadelphia Transportation Company (PTC) ran the city's huge public transportation system, including subways, buses and trolleys; by the time of the strike, it carried over one million people per day.[1] By 1944, the PTC's eleven thousand strong workforce included 537 black employees.[7] However, the PTC's black workers had been restricted to holding menial jobs; none were allowed to serve as conductors or motormen \u2013 positions that were reserved for white employees.[7] As early as August 1941, black employees started pressuring the PTC for fairer employment practices that would allow upgrading of black workers to the more prestigious jobs reserved for whites. Their efforts were rebuffed by PTC management, who claimed that the current union contract contained a clause prohibiting any significant change in employment practices and customs without the union's approval (although the contract said nothing about race). The leader of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Employees Union (PRTEU), Frank Carney, proved to be equally reticent and claimed that he was not authorized by the union members to consider a request to allow promotions of black employees.[7]\nThe black PTC employees enlisted the help of the NAACP and started lobbying the federal authorities, particularly the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC), to intervene. The Fair Employment Practices Commission, created by an executive order of the President in 1941, was charged with ensuring non-discrimination employment practices by government contractors. Initially it was a fairly weak agency, but its authority was significantly strengthened in 1943 by a new executive order that required all government contracts to have a non-discrimination clause. As the war progressed, the manpower shortages were getting more severe. In January 1943 the PTC requested 100 white motormen from the United States Employment Service (USES),[8] which was a part of the  War Manpower Commission (WMC). The WMC, aware that PTC had a pool of black employees seeking upgrading, asked the PTC to allow hiring of black employees for the vacant motormen positions. The PTC refused, again citing the \"customs clause\" of its union contract.[8][9] After a complaint from the NAACP, the matter landed at the FEPC, headed at the time by Malcolm Ross.\nThe FEPC made a series of unsuccessful attempts to convince the PTC management and the union leadership to change their stance and to allow promotions of black employees to non-menial jobs. The PTC eventually conceded that it would be willing to go along with the government's request and \"employ Negroes, provided they are acceptable to fellow-workers\",[9] but the PRTEU leadership, particularly Frank Carney, staunchly resisted. On November 17, 1943, the FEPC issued a directive requiring that PTC end its discriminatory employment practices and allow blacks to hold non-menial jobs.[9] The directive also required the PTC to review all job applications from June 1941 and redress earlier employment abuses based on racial discrimination. The union immediately protested and requested a public hearing, which took place on December 8, 1943.[10] At the hearing the union tried to make the argument that hiring blacks who had applied for the non-menial positions since June 1941 but were denied would adversely affect the seniority rights of the presently employed white workers. Malcolm Ross rejected that argument, pointing out that the seniority rights only begin when an employee is actually hired for a particular job. On December 29, 1943, FEPC issued a second directive, reinforcing the first one.[10]\nIn an attempt to deflect the pressure, Carney and PRTEU contacted  Virginia congressman Howard W. Smith, who at the time was the Chair of the House Committee to Investigate Executive Agencies. Smith, known for his segregationist views and eager to embarrass and possibly destroy the FEPC,[11] quickly scheduled a hearing. In the meantime, the union informed the PTC that it refused to comply with the FEPC order, and the PTC management told Ross that, given the union's position, the PTC would not comply with the FEPC directive either.[10]  The hearing in front of Smith's committee took place on January 11, 1944.[12] The hearing was inconclusive, with Ross reiterating the FEPC position, and the union representatives falling back on the \"customs clause\" and their claims about seniority issues. Several white workers testifying at the hearing predicted that there would be trouble and unrest if promotions of black employees at the PTC were allowed: \"We are not going to accept them [the blacks] as fellow workers. ... We are not going to work with them. If anybody believe it, let them try it\".[13] A petition, signed by 1776 workers, presented at the hearing, read: \"Gentlemen: We, the white employees of the Philadelphia Transportation Co., refuse to work with Negroes as motormen, conductors, operators and station trainmen\".[13]\nAfter the January 11 congressional hearing, Ross delayed enforcement of the FEPC directive to await the outcome of the upcoming union elections. The PRTEU contract with the PTC was expiring on February 11, 1944 and a union election was called for March 14, 1944.[14] Apart from PRTEU, which was still staunchly opposed to promotions of black employees, there were two other unions competing for the right to represent PTC workers: the Transport Workers Union (TWU), which was a Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) affiliate, and the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, an American Federation of Labor (AFL) affiliate. The TWU said that it would allow promotions of black employees while the Amalgamated Association stayed silent on the matter. The PRTEU leadership tried to campaign on the race issue during the union elections, but the topic was overshadowed by other issues, such as the details of a new contract with the PTC. After a bitter campaign, the TWU won the union elections, receiving more votes than both of the other unions combined.[14][15] At the time of the elections many white workers perceived the contract issue to be more important, where the TWU was promising more attractive terms, and they did not consider promotions of black employees a realistic possibility.[14] Despite the TWU victory, animosities from white workers towards the black employees remained and were largely unabated.[14] The negotiations between the TWU and the PTC on a new contract dragged on, and in the absence of a contract the company continued to resist implementing the FEPC directives.[14]\n",

Unrest in the city began as a response to the murder of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Numerous protests, rallies and marches have taken place in Philadelphia in solidarity with protestors in Minneapolis and across the United States. These demonstrations call for justice for Floyd and protest police brutality. After several days of protests and riots, Philadelphia leadership joined other major cities, including Chicago in instituting a curfew, beginning Saturday, May 30, at 8 p.m. The protests concluded on June 23, 2020.[5]\nOn May\u00a025, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was murdered by a police officer, Derek Chauvin, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[6]\nDerek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down in the street, begging for his life and repeatedly saying \"I can't breathe\".[7][8]\nA second and third officer further restrained Floyd while a fourth prevented bystanders from intervening.[9] Videos of Floyd's murder circulated widely, and by the next day protests began in Minneapolis and later spread across the United States, including to Philadelphia, and then internationally.\nFloyd's murder is one of many widely publicized police killings of unarmed African-Americans in the United States. His murder has been compared[by whom?] to the 2014 killing of Eric Garner. Garner, also an unarmed black man, repeated \"I can't breathe\" eleven times after being placed in a chokehold by a New York police officer during an arrest in Staten Island, New York.[10][11]\nProtests began outside Philadelphia City Hall at noon. At City Hall, protestors knelt and engaged in nine minutes of silence, referencing the amount of time Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck.[13] At around 1 p.m., protestors marched from City Hall to the Philadelphia Museum of Art for a planned 2 p.m. demonstration.[14]\nLater protests included the burning of several police vehicles.[15] Several businesses in Center City Philadelphia were looted and a large fire broke out in a three-story building at 17th Street and Walnut Street.[16] A statue of Frank Rizzo, a former mayor and police commissioner, was spray-painted, and unsuccessful attempts were made to tear it down.  A number of protesters set fires under the statue using paper and scrape pieces of wood.[17] Removal of the statue has been discussed by Philadelphia officials since at least 2017.[18] A total of 13 police officers were injured and over 200 people were arrested.[16][19] A police officer was hit by a car while attempting to stop looters at 52nd Street and Chestnut Street; the officer was taken to the hospital with a broken arm and other injuries.[20] Mayor Jim Kenney issued a curfew effective at 8 p.m. on Saturday night.[16]\nThe Pennsylvania National Guard was called into Philadelphia during the second day of protests.[21] Workers and volunteers cleaned broken windows and trash in Center City.[22] Streets in Center City were closed to traffic. Looting and destruction continued in Center City and spread to other parts of the city including Northeast Philadelphia, North Philadelphia, and West Philadelphia.[23][24] Police cars were set on fire in West Philadelphia.[22] A curfew went into effect at 6 p.m.[23]\nOn this day, Police Staff Inspector Joseph Bologna was videoed lunging at a journalist, and hitting a security guard. He was also involved in other controversial incidents on June 1 and June 2.[25]\nDuring a large demonstration, hundreds of protesters split off from the group and marched onto Interstate 676 (Vine Street Expressway). When they were approximately halfway through a tunnel, a SWAT team appeared and began firing rubber bullets at protesters, prompting them to retreat. SWAT officers proceeded to fire tear gas and pepper spray into the crowd. Cell phone footage showed one SWAT officer pepper spraying a protester at point-blank range, while another officer pulled down a protester's mask before pepper spraying her in the face. Amid the commotion, police formed a line under an adjacent overpass, pinning the protesters in and forcing them up a steep fenced-in embankment. Police continued firing tear gas into the crowd as protesters clambered up the hill and over the 10-foot fence to escape. After several minutes, a group of police officers charged up the hill and began dragging down and arresting remaining protesters.[26]\nThe incident sparked outrage across the city. Later that day, Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney and police commissioner Danielle Outlaw defended the police's use of tear gas, claiming that protesters had charged a SWAT vehicle and threw rocks at officers. However, eyewitness reports from local journalists and protesters, as well as both cell phone and aerial footage, disputed these claims.[27]\n",

        "paragraph": "Michael Cheslock\nJames F. Martin\nThe Lattimer massacre was the violent deaths of at least 19 unarmed striking immigrant anthracite miners at the Lattimer mine near Hazleton, Pennsylvania, United States, on September 10, 1897.[1][page\u00a0needed][2][page\u00a0needed] The miners, mostly of Polish, Slovak, Lithuanian and German ethnicity, were shot and killed by a Luzerne County sheriff's posse. Scores more workers were wounded.[3][page\u00a0needed] The massacre was a turning point in the history of the United Mine Workers (UMW).[4]\nThe economies of Central and Eastern Europe were struggling in the late 19th century. The European rural population was growing faster than either the agricultural or new industrial sectors of the economy could absorb, industrialization was disrupting both the agricultural and craft economy, and there was increasing competition from large-scale commercial and foreign agricultural producers.[5][page\u00a0needed] These factors drove most of the mass immigration to the US.[5] Disproportionate numbers of new Slavic immigrants worked in the coal mining industry,[5] where they were among the most exploited of all mine workers.[4] During strikes in Northeast Pennsylvania by English-speaking miners in 1875 and 1887, many Slavic miners were imported as strikebreakers, and were \"despised as scabs\" by the English-speaking immigrant and American miners of the region.[6]\nConditions in coal mines of the late 19th century were harsh.  Mine safety was poor, such that 32,000 miners in Northeast Pennsylvania had died since 1870.[7] Wages, already low in a competitive industry, fell 17% during the mid-1890s after a coal industry slump.[4][8][page\u00a0needed] Although wages had improved some by the fall of 1897, anthracite coal companies in the region cut wages and consolidated operations within the mines (often resulting in more laborious working conditions).[4] In some cases, companies forced workers to lease homes from the company and required them to see only company doctors when injured.[4]\nIn August 1897, the Honey Brook division of the Lehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal Company laid off workers at its strip mines, cut the pay of the remaining employees, and raised fees for workers residing in the area's company towns.[4] The company consolidated its mule stables, forcing teenage mule drivers to travel much farther each day to pick up their mules (time for which they were not compensated).[4][9][page\u00a0needed] After inconclusive talks, 25 to 35 teenaged drivers struck on August 14, 1897.[4][9] A scuffle between a supervisor and some drivers led to additional walkouts by strip miners as well as underground coal miners, and by August 16 nearly 2,000 workers were on strike.[4][9] Nearly all the miners joined the UMW (United Mine Workers) on August 18, and within two days almost all the mines in the region had closed due to the spreading strike.[1] Many Slavic miners had not joined the nascent United Mine Workers, both because of ethnic discrimination exhibited by English-speaking and American miners but also because of the poor relationships between unionized miners and the former strikebreakers.[6] But worsening working conditions and a UMW call for a 15 percent wage increase drew many Slavic miners into the union.[1][10][page\u00a0needed]\nThe first wave of the strike ended on August 23, after the company agreed to pay overtime, bring wages up to the regional average, allow miners to see their own doctors when injured, and no longer force miners to live in company-owned housing.[4] A second strike began on August 25. Teenaged breaker boys at the A.S. Van Wickle coal breaker in the nearby village of Colerain struck for higher wages as well.[4] When Van Wickle attempted to use Slavic workers as strikebreakers, the Slavs joined the strike instead. Although the strike spread to two other nearby coal works, the company quickly agreed to raise wages up to the regional average and the strike ended on or about August 28.[4]\nBut when the new pay rates were announced on September 1, only a limited number of workers received raises.[4][10] Management did agree to treat Slavic workers more fairly,[10] but the mine owners reneged on their other promises.[4] The strikes resumed. On September 3, 3,000 workers marched on four mines, shutting them down.[1][11][page\u00a0needed]\nThe mine owners' private armed force, the Coal and Iron Police, proved too few in number to break the strike, so the owners appealed for help from Luzerne County Sheriff James F. Martin.[10] Martin established a posse of about 100 English and Irish citizens to prevent any further marches from occurring.[1][2] Within five days, 8,000 to 10,000 miners were on strike.[1][4][12][page\u00a0needed] On September 8, mine owners demanded that the sheriff of Schuylkill County arrest several thousand miners who had assembled near Pottsville and had forced a mine to shut down, but the sheriff refused.[10]\n",

On December 17, 1938, she met an unknown man who claimed to be offering her a secretarial job, and was never seen alive again. Her body was discovered in the wilderness 25 miles (40\u00a0km) away by a hunter four days later. Martin's death resulted in a lengthy manhunt. Numerous suspects were examined, but no one was ever convicted of the crime. As of 2023, it remains an unsolved case.\nMargaret Martin was a resident of Kingston, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.[2] She graduated from Kingston High School in 1937.[3] She took classes at the Wilkes-Barre Business College to gain secretarial skills and graduated with honors at the beginning of December 1938.[1][3] She was 19 years old at the time of her death.[2]\nAccording to Betty Hopkins, a former classmate, Martin was \"a shy, studious, friendly girl who had many friends.\"[3] Her parents described her as \"a living saint.\"[1] She was also a devout Catholic.[4]\nMartin's father was John Martin, a local foreman and minor politician.[1] Margaret Martin was the eldest of four children.[5]\nOn December 17, 1938, a man contacted Martin, claiming that he was setting up an insurance company and needed a secretary,[3] adding that he had heard of her through the Wilkes-Barre Business College.[6] The two agreed to meet in Kingston Corners, not far from Martin's home.[3]\nMartin was first noted to be missing that evening, after she had failed to return home from the alleged job interview.[2][3] Several witnesses said they saw her getting into a brown Plymouth or black sedan with a man after a brief conversation.[2][4][7] This was the last time she was seen alive.[2][3][4] The witnesses were able to give only vague descriptions of the man, described as a \"suave, neat, sandy-haired young man,\" and did not identify the car's license plate.[1][2] The man was between 25 and 30 years of age and slightly overweight.[4] Martin's friends and family called the police and started a search, but her disappearance was difficult to publicize since the local newspapers were on strike.[3]\nAccording to a 1999 article in the Times Leader, Martin was tortured and murdered in a sawmill in the mountains about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) from the creek where her body was found.[3] According to theories by the police, the killer had attempted to dismember her body and destroy it in the mill's firebox, but had been scared off by the mill's owner, James Kedd. Kedd had assumed that the killer was a mere trespasser and had fired a warning shot in the killer's direction.[3] The killer then drove to a point close to the creek and carried Martin's body the final 75 yards to the creek, where he abandoned it.[5]\nInitially, it was suspected that Martin's disappearance was linked to a sex slavery ring.[1] However, her body was discovered in the forested wilderness of Northmoreland Township, Wyoming County, on December 21, 1938, about 25 miles (40\u00a0km) from her home.[3][6][8] The discoverer was 19-year-old Anthony Rezykowski, who was trapping muskrats in the area.[2][3] Rezykowski noticed a large burlap bag partially submerged in 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of water in a creek.[5] Upon further investigation, he found the bag to contain the mutilated body of a young woman with no clothing. The body was soon identified as Margaret Martin.[2] At the time of her body's discovery, she had been dead for at least 24 hours. If not for Rezykowski's discovery of her body, it may have gone unnoticed for several years.[5]\nMartin's body showed signs of having been beaten\u2014perhaps with a rock\u2014and strangled.[2] She had bruises on her throat and body, as well as knife wounds on her stomach and thigh.[1][3] Her autopsy found the cause of death to be strangulation and stated that she had \"suffered the molestation of a degenerate.\"[1][2]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nMOVE, originally the Christian Movement for Life, is a communal organization that advocates for nature laws and natural living, founded in 1972 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, by John Africa (born Vincent Leaphart). The name, styled in all capital letters, is not an acronym. MOVE lived in a communal setting in West Philadelphia, abiding by philosophies of anarcho-primitivism.[1] The group combined revolutionary ideology, similar to that of the Black Panthers, with work for animal rights.\nMOVE is particularly known for two major conflicts with the Philadelphia Police Department (PPD). In 1978, a standoff resulted in the death of one police officer and injuries to 16 officers and firefighters, as well as members of the MOVE organization. Nine members were convicted of killing the officer and each received prison sentences of 30 to 100 years.[2] In 1985, another firefight ended when a police helicopter dropped two bombs onto the roof of the MOVE compound, a townhouse located at 6221 Osage Avenue.[3][4] The resulting fire killed six MOVE members and five of their children, and destroyed 65 houses in the neighborhood.[5]\nThe police bombing was strongly condemned. The MOVE survivors later filed a civil suit against the City of Philadelphia and the PPD and were awarded $1.5 million in a 1996 settlement.[6] Other residents displaced by the destruction of the bombing filed a civil suit against the city and in 2005 were awarded $12.83 million in damages in a jury trial.\nThe group's name, MOVE, is not an acronym.[7] Its founder, John Africa, chose this name to say what they intended to do. Members intend to be active because they say, \"Everything that's alive moves. If it didn't, it would be stagnant, dead.\"[8] When members greet each other they say \"on the MOVE\".[8]\nWhen the organization that would become MOVE was founded in 1972, John Africa was functionally illiterate.[9] John Africa dictated his thoughts to Donald Glassey, a social worker from the University of Pennsylvania, and created what he called \"The Guidelines\" as the basis of his communal group.[1] Africa and his mostly African-American followers wore their hair in dreadlocks, as popularized by the Caribbean Rastafari movement. MOVE advocated a radical form of green politics and a return to a hunter-gatherer society, while stating their opposition to science, medicine, and technology.[10]\nMembers of MOVE identify as deeply religious and advocate for life. They believe that as all living beings are dependent, their lives should be treated as equally important. They advocate for justice that is not always based within institutions. MOVE members believe that for something to be just, it must be just for all living creatures.[8] As John Africa had done, his followers changed their surnames to Africa to show reverence to what they regarded as their mother continent.[6][11][12]\nIn a 2018 article about the group, Ed Pilkington of The Guardian described their political views as \"a strange fusion of black power and flower power. The group that formed in the early 1970s melded the revolutionary ideology of the Black Panthers with the nature- and animal-loving communalism of 1960s hippies. You might characterise them as black liberationists-cum-eco warriors.\"[13] He noted the group also functioned as an animal rights advocacy organization. Pilkington quoted member Janine Africa, who wrote to him from prison: \"We demonstrated against puppy mills, zoos, circuses, any form of enslavement of animals. We demonstrated against Three Mile Island and industrial pollution. We demonstrated against police brutality. And we did so uncompromisingly. Slavery never ended, it was just disguised.\"[13]\nJohn Africa and his followers lived in a commune in a house owned by Glassey in the Powelton Village section of West Philadelphia. As activists, they staged bullhorn-amplified, profanity-laced demonstrations against institutions that they opposed, such as zoos, and speakers whose views they opposed. MOVE activities were scrutinized by law enforcement authorities,[14][15] particularly under the administration of Mayor Frank Rizzo, a former police commissioner known for his hard line against activist groups.[13]\n",

The West Nickel Mines School was later demolished, and a new one-room schoolhouse, the New Hope School, was built at another location.\nRoberts backed a pickup truck to the front of the Amish schoolhouse and entered it at approximately 10:25\u00a0a.m. EDT, soon after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said he mumbled his words and did not make direct eye contact. After they said they had not seen a clevis pin, he went back to his truck and reentered the school holding a Springfield Armory XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the truck. Zook and her mother, who was visiting, took this opportunity to escape and run toward a nearby farm for help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if they got away.[5]\nThey reached the farm, where they asked Amos Smoker to call 9-1-1. Meanwhile, the boys carried in lumber, a shotgun, a stun-gun, wires, chains, nails, tools, a small bag and wooden board with multiple sets of metal eye-hooks. The bag held a change of clothes, toilet paper, candles, and flexible plastic ties. Using wooden boards, Roberts barricaded the front door.[5]\nRoberts ordered the girls to line up against the chalkboard and allowed a pregnant woman, three parents with infants, and all remaining boys to exit. One girl, nine-year-old Emma Fisher, escaped without her older sister.[6]\nSmoker's 9-1-1 call was recorded at 10:36\u00a0a.m.  An article, \"Revisiting the Amish Schoolhouse Massacre\", described the situation prior to the arrival of the first Pennsylvania State Police troopers: \"An Amish adult male from this farm, with his two large dogs, took the bold opportunity to stealthily approach the windowless back wall of the schoolhouse. Hoping for an opportunity to help the little girls, he slowly crept around one side of the wooden structure and positioned himself as an observer next to a side window.\" It continued, \"Observing that the first police patrol vehicle to approach the scene was not slowing down to stop, the Amish man quickly withdrew from his hiding place and sprinted towards the roadway to wave down the trooper, who did a fast U-turn and parked. That would be the last successful attempt at an unnoticed move upon the building by anyone.\"[7][8]\nThe first trooper had arrived at approximately 10:42, about six or seven minutes after the 9-1-1 call. The police, while waiting for reinforcements, attempted to communicate with Roberts via the PA system in their patrol cars.[5] They asked Roberts to throw out his weapons and exit the schoolhouse. Roberts refused, demanding that the officers leave.[9] By 11:00\u00a0a.m. a large crowd \u2014 including police officers, emergency medical technicians, and residents of the village \u2014 had assembled both outside the schoolhouse and at a nearby ambulance staging area. County and state police dispatchers had briefly established telephone contact with Roberts as he continued to threaten violence against the children.[8]\nDuring interviews conducted later it became apparent that all of the girls recognized the danger they were in. Some conversed among themselves throughout the ordeal. Shortly before Roberts began shooting, two sisters, Marian and Barbara Fisher, ages 13 and 11, requested that they be shot first, so that the others might be spared. Barbara was wounded, while Marian was killed.[10]\nAt approximately 11:07\u00a0a.m., Roberts began shooting the victims. State troopers immediately approached. As the first trooper in line reached a window, the shooting stopped abruptly; Roberts had committed suicide. During the shooting, he fired at least 13 rounds from his pistol.[11]\n",

The murders believed to be related have occurred in states including Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.[1][2][3] The murders may have continued until 1992.[4][5][6] The victims, many remaining unidentified for years, were usually women with reddish hair, whose bodies were abandoned along major highways in the United States. Officials believe that the women were likely hitchhiking or may have engaged in sex work.[3][7]\nAuthorities are unsure how many people were responsible for these murders, if they were all performed by the same perpetrator(s), and how many victims there have been.[8] It is believed that there may have been a total of five to fourteen victims.[3][9][10] Of the presumed victims, four were identified by November 2018.[11][8][12][13] The suspect was informally called the \"Bible Belt Strangler\" in 2018, because of the territory where the bodies were found.\nOn September 16, 1984, the body of a woman later identified as 28 year old Lisa Nichols, who also used the last name of Jarvis, was found along Interstate 40 near West Memphis, Arkansas. She was wearing only a sweater. She was found to have been a resident of West Virginia. Authorities were not able to identify and contact her family members for some time, indicating that Nichols was estranged from them. She was not identified until June 1985, nine months after she was murdered. She was identified through fingerprints.[14]\nShe was identified by a couple from Florida, who had allowed her to stay with them for a period of time. Nichols may have been murdered after leaving a truck stop along the highway and may have attempted to hitchhike.[8]\nOn January 1, 1985, the bound body of a woman was found near Jellico, Tennessee, in Campbell County, down an embankment off the southbound side of Interstate 75. The remains were in an advanced state of decomposition, as she was killed approximately 72 hours before. The victim was killed by strangulation.[15] She was Caucasian, and had shoulder-length curly red hair. Her age was estimated to be between 17 and 25, but possibly as old as 30.[15] The victim was found clothed, in a tan pullover, a shirt, and jeans. Additionally, she had been wrapped in a blanket, which was later found to have seminal fluid on it.[16] Her eyes were green. The young woman had freckles over her body and various scars (including a burn mark on one arm); she was 10 to 12 weeks pregnant when she died. She had a partial upper denture holding two false teeth.[17]\nIt is believed that she was between five feet one and five\u00a0feet four\u00a0inches (163\u00a0cm) when she died and was approximately 110 to 115 pounds (50 to 52\u00a0kg).[15][17][18]\nOn September 6, 2018, the Shelby County Sheriff's Office announced that the victim had been identified by fingerprint as Tina Marie McKenney Farmer of Indiana. She was 21 or 22 at the time of her death and was last seen in Indianapolis, Indiana, accompanied by a trucker said to be headed to Kentucky.[11][19] Farmer had one daughter prior to disappearing in 1984. She was reported missing by her family at the time, yet authorities in Indiana did not enter her into national databases. The state did not have a law, common to many other states, requiring law enforcement to enter unidentified victims into this database.[20]\nIn 2019, DNA evidence identified convicted kidnapper Jerry Leon Johns as the man that killed Tina Marie McKenney Farmer in December 1984. Johns died in prison in 2015. He was previously convicted in 1987 of aggravated kidnapping, assault, and other crimes in the attack on a woman, Linda Schacke, that he had picked up in Knox County, Tennessee, two months after Farmer's disappearance and death. Schacke survived the attack, after she was bound, strangled, and dumped along I-40. Her testimony assisted in putting Johns behind bars. Like Farmer, Schacke had been choked with a piece of cloth ripped from her T-shirt, bound, and left for dead inside a storm drain under I-40, near Watt Road. Like Farmer, and the other potential victims of the \"Redhead Murders,\" Schacke also had red hair.[21]\nOn December 18, 2019, a grand jury in Campbell County, Tennessee, ruled that Johns would have been indicted for murder in Farmer's death if he were still alive.[22]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn April 4, 2009, a shootout occurred at 1016 Fairfield Street[2] in the Stanton Heights neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, stemming from a mother and her 22-year-old son's argument over a dog urinating in the house.[3] At approximately 7:11\u00a0a.m. EDT, 22-year-old Richard Poplawski opened fire on two Pittsburgh Police officers responding to a 9-1-1 call from Poplawski's mother, who was attempting to get the police officers to remove her son from the home.[3] Despite Poplawski's mother telling the 9-1-1 operator that Poplawski had guns, the police officers were not told.[4]  Three police officers were ultimately confirmed dead, and another two were seriously injured.[5]\nAccording to Pittsburgh Police Chief Nathan Harper, Poplawski was armed with a semi-automatic AK-47-style rifle, a Savage 67 12-gauge shotgun, a .22-caliber Mossberg 702 Plinkster semi-automatic rifle and two handguns (a 4-inch Dan Wesson Model 14 .357 Magnum revolver and a .380-caliber Bersa Thunder 380 handgun), protected by a bulletproof vest, and had been lying in wait for the officers.[5]  According to police and witnesses, he held police at bay for four hours as the fallen officers were left bleeding nearby, their colleagues unable to reach them. More than 600 rounds were fired by the SWAT teams and Poplawski.\nThe victims were the first Pittsburgh city officers killed in the line of duty in 18 years.[5] The incident was the third-deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 attacks, following a 2016 mass shooting in Dallas, Texas;[6][7] and a pair of related shootings two weeks earlier in Oakland, California.[8][9]\nOn June 28, 2011, Poplawski was sentenced to death by lethal injection on three counts of murder in the first degree.[10]\nAt 7:03\u00a0a.m., officers Paul Sciullo and Stephen Mayhle of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police responded to a 9-1-1 call from Poplawski's mother over a domestic disturbance.  When the officers arrived at the scene, the mother answered the door, explaining that she wanted Poplawski out of the house. As the two officers entered the home, Poplawski was reportedly wearing a bulletproof vest and \"lying in wait\". Sciullo was immediately shot in the head. Almost immediately thereafter, Officer Mayhle was also shot in the head.[5]\nOfficer Eric Kelly, on his way home after completing his overnight shift, heard the call for help and arrived at the scene. Poplawski then shot Kelly as he was attempting to aid Sciullo and Mayhle. Officer Timothy McManaway arrived at the scene and was shot in the hand while attempting to pull Kelly to safety, after he saw Kelly wave at him. McManaway sought cover and returned fire. Another officer, Brian Jones, suffered a broken leg when a fence he was climbing collapsed. A short time later, more officers, SWAT team members, and other law enforcement officers arrived and were fired on as well.[5]\nA neighbor who witnessed the incident reported \"They couldn't get the scene secure enough to get to them. They were just lying there bleeding, by the time they secured the scene enough to get to them, it was way too late.\"[5]\nThe standoff with police lasted for approximately four hours. Poplawski's friend Edward Perkovic said he got a call at work from Poplawski during which he said, \"Eddie, I am going to die today. ... Tell your family I love them and I love you.\"  Perkovic said \"I heard gunshots and he hung up. ... He sounded like he was in pain, like he got shot.\"[11]\nAccording to the sources, Poplawski was shot in the leg before surrendering to authorities.[12]\nPoplawski was transported to UPMC Presbyterian after the shooting where he was treated under custody.[13] On April 5, Poplawski was moved from the hospital to the Allegheny County Jail.[14]\n",

        "paragraph": "Jason Keel Sweeney (July 29, 1986 \u2013 May 30, 2003) was a construction worker from Fishtown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who at the age of 16 was murdered by four teenagers for his paycheck on May 30, 2003. The perpetrators included a girl he was dating and his best friend since childhood. Due to the manner in which Sweeney was murdered, the ages of the teens involved, and the seeming indifference of the perpetrators, the crime received national media coverage.[2]\nJason Sweeney left school and was working for his father, a contractor, on a building project in Philadelphia. He recently met a girl he liked, 15-year-old Justina Morley, with whom he had a date on the evening of Friday, May 30, 2003. Unbeknownst to Sweeney, Morley engaged in sexual relations with two other 16-year-olds, Nicholas Coia and Edward Batzig Jr.[3] Batzig was Sweeney's best friend since the fourth grade. Nicholas Coia and his 17-year-old brother, Domenic Coia, were also friends with Sweeney, but the brothers later ended the friendship.[4]\nWith the promise of sex, Morley lured Sweeney to \"The Trails,\" a wooded area of Fishtown near the Delaware River, where Batzig and the Coia brothers were lying in wait. Batzig took the first blow, striking Sweeney in the head four or five times.[5]  Batzig and the Coia brothers then pummeled Sweeney, primarily on his head and face, with a hatchet, a hammer and a rock until he was dead. Batzig later told a detective how he hit Sweeney with the hatchet face four or five times. Batzig said, \"Jason started begging for his life, but we just kept hitting him.\"[6] Batzig also said that Sweeney looked at him during the beating and said, \u201cPlease stop, I'm bleeding,\" after which Batzig hit Sweeney again with the axe.[citation needed] They finished by dropping a boulder on the right side of his head.[7] Sweeney's head was crushed and the only bone left undamaged was his left cheekbone.[8] He was identified by a cut on his hand that he sustained at his construction job.[citation needed]\nFollowing Sweeney's murder, the four assailants stole the $500 cash he earned from work.[7] Before leaving the crime scene, the Coias, Batzig and Morley shared a group hug and split the money, which they used to buy jewelry and illegal drugs\u2014heroin, marijuana, and Xanax\u2014and then \"partied beyond redemption,\" according to Domenic.[6][9]\nDomenic Coia confessed in a court hearing that they were all involved in the murder of Sweeney. The police said the murder was planned days before. Part of the preparation of the murder was listening to the Beatles song \"Helter Skelter\" over forty times, prompting later news coverage to draw a parallel to the Manson family murders.[2][6] Joshua Staab, 18, a friend of Domenic Coia, said that the group bragged about their plan to kill Sweeney by using Justina Morley as \"bait.\" Staab also said that Batzig knew that Sweeney would have his paycheck earnings on him on the day of the murder. The prosecutor asked Staab about the teens' demeanor after the killing. Staab said, \"They seemed pretty fine. In a way, happy.\"[6]\nAlthough all four teens involved in the murder were drug addicts, they were not high before they murdered Sweeney. In response to a detective's question about whether they were high during the killing, Domenic Coia answered, \"No, I was as sober as I am now. It is sick, isn't it?\"[6] A detective involved in the case and a forensic psychologist later opined that the killers' motivation went beyond robbery and stemmed from envy and resentment of Sweeney's relative success in life.[10]\nIn his memoir, Domenic Coia gave a different account of the murder. Domenic claimed he panicked when Batzig actually hit Sweeney and only participated when he feared him and his brother getting caught. He also denies stating he was sober during the attack and states he later prevented them from killing Justina Morley as they feared she would testify. He also denies involvement in any plans for the murder before the day it happened.\nJustina Morley claimed that she started smoking marijuana at the age of 10, and shortly thereafter started taking prescription pills and snorting cocaine. April Frederick, Morley's mother, said her daughter started cutting her wrists at the age of 10. Morley was hospitalized for threatening suicide and self-mutilation in 2002. She was once admitted to Friends Hospital for cutting her wrists, knees and thighs, taking pills and displaying a suicide poem, which she penned on her door. Morley told her mother that she would commit suicide if her mother did not take her out of the hospital; her mother then took her out against the hospital's advice. Morley was expelled from public school in the eighth grade, which she then repeated at the private Holy Name of Jesus Catholic school in Fishtown.\nA psychiatrist hired by the defense team, William Russell, said the reason Morley began sexual activity at an early age \"was an attempt at validation of self-worth\". Morley testified that she had sex with both Nicholas Coia and Batzig in exchange for heroin just a few days before they murdered Sweeney.\nMorley was released on Dec. 20, 2020.\n[11]\n",

He spent several years at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, then taught at several universities in North America, including McGill University in Montreal. He was Professor of Religion at Temple University, where he founded and chaired the Islamic Studies program. Al-Faruqi was also the founder of the International Institute of Islamic Thought. He wrote over 100 articles for various scholarly journals and magazines in addition to 25 books, of the most notable being Christian Ethics: A Historical and Systematic Analysis of Its Dominant Ideas. He also established the Islamic Studies Group of the American Academy of Religion and chaired it for ten years. He served as the vice-president of the Inter-Religious Peace Colloquium, The Muslim-Jewish-Christian Conference and as the president of the American Islamic College in Chicago.\nAl-Faruqi was born in Jaffa, in British-mandate Palestine.[1] His father, 'Abd al-Huda al-Faruqi, was an Islamic judge (qadi) and a religious man well-versed in Islamic scholarship. Faruqi received his religious education at home from his father and in the local mosque. He began to attend the French Dominican Coll\u00e8ge des Fr\u00e8res de Jaffa in 1936.\nHis first appointment was as a registrar of cooperative societies (1942) under the British Mandate government in Jerusalem, which appointed him in 1945 the district governor of Galilee. Subsequent to the partition plan of Palestine, and the creation of the independent Jewish state of Israel in 1948, al-Faruqi at first emigrated to Beirut, Lebanon, where he studied at the American University of Beirut, then enrolled the next year at Indiana University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, obtaining his M.A. in philosophy in 1949. He was then accepted for entry into Harvard University's department of philosophy and was awarded his second M.A. in philosophy there in March 1951, with a thesis entitled Justifying the Good: Metaphysics and Epistemology of Value (1952).\nHis dissertation was deeply influenced by the phenomenology of Max Scheler (1874\u20131928), particularly the latter's notion of axiological intuitionism. Al-Faruqi argued that Scheler's axiological intuitionism privileged feeling as knowing, thus recognizing the logic of the heart as an a priori emotional intuition of value. Such recognition could justify carving out a conceptual as well as practical space for the emergence of a critique of post-Enlightenment Reason from the standpoint of a non-Western philosopher. However, he decided to return to Indiana University; he submitted his thesis to the Department of Philosophy and received his PhD in September 1952. By then he had a background in classical philosophy and the developing thought of the western tradition. At the beginning of 1953, he and his wife were in Syria. He then moved to Egypt, where he studied at Al-Azhar University (1954\u20131958) again with a view to acquiring another PhD.\nIn 1958, al-Faruqi was offered a position as a visiting fellow at the Faculty of Divinity at McGill University in Canada. During his two-year tenure at McGill, he studied Christian theology and Judaism, and became acquainted with the famous Pakistani Muslim philosopher Fazlur Rahman. During these years, al-Faruqi was preoccupied with his anti-Zionist Arab identity. Rahman reminisced in 1986 that al-Faruqi's blunt anti-Zionism and his refusal to play the detached scholar \"frightened\" his McGill colleagues. Although he was soft-spoken with unfailing smiles, at McGill he was considered to be, in Rahman's words, \"an angry young Muslim Palestinian\". In order to challenge al-Faruqi's Arabocentric views of Islam, and to broaden his scope of understanding the ummah, in 1961, Rahman arranged a two-year appointment for him in Pakistan at the Central Institute of Islamic Research. Rahman intended to expose al-Faruqi to the cultural diversity of Muslims and their contributions to Islam. \"Except\", Rahman (1986) later recalled, \"it was his Arabism which drew a great deal of fire both inside and outside the Institute, as well as his academic preference for Cairo\".\nIn 1963, after returning to the United States, he was hired as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago's Divinity School. Between 1964 and 1968, al-Faruqi established himself as an associate professor at the Department of Religion at Syracuse University, where he initiated its programme in Islamic Studies. In 1968, he accepted a position at Temple University as a professor of religion, where he also founded the Islamic Studies Programme. He held that position until his death in 1986.\nMuch of al-Faruqi's early thought is associated with what he called urubah (Arabism). In his 1962 book, On Arabism: Urubah and Religion, he argued that urubah comprises the core identity and set of values which embrace all Muslims, a single community of believers (ummah). Al-Faruqi formulated the notion of urubah in contradistinction to two other hegemonic ideologies: Arab nationalism and non-Arab Islamic revivalism. Adopting an overtly essentialist position, he argued that more than merely the language of the Qur'an, Arabic provided the only possible linguistic structure within which the Islamic conception of the world could be apprehended. Therefore, he asserted that urubah captured the core of Muslim consciousness, its values and faith \u2013 it was inseparable from the identity of all Muslims (al-Faruqi, 1962: 2\u201330).\nHe also maintained that urubah was the only context within which the non-Muslim Arabs countries could integrate into their larger societies. Even non-Muslim Arabs, according to al-Faruqi, could identify with urubah expressed in the Qur'an. In effect, urubah left non-Muslim Arabs and non-Arab Muslims at the mercy of combined linguistic and religious essentialisms. Any other form of consciousness and identity was a distortion created by colonial penetration (al-Faruqi, 1962: 211).\n",

        "paragraph": "On March 1, 2000, a shooting spree took place in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, when 39-year-old Ronald Taylor opened fire on five people within an eight block radius.[2] Three of the five people he shot died while the other two survived. Taylor surrendered to police later that day and was sentenced to death in 2002. The shooting spree was racially motivated, as Taylor, an African American, was known to have been prejudice towards white people; all the victims killed in the shooting were white.[3]\nAt about 9 a.m. on March 1, 2000, two maintenance workers, John Dewitt and 55-year-old John Kroll, arrived at the apartment of 39-year-old Ronald Taylor to replace Taylor's door.[4] When Taylor answered the door, he began taunting both with insults about them being white, according to Dewitt, who claimed Taylor said \"You white, racist, pig\".[5] Nevertheless, the two began work. At around 10:30 a.m., after removing the old door, Dewitt and Kroll started installing the new door, while Taylor continued harassing them. Eventually, Dewitt told Taylor, \"Why don't you just shut up.\" Taylor responded to Dewitt, \"You're dead.\"[5] As the job was almost done, a woman downstairs from Taylor called upstairs and asked if one of the maintenance workers could come and help her with a locked bedroom door. Dewitt said he could and walked downstairs, while Kroll finished the job. Kroll then went downstairs to meet a coworker named Andrew Williams.\nAt just about 11:15 a.m, Taylor grabbed his .22 caliber revolver and set his apartment couch on fire.[5] Armed with the gun, he confronted Kroll and Williams downstairs and reportedly told them \"I don't like white people\", then proceeded to shoot Kroll in the neck.[5] Williams rushed to Kroll's side while Taylor decided not to shoot Williams, likely because Williams was black, but instead demanded to know where Dewitt was. Dewitt, who was in the parking lot putting tools away, walked back into the building to get Kroll when he noticed Taylor with a gun, so he took cover.[5] Minutes later, he saw Williams covered in blood walking with Kroll in his arms, and as Taylor was not in sight, he rushed over to Williams and asked what was going on.\nWilliams told Dewitt that Taylor shot Kroll and was looking for him.[5] The two then put Kroll in the back of the employee pickup truck and drove to the Western Pennsylvania Hospital. Police and firefighters were contacted and rushed to Taylor's apartment, but by that time, Taylor had fled.[5] About five minutes later Taylor walked two blocks  to Burger King at Penn and Pitt avenues, where he fatally shot 71-year-old former priest Joseph Healy.[4] Shortly afterwards, Taylor approached a McDonald's, and shot multiple times at the van belonging to 56-year-old Richard Clinger.[5] Some shots hit Clinger, and his stepdaughter Cindy Zambo ran to a nearby Dunkin' Donuts where she alerted people there about her dad being shot. Meanwhile, Taylor entered the McDonald's and shot the manager, 25-year-old Steven Bostard.[5] Taylor then returned to the parking lot and shot 20-year-old Emil Sanielevici, who was waiting to pick up food. Sanielevici later died, while Clinger and Bostard survived after being treated at the UPMC.[6] At 11:51 a.m., Kroll, who was awaiting surgery, died from his bullet wound.[5]\nAt around 12:00 p.m., police cornered Taylor at a residential building, where Taylor took refuge in an empty room.[5] Sgt. John Fisher began communicating with Taylor and begged him to surrender. Taylor told the officer that he was going to commit suicide because he did not want his mother to see him in jail.[7] After two hours, Fisher was able to convince Taylor to surrender, and at around 2:15 p.m., Taylor handed over his gun and was arrested.[5]\n[6]\nRonald Taylor (born September 30, 1960),[8] the shooter, had no prior criminal record.[9] Taylor grew up in the predominantly African-American Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[10] When he was young, he was diagnosed with asthma.[10] He attended Fifth Avenue High School until it closed in 1976; afterwards he attended Letsche Education Center.[11] At the time of the shooting spree, Taylor lived in the Woodside Garden Apartments and was unemployed,[12] living on Supplemental Security Income and food stamp benefits which totaled between $600 and $700 a month.[10]\nIn a search of Taylor's apartment police found writings that signified Taylor's anti-white beliefs.[13] There were also anti-semitic writings with excerpts such as \"big thumbs up to Hitler\".[14] Taylor had written a suicide note which investigators found after the shooting. The note read as follows;\nFriends of Taylor reported that they were \"stunned\" to hear that Taylor had committed the shootings. David Ellis, an acquaintance of Taylor, said that Taylor \"never caused any trouble I knew of\". They also reported to be \"shocked\" about the accusations of Taylor being racist.[10] Neighbors of Taylor described him as \"quiet\" and someone who \"didn't start any trouble\".[16] Taylor rarely met with his family members and spent a large amount of time in isolation.[17] Taylor did have a history of mental illness and one professional, Dr. Horacio Fabrega, who would testify for Taylor's defense, described Taylor as \"delusional\".[18] Fabrega also said that Taylor had once burned an image of Jesus Christ under the belief that God \"turned bad\".[19] Taylor had stolen the revolver he used in the shootings from his mother, who had purchased it in 1982.[20]\n",

        "paragraph": "The 1877 Shamokin uprising occurred in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, in July 1877, as one of the several cities in the state where strikes occurred as part of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. The Great Strike  was the first in the United States in which workers across the country united in an action against major companies. In many cities, the railroad workers were joined by other industrial workers in general strikes.\nRailroad workers and miners had perilous jobs in the late 19th century. More than 200 railroad workers and 1000 miners died in accidents every year. The companies often forced both groups to buy goods from company stores at inflated prices and work from sunup to sundown. Companies made engineers pay for all train damages, regardless of fault. Children tore their hands picking rocks from coal in collieries.\nThe first recorded strike in the anthracite coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania occurred in 1842. More followed in 1849, 1869, and 1872. During the Civil War, the mine owners used cavalry platoons to arrest eight miners and evict them from company homes for striking in Locust Gap. At that time, the workers in Locust Gap formed the Miner's Benevolent Society, to provide accident insurance and demand better pay. It was one of the first unions in America.\nThe Workers' Benevolent Association, founded in St Clair in 1868, expanded to Northumberland County, including Locust Gap, on October 19, 1869. It built on the efforts of previous unions like the Miners Benevolent Society. It continued as one of the early ways that workers organized for mutual benefit.\nBy 1872 the Reading Railroad was the biggest mine company in the anthracite region. It used its monopoly on the railroads to take over 70,000 acres (280\u00a0km2) of the best coal lands. The company's president was Frank Gowen. Gowen Street in Shamokin and even Gowen City were named after him. Gowen established a private police force, called the \"Reading Coal and Iron Police.\" Between 1871 and 1875 Gowen borrowed $69 million to pay for his empire. But he and the other railroad barons had overestimated the demand for train service and over-invested. Debts forced them to fire many workers, resulting in a nationwide depression in the Panic of 1873.\nIn 1874 a third of Pennsylvania's workforce was unemployed. The Reading Railroad cut train workers' wages by 10%, resulting in an unsuccessful strike. In 1875 only 1/5 of American workers had full-time jobs. Some people vented their frustration by damaging tracks, trains, and mines. On May 11, 1875, the trestle at Locust Gap Junction was exploded. It is believed to have been a protest by unemployed men. The telegraph office at Locust Summit was burned. From 1860 to 1909 arson destroyed 25 collieries between Mount Carmel and Trevorton. Knoebels Amusement Resort has a Mining Museum with a mural of the twice-burned Locust Gap colliery.\nThe July 1875 Officers of the Miners' and Laborers' Benevolent Association for Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, included: Pres. John N. Evans Mt. Carmel; VP Dennis Coming Locust Gap; Sec. Ben Ressler, Excelsior; Treas. John L. Shanahan, Mt. Carmel.\nIn the Mt. Carmel District the following officers were elected: Pres. Lewis Dietrich; VP Pat Donnal; Sec. John L. Shanahan; Treas. Julius Maure; Trustees Patrick Donlan, Patrick Nowlan, and Thomas Perry.\nWhen Gowen lowered mining wages to 54% of their 1869 level, miners began the \"Long Strike\" of 1875. It started in January 1875 and lasted 170 days. But Gowen stored enough coal to outlast the strike and crushed the miner's union by firing its members.\nIn July 1875, Gowen presented \"A List of Outrages in the Schuylkill and Shamokin Regions\" to Pennsylvania's legislature, including:\n",

        "paragraph": "There were a number of race riots in Philadelphia during the 1919 Red Summer.\nAs more and more African-Americans moved from the south to the industrial north, they started to move into predominantly white neighborhoods. In 1918, for four days starting July 25, there was a race riot in Chester and Philadelphia.[1] When things finally settled down, 3 black and 2 white people had died from their injuries.[2]\nIn Philadelphia, the black migration created very high tensions in the area surrounding Twenty-fifth and Pine streets. Making things worse, a local gang had been terrorizing the new black tenants. On May 9, a large mob of white people clashed with a large black group. The mob then broke open the door at 2535 Pine street and tried to\neject George Grahm and his black family who had moved there a week earlier. A number of people were later arrested.[3]\nThe New York Times wrote an article that described two riots during the Red Summer, one on July 7 and 31.[4] Authors Rucker & Upton talk about during a carnival, a large group of whites fought a group of blacks. The violence was quickly suppressed when over 100 police showed up and made arrests.[5]\nThis uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that took place during the so-called Red Summer of 1919. The Summer consisted of terrorist attacks on black communities, and white oppression, in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African-American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Massacre in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also occurring in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively, with both events having many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching millions of dollars.[4]\nNotes\nReferences\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJennifer Lee Daugherty (November 8, 1979\u00a0\u2013 February 11, 2010) was an American woman who was torture-murdered in Greensburg, Pennsylvania as an act of revenge in February 2010. Daugherty, who was mentally disabled, was tortured and murdered before being wrapped in Christmas decorations, put inside a garbage can, and dumped in the parking lot of Greensburg-Salem Middle School.\nAmber Meidinger met Melvin Knight at a homeless shelter in Washington in January 2010. They moved to several locations before settling in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where they met Jennifer Daugherty.[1] Knight met Ricky Smyrnes after meeting previously in jail.[2]\nMelvin L. Knight (born October 27, 1989)[3] was born to a drug-addicted father who was imprisoned during the early years of his life. He developed lifelong learning and social problems after he fell out of a moving vehicle and hit his head at age 5.[4]\nAngela Lynn Marinucci (born July 14, 1992),[3] according to testimony by her mother and half-sister, Marinucci suffered a head injury when she was hit by a truck in 2008, at the age of 15. The injury substantially altered her behavior and pushed her into a downward spiral that ended with Daugherty\u2019s death, according to the defense. Two mental experts testified that Marinucci as a child, suffered from depression and that she may have had drug and alcohol addictions as a teenager.[5]\nMeidinger told jurors, \"at some point, she [Daugherty] trusted me because she knew me from the West Place (a center for people with special needs).\" Meidinger testified she and her then-boyfriend and co-defendant Melvin Knight met Smyrnes on February 8, 2010, after she and Knight had been staying at a Greensburg-area hotel. Knight and Smyrnes knew each other after meeting in jail, and Meidinger was pregnant with Knight's child when all three met up. Smyrnes offered Meidinger and Knight to stay at his apartment at 428 N. Pennsylvania Avenue in Greensburg.[6]\nRicky Ven Edward Smyrnes (born March 6, 1986)[3] was born to a drug-addicted Philadelphia sex worker and a Pittsburgh gang member. He was moved into and out of foster homes as a child and was treated for mental health disorders as early as age 4. He suffered abuse and neglect until he was taken in by the Smyrnes family in North Huntingdon at age 10, according to testimony by forensic psychologist Alice Applegate.[7] His lawyer, Terri Fayes, told the jury that Smyrnes suffered sexual and physical abuse from his father and his uncle. She also explained how he had tried beer, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana by age 6, had been diagnosed with PTSD at age 8, and had undergone 103 therapy sessions by age 10. She added he was diagnosed as having as many as seven different personalities, and 15 total psychiatric issues. In 1997, he burglarized his neighbor's home and stole knives, guitars, coins, bullets, and cash. That same year, he sexually assaulted a woman in her basement.[8]\nAccording to a testimony by Meidinger, the group went through her purse and stole money, gift cards, and her cell phone. They poured liquids into her bag, hit her head with filled soda bottles, cut her hair, painted her face with nail polish, and dumped liquid and spices on her head. Meidinger said she and Angela Marinucci took turns violently hitting Daugherty with a metal towel rack and crutches. She also noted that Daugherty was stripped naked, gagged, and raped by Knight.[1] They also forced her to consume feces, urine, and detergent.[9][10] Meidinger also said Knight took Daugherty to the living room where Marinucci poured a bottle of water over Daugherty's head and Knight and Smyrnes dumped oatmeal and spices on her head. Daugherty said that her eyes were burning, and Smyrnes told her to take a shower because she smelled bad.[2]\nAccording to her relatives, Daugherty had the mental abilities of an adolescent, trusted everyone, and thought that the suspects were her \"friends.\"[11]\n",

The police had been responding to a report about Hall, who was suspected to be suicidal and found with a firearm.[1] Though he appeared to surrender, Hall was shot after allegedly again picking the gun up from the ground after commands not to, then raising his arms while holding the gun.[2]\nHall was born Chen Zhi Bo on October 31, 2001, in Shanghai, Mainland China. Shortly after his first birthday, he was adopted by Gareth J. Hall and Fe Hall, who are of African-American and Asian-American descent respectively. He had his name officially changed to Christian Joseph Hall.[3]\nOn December 30, 2020, police arrived on the Pennsylvania Route 33 overpass above Interstate 80 responding to a call about a distraught man, later identified as Hall. Footage of the scene showed him pacing around and clutching what appears to be a gun.[4] Initial reports said Hall placed it on the ground after being ordered to do so, and began negotiating with the officers, but soon picked it up again.[5] Around 1:38 p.m., Hall was shot seven times by the troopers.[1][6] Hall was carrying a pellet gun and allegedly picked it back up from the ground, after commands issued by the police. Hall, while still possessing the gun, began to raise his arms and hands when he was shot.[2] He was taken to the Lehigh Valley Hospital-Pocono in East Stroudsburg, where he later died from his injuries.[1][4]\nInitial reports from authorities stated that when the officers told Hall to put the gun on the ground, he complied, but at one point during negotiations, he picked up the gun and pointed it in the direction of the police, causing them to shoot him.[7] A video of the incident with evidence contradicting the claims surfaced in February 2021. The video shows Hall raising his hands before he is shot and falls.[6]\nHall's adoptive parents reported that he had been experiencing a mental health problem. Fe Hall told WNEP-TV, \"He needed help. He was looking for help, but instead of getting help, he was killed in cold blood by those who were supposed to help him.\" Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump also stated that Hall was in need of help and seemed to be contemplating suicide.[7]\nHall's family started a petition to reopen the investigation of his shooting, with a goal of 150,000 votes.[6] On February 12, 2021, his death was protested by people outside the Philadelphia City Hall.[8] Twitter users have demanded #JusticeforChristian after the video of the incident emerged.[9]\nIn March 2021, Michael Mancuso, an assistant district attorney, called Hall's death a \"classic suicide by cop scenario\" at a news conference.[2]\nIn November 2021, a new video was released which shows Hall holding the pellet gun with his hands raised at the time of his killing.[2] The video is unblurred, unlike video previously released by the Monroe County district attorney, and was obtained through subpoena by a lawyer representing Hall's parents.\n",

In 1973, he was convicted in connection with the 1970 murder of Philadelphia (PA) police  officer Frank Von Colln.[1]\nIn August 1970, Philadelphia Police Sergeant Frank Von Colln (aged 43 and a father of two) was ambushed and murdered while talking on the phone in the Cobbs Creek guard house at the corner of 63rd and Catherine streets in Philadelphia.[2] Von Colln was shot five times by members of a group known as the Revolutionaries after he had just dispatched two officers to investigate the shooting of another officer by members of the same group.[3] Two other officers were shot and wounded in the same 24-hour period.[4]\nIn January 1972, Russell Shoatz was arrested and charged in connection with Von Colln\u2019s murder.[5] In 1973, after a trial by jury, Shoatz was convicted of first degree murder, assault and battery with intent to murder, aggravated robbery and conspiracy.[6]  He was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.[7] Four other suspects were also charged, convicted and sentenced to life in prison in connection with the murder of Von Colln.[8]  In 1996 a sixth suspect was apprehended in Chicago and also charged, but was acquitted in 1999.[9]\nShoatz began serving his life sentence in 1973.  In September 1977, Shoatz and several other inmates took over a cell block at Huntingdon State Correctional.[10]\nShoatz injured several guards with a knife, and, along with three other prisoners, attempted to escape from the prison. Two of the inmates were captured immediately and a third was killed during the escape. Shoatz remained at large until he was captured in October 1977.[11] Relocated to Fairview, a maximum security institution in Waymart, Pennsylvania, in 1980 Shoatz again escaped after another prisoner smuggled in a revolver and sub-machine gun. Three days later, a shoot out with state authorities ended in his capture.[12]\nIn June 1991, Shoatz was transferred to solitary confinement where he was held for more than 22 consecutive years until February 20, 2014, when he was returned to the prison's general population.[13]\nThe last dismissal of his legal counsel's appeal for his return to the regular prison population highlighted the fulcrum of the controversy:\nIn the volatile atmosphere of a prison, an inmate easily may constitute an unacceptable threat to the safety of other prisoners and guards even if he himself has committed no misconduct; rumor, reputation, and even more imponderable factors may suffice to spark potentially disastrous incidents. The judgment of prison officials in this context, like that of those making parole decisions, turns largely on purely subjective evaluations and on predictions of future behavior.[14]Shoatz was granted compassionate release on October 26, 2021, after suffering from advanced colorectal cancer. He died less than two months later, on December 17, at the age of 78.[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "Philip Charles Testa (April 21, 1924 \u2013 March 15, 1981), also known as \"The Chicken Man\", was an Italian-American mobster known for his brief leadership of the Philadelphia crime family of the Italian-American Mafia. He became boss of the Philadelphia crime family after the previous boss and his close friend, Angelo Bruno, was murdered by Bruno\u2019s own consigliere, Antonio Caponigro, who, in turn, was ordered killed by The Commission for murdering a boss without permission. Testa's nickname came from his involvement in a poultry business. About a year after Bruno's death, Testa was killed by the blast of a nail bomb at his home in South Philadelphia. The assassination was allegedly ordered by Testa\u2019s own underboss, Peter Casella, as part of the first Philadelphia Mafia War.\nTesta was born to Sicilian immigrants in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and lived in South Philadelphia with his family in his teenage years. In South Philadelphia he met and befriended future mob boss Angelo Bruno. He later married Alfia Arcidiacono (records show her family owned a farm in Salem County, New Jersey). In early police dossiers on Testa, he was identified by law enforcement as not having a legitimate source of income and was solely dependent from winnings as a \"common gambler.\"\nTesta and his wife had a son who also became involved in organized crime, Salvatore Testa, and was killed three years after his father.[1]\nIn 1970, Testa became underboss of Angelo Bruno. When Bruno was murdered in 1980, Testa became boss, appointing Nicodemo Scarfo as consigliere.\nOne month before Testa was murdered, he, Frank Narducci Sr., Harold and Mario Riccobene, Pasquale Spirito, Joseph Ciancaglini, and several associates were indicted in a federal racketeering case that centered on gambling and loansharking operations run by the mob. The case was based on an investigation called Operation Gangplank and was one of the first built on the RICO Act by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Philadelphia. On March 15, 1981, Testa returned to his home in South Philadelphia that was across the street from Stephen Girard Park. As he was opening the door to his twin home at 2117 Porter Street, a nail bomb exploded under his front porch.[2] His death was allegedly ordered by his underboss and drug trafficker Peter Casella and capo Frank Narducci Sr., which later resulted in Narducci being gunned down and Casella being banished from the Mob and fleeing to Florida.\nTesta's murder sparked a war within the family. Nicodemo Scarfo seized the top position for himself, promoting his long time friend Chuckie Merlino as his underboss and Testa loyalist Frank Monte as his consigliere.[3][4] Scarfo would go on to lead the family for a decade with a bloody rampage, fueled by paranoia and aggression.[5]\nTesta's violent death is referenced in the opening lines of musician Bruce Springsteen's song \"Atlantic City\".[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Philadelphia race riot, or Columbia Avenue Riot, took place in the predominantly black neighborhoods of North Philadelphia from August 28 to August 30, 1964. Tensions between black residents of the city and police had been escalating for several months over several well-publicized allegations of police brutality.[1]\nThis riot was one of the first in the civil rights era and followed the 1964 Rochester race riot and Harlem riot of 1964 in New York City.\nIn 1964, North Philadelphia was the city's center of African-American culture, and home to 400,000 of the city's 600,000 black residents.[2] The Philadelphia Police Department had tried to improve its relationship with the city's black community, assigning police to patrol black neighborhoods in teams of one black and one white officer per squad car and having a civilian review board to handle cases of police brutality.[2]\nDespite the improvement attempts of the Philadelphia Police Department, racial tensions had been high in Philadelphia over the issue of police brutality. The Philadelphia Tribune, the city\u2019s black newspaper, ran several articles on police brutality which often resulted in white policemen being brought up on charges of brutality, only to be later acquitted.[3] The summer of 1964 was at the peak of the civil rights movement with rioting breaking out in black areas of other northern cities including New York City; Rochester, NY; Jersey City, NJ and Elizabeth, NJ stemming from allegations of police brutality against black residents.[2]\nThe unrest began on the evening of August 28 after a black woman named Odessa Bradford got into an argument with two police officers, one black, Robert Wells, and the other white, John Hoff, because Bradford stopped the car while arguing with her boyfriend and refused to move out of the intersection at 23rd Street and Columbia Avenue.[3]  The officers then tried to physically remove Bradford from the car. As the argument went on, a large crowd assembled in the area. A man tried to come to Bradford's aid by attacking the police officers at the scene, both he and Bradford were arrested.\nRumors then spread throughout North Philadelphia that a pregnant black woman had been beaten to death by white police officers. Later that evening, and throughout the next two days, angry mobs looted and burned mostly white-owned businesses in North Philadelphia, mainly along Columbia Avenue.  Outnumbered, the police response was to withdraw from the area rather than aggressively confront the rioters.\nAlthough no one was killed, 341 people were injured, 774 people were arrested and 225 stores were damaged or destroyed in the three days of rioting.  Some of the tension was attributable to religion, with Black Muslims and black nationalists pitted against Black Baptist ministers who called for calm.[4]\nThe riot was reported to have caused 4 million dollars worth of damages.[5] Business activity in North Philadelphia declined even further after the riots, as many of the damaged or destroyed stores never re-opened for business. The riots also helped to facilitate the political rise to power of Frank Rizzo,[6] who favored more punitive approaches to crime.\nIn 1987, Columbia Avenue between Front and 33rd Streets was renamed Cecil B. Moore Avenue after the influential and often controversial Civil Rights leader.[7] Although his role was limited, Moore has been regarded as a pacifying figure who helped quell the rioting. While present-day Cecil B. Moore Avenue is still largely impoverished, it has witnessed redevelopment, including expansion of the Temple University campus, such that the area around Broad Street is much more integrated with a predominantly educated population.\n",

The perpetrators included a girl he was dating and his best friend since childhood. Due to the manner in which Sweeney was murdered, the ages of the teens involved, and the seeming indifference of the perpetrators, the crime received national media coverage.[2]\nJason Sweeney left school and was working for his father, a contractor, on a building project in Philadelphia. He recently met a girl he liked, 15-year-old Justina Morley, with whom he had a date on the evening of Friday, May 30, 2003. Unbeknownst to Sweeney, Morley engaged in sexual relations with two other 16-year-olds, Nicholas Coia and Edward Batzig Jr.[3] Batzig was Sweeney's best friend since the fourth grade. Nicholas Coia and his 17-year-old brother, Domenic Coia, were also friends with Sweeney, but the brothers later ended the friendship.[4]\nWith the promise of sex, Morley lured Sweeney to \"The Trails,\" a wooded area of Fishtown near the Delaware River, where Batzig and the Coia brothers were lying in wait. Batzig took the first blow, striking Sweeney in the head four or five times.[5]  Batzig and the Coia brothers then pummeled Sweeney, primarily on his head and face, with a hatchet, a hammer and a rock until he was dead. Batzig later told a detective how he hit Sweeney with the hatchet face four or five times. Batzig said, \"Jason started begging for his life, but we just kept hitting him.\"[6] Batzig also said that Sweeney looked at him during the beating and said, \u201cPlease stop, I'm bleeding,\" after which Batzig hit Sweeney again with the axe.[citation needed] They finished by dropping a boulder on the right side of his head.[7] Sweeney's head was crushed and the only bone left undamaged was his left cheekbone.[8] He was identified by a cut on his hand that he sustained at his construction job.[citation needed]\nFollowing Sweeney's murder, the four assailants stole the $500 cash he earned from work.[7] Before leaving the crime scene, the Coias, Batzig and Morley shared a group hug and split the money, which they used to buy jewelry and illegal drugs\u2014heroin, marijuana, and Xanax\u2014and then \"partied beyond redemption,\" according to Domenic.[6][9]\nDomenic Coia confessed in a court hearing that they were all involved in the murder of Sweeney. The police said the murder was planned days before. Part of the preparation of the murder was listening to the Beatles song \"Helter Skelter\" over forty times, prompting later news coverage to draw a parallel to the Manson family murders.[2][6] Joshua Staab, 18, a friend of Domenic Coia, said that the group bragged about their plan to kill Sweeney by using Justina Morley as \"bait.\" Staab also said that Batzig knew that Sweeney would have his paycheck earnings on him on the day of the murder. The prosecutor asked Staab about the teens' demeanor after the killing. Staab said, \"They seemed pretty fine. In a way, happy.\"[6]\nAlthough all four teens involved in the murder were drug addicts, they were not high before they murdered Sweeney. In response to a detective's question about whether they were high during the killing, Domenic Coia answered, \"No, I was as sober as I am now. It is sick, isn't it?\"[6] A detective involved in the case and a forensic psychologist later opined that the killers' motivation went beyond robbery and stemmed from envy and resentment of Sweeney's relative success in life.[10]\nIn his memoir, Domenic Coia gave a different account of the murder. Domenic claimed he panicked when Batzig actually hit Sweeney and only participated when he feared him and his brother getting caught. He also denies stating he was sober during the attack and states he later prevented them from killing Justina Morley as they feared she would testify. He also denies involvement in any plans for the murder before the day it happened.\nJustina Morley claimed that she started smoking marijuana at the age of 10, and shortly thereafter started taking prescription pills and snorting cocaine. April Frederick, Morley's mother, said her daughter started cutting her wrists at the age of 10. Morley was hospitalized for threatening suicide and self-mutilation in 2002. She was once admitted to Friends Hospital for cutting her wrists, knees and thighs, taking pills and displaying a suicide poem, which she penned on her door. Morley told her mother that she would commit suicide if her mother did not take her out of the hospital; her mother then took her out against the hospital's advice. Morley was expelled from public school in the eighth grade, which she then repeated at the private Holy Name of Jesus Catholic school in Fishtown.\nA psychiatrist hired by the defense team, William Russell, said the reason Morley began sexual activity at an early age \"was an attempt at validation of self-worth\". Morley testified that she had sex with both Nicholas Coia and Batzig in exchange for heroin just a few days before they murdered Sweeney.\nMorley was released on Dec. 20, 2020.\n[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nMonroe Heath\n\nThe Great Railroad Strike of 1877, sometimes referred to as the Great Upheaval, began on July 14 in Martinsburg, West Virginia,  after the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) cut wages for the third time in a year. This strike finally ended 52 days later, after it was put down by unofficial militias, the National Guard, and federal troops.  Because of economic problems and pressure on wages by the railroads, workers in numerous other cities, in New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland, into Illinois and Missouri, also went out on strike. An estimated 100 people were killed in the unrest across the country. In Martinsburg, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and other cities, workers burned down and destroyed both physical facilities and the rolling stock of the railroads\u2014engines and railroad cars. Local populations feared that workers were rising in revolution such as the Paris Commune of 1871.[citation needed]\nAt the time, the workers were not represented by trade unions. The city and state governments were aided by unofficial militias, the National Guard, federal troops and private militias organized by the railroads, who all fought against the workers. Disruption was widespread and at its height, the strikes were supported by about 100,000 workers. With the intervention of federal troops in several locations, most of the strikes were suppressed by early August. Labor continued to work to organize into unions to work for better wages and conditions. Fearing the social disruption, many cities built armories to support the local National Guard units; these defensive buildings still stand as symbols of the effort to suppress the labor unrest of this period.[citation needed]\nWith public attention on workers' wages and conditions, the B&O in 1880 founded an Employee Relief Association to provide death benefits and some health care. In 1884, it established a worker pension plan. Other improvements were implemented later.\nThe Long Depression, beginning in the United States with the financial  Panic of 1873 and lasting 65 months, became the longest economic contraction in American history, including the later more famous, 45-month-long Great Depression of the 1930s.[1][2] The failure of the Jay Cooke bank in New York, was followed quickly by that of Henry Clews, and set off a chain reaction of bank failures, temporarily closing the New York stock market.[3]:\u200a65\u200a\nUnemployment rose dramatically, reaching 14 percent by 1876, many more were severely underemployed, and  wages overall dropped to 45% of their previous level.[4] Thousands of American businesses failed, defaulting on more than a billion dollars of debt.[5] One in four laborers in New York were out of work in the winter of 1873-1874.[5]:\u200a167\u200a National construction of new rail lines dropped from 7,500 miles of track in 1872 to just 1,600 miles in 1875,[6] and production in iron and steel alone dropped as much as 45%.[7][5]:\u200a167\u200a\nWhen the Civil War ended, a boom in railroad construction ensued, with roughly 35,000 miles (55,000 kilometers) of new track being laid from coast to coast between 1866 and 1873. The railroads, then the second-largest employer outside of agriculture, required large amounts of capital investment, and thus entailed massive financial risk. Speculators fed large amounts of money into the industry, causing abnormal growth and over-expansion. Jay Cooke's firm, like many other banking firms, invested a disproportionate share of depositors' funds in the railroads, thus laying the track for the ensuing collapse.[citation needed]\n",

His work is held in numerous public collections.\nRobert Carpenter Spencer was born on 1 December 1879 in Harvard, Nebraska, son of Solomon Hogue Spencer, a Swedenborgian clergyman and a distant descendant of the English noble Spencer family.[1] His mother was Frances Strickler Spencer, daughter of a buggy manufacturer.\nHis father left the church to teach for a few years while his two children were infants. He returned to the ministry in 1884. \nHe co-founded, published and edited The New Christianity, a Swedenborgian journal. \nThe family moved often. They lived in Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia and then Yonkers, New York, where Robert Spencer graduated from high school in 1899.[2]\nSpencer had planned to study medicine, but instead in 1899 began to study art at the National Academy of Design in New York City. He met and befriended the painter Charles Rosen while at the academy.[3]\nFrom 1903 to 1905 he studied under William Merritt Chase at his New York School of Art, and probably studied under Robert Henri.\nHe spent about a year working for a civil engineering company as a draftsman and surveyor.[4]\nHis father died in 1906.[2]\nIn 1906 Spencer moved to the Bucks County area, where Charles Rosen had settled three years earlier.\nFor the next few years he lived in various small towns on the Delaware River.[3]\nThese included Frenchtown, New Jersey and Point Pleasant, Pennsylvania.[5]\nDuring this period he studied with Daniel Garber, who strongly influenced his style.[3]\nFor a few years Spencer and an artist friend Charles Frederic Ramsey lived in poverty in an extremely dilapidated old house called the Huffnagle Mansion.[a][3]\nThey paid a nominal rent of $2 per month. The house had peeling plaster and little in the way of heating. The lavatory was an outhouse.\nSpencer was very productive during this period, and won awards at the National Academy of Art and Design and the Art Club of Philadelphia.[3]\nSpencer studied with the established landscape painter William Lathrop. \nIn 1913 he met Margaret Alexina Harrison Fulton (born 1882), a fellow student of Lathrop who was an architect as well as a painter.[6]\nMargaret was from a wealthy Philadelphia family.[7]\nShe was the niece of the painters Alexander and Birge Harrison.  They married in 1914.[4]\nThey moved first into an apartment and then into a new house.[7]\nSpencer became an Associate of the National Academy of Design in 1914.[8]\nIn 1916 Spencer, Rae Sloan Bredin, Charles Rosen, Morgan Colt, Daniel Garber and William Langson Lathrop formed The New Hope Group to arrange for exhibitions of their work.[9][10]\nIn the 1920s Spencer began painting landscapes of the Delaware River valley. \nHe experienced a series of nervous breakdowns in the years that followed.[4]\nHis marriage became unhappy.[7]\nIn the summer of 1925 he visited Spain, France and Italy.\nHe returned to Europe on 1927 and spent several months in Paris.[11]\nHe started painting imaginary scenes with European settings.\nOn July 11, 1931, Spencer committed suicide with a handgun in his studio.[4][11]\nHe left two daughters.[12]\nSpencer is known for his paintings of figures against a backdrop of factories and apartment houses, in an impressionist style with short, tight brushstrokes.\nThe paintings he made in 1909\u201310 of the Pennsylvania mills and the women mill workers are considered his best.[4]\nHe said, \"A landscape without a building or a figure is a very lonely picture to me.\"[12]\nWell known works include The Silk Mill (1912), Grey Mills (1913), The Closing Hour (1913) and Repairing the Bridge (1913). \nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art bought Repairing the Bridge in 1914.[3]\nHis painting On the Canal, New Hope was acquired in 1916 by the Detroit Museum of Art.\nIt depicts the back of run-down houses on the canal, with the lower portions whitewashed and bathed in light, with women doing housework.[13]\nA contemporary critic wrote, \"Interpreted thro' the temperament of Robert Spencer a squalid motive which most of us would pass daily and regard as hopelessly commonplace is presented in a way to stir our emotions and without losing anything of its truth...\"[13]\nPierre Bonnard said in 1926 \"Mr. Spencer . . . is in the full vigor of his talent, which is great. His art does not resemble European art, a rare fact in America.\"\nAccording to the art collector Duncan Phillips he was\"a rebel always against the standardized and stereotyped in art... [there was] no other painter, not John Sloan, or Edward Hopper, more pungently American in expression.\"[12]\nSpencer exhibited widely in the United States and abroad.\nInstitutions that hold his work include the Art Institute of Chicago, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the James A. Michener Art Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, the Berkshire Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Academy of Design, The Reading Public Museum, the Detroit Institute of Fine Arts, the National Arts Club, the Delaware Art Museum, the Widener University Art Museum[14] and The Phillips Collection in Washington D.C.[5]\n",

The case led to a critical overview of Newfoundland's legal and child welfare systems as well as Canada's bail laws.\nA 2006 inquiry found serious shortcomings in how the province's social services system handled the case, suggesting that the judges, prosecutors, and child welfare agencies involved were more concerned with presuming Shirley's innocence than with protecting Zachary Turner. The inquiry concluded that Zachary's death had been preventable.[4] The case led to the passage of Bill C-464, or Zachary's Bill, strengthening the conditions for bail in Canadian courts in cases involving the well-being of children.\nThe deaths of Andrew Bagby and Zachary Turner became the basis for the 2008 documentary film Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father, directed by Kurt Kuenne.[5]\nShirley Jane Turner (28 January 1961 \u2013 18 August 2003) was a Canadian-American daughter of a U.S. serviceman and local woman from St. Anthony, Newfoundland. She was raised with three siblings in Wichita, Kansas, but moved to Newfoundland with her mother after her parents separated. Her parents later divorced.[2]:\u200a80\u200a In 1980, Turner enrolled at Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John's, seeking to embark on a medical career.[2]:\u200a84\u200a\nUpon becoming pregnant, Turner married a long-time boyfriend during Memorial University's 1981 winter recess. The child, a boy, was born on 9 July 1982. Turner's husband raised the child as a stay-at-home dad while Turner continued her studies. In 1983, Turner moved to Labrador City and worked as a science teacher. Two years later, she gave birth to a daughter.[2]:\u200a85\u200a During this period, she resumed a previous relationship with a fisherman from Corner Brook.[2]:\u200a86\u200a\nFollowing the end of her first marriage on 29 January 1988, Turner married her boyfriend from Corner Brook the following July.[2]:\u200a87\u200a Turner also had an abortion that July, but the father was not known.[6] Turner gave birth to her second daughter on 8 March 1990, one year before she and her second husband separated. Turner completed her undergraduate education while raising her children with help from her second husband.\nIn October 1993, a man boarding with Turner confided to his therapist that he had witnessed Turner physically and emotionally abusing two of her children. Newfoundland social service workers interviewed the children, who stated that their \"disciplinarian\" mother punished them with spankings and beatings by belt. Turner's second husband claimed that she only used the belt as a threat in his interview. The case was closed on 11 January 1994 without an interview with Turner. Three years later, Turner and her second husband divorced, and she was granted custody of their daughter. Within days of the ruling, however, Turner sent her daughter back to live with her father in Portland Creek while her other two children were sent to Parson's Pond to live with their paternal grandmother.\nSince 1982, Turner had taken out baby bonuses for her children from a scholarship fund with the expectation of sending them to university. However, in the summer of 2000, Turner confessed to a relative that she had spent the baby bonuses on her own living expenses as well as her doctoral education. Turner insisted that she would earn \"big money\" after completing her post-residency training and would repay the savings for her children's post-secondary education.\n",

Baumhammers was the second child to Andrejs and Inese; his older sister Daina was born in 1963.[1] The family settled in the Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon.[3] Baumhammers was a second-string kicker on the Mt. Lebanon High School football team.[1]\nAfter completing high school in 1983, Baumhammers graduated from Kent State University in Ohio in 1989 and began law school at Cumberland Law School in Birmingham, Alabama.[1] A Cumberland classmate described Baumhammers as \"gregarious, a good student, in the top third of his class.\" After graduating from Cumberland, Baumhammers enrolled in a specialized one-year international program at the University of the Pacific's McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, California, where he received a master's degree in transnational business practice and specialized in both immigration law and international law.[1]\nFor several years in the mid-1990s, Baumhammers lived in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was listed with the International Law Section members of the Georgia Bar Association. He was an active member as of March 2000.[1]\nRichard Baumhammers returned to Pittsburgh in the late 1990s and lived with his parents following a series of emotional problems. Baumhammers had been treated for mental illness since 1993 and had voluntarily admitted himself to a psychiatric ward at least twice.[4] Later, he would obsess about his physical appearance, believing that his face had been scarred by sunlight. However, dermatologists told Baumhammers that his skin was \"perfectly normal.\"[1] His father, Andrejs, would later say that he had seen signs of mental illness since Baumhammers was four years old.[1]\nIn 1993 Baumhammers traveled to Europe for a vacation, and upon returning home, his father was shocked by his son's emotional state. Andrejs would later testify that Baumhammers told him that during a visit to Ukraine, he became \"euphoric\"; but that by the time he traveled to Finland, he believed people were following and harassing him.[1]\nAndrejs would also claim later that Baumhammers told his parents that he could no longer speak openly to them because he believed the FBI was monitoring the house. Baumhammers insisted that his parents had to go into the basement to talk with him, using a pen and notepad.[1] Andrejs Baumhammers claimed that Baumhammers even asked at one point to be taken to Dr. Kevorkian to help him commit suicide.[1]\nRichard Baumhammers admitted himself to Pittsburgh's Western Psychiatric Institute hospital and was diagnosed with delusional disorder of the persecutional type by Dr. Matcheri Keshavan.[1] Over the next several years, Baumhammers would see eight psychiatrists, four clinical psychologists and try 16 different medications.[1] After his release, Baumhammers stayed with his parents in their Mt. Lebanon home. He was a member of the Allegheny County Bar Association until he let his membership lapse in 1999.\nIn 1997, the now-unemployed Baumhammers traveled to Riga, Latvia, where he lived in an apartment on Kr. Barona Avenue which was less than a block from where his grandparents had lived in the mid-1930s. He acquired Latvian citizenship and sought to regain some of the family's properties lost during the Soviet occupation of Latvia. He made a claim under Latvia's de-nationalization process but was too late, as any claims had been required to be filed by 1996.[5]\n",

Steady B was a member (and de facto leader) of Philadelphia's Hilltop Hustlers crew. His musical career was relatively short-lived, and he is currently serving a life sentence in a Pennsylvania state prison for his role in the murder of Philadelphia Police officer Lauretha Vaird during a botched bank robbery in 1996.\nMcGlone, affectionately known as \"Boobie\", was raised in the Overbrook section of West Philadelphia. More specifically in the Hilltop area, which runs roughly between the corridors of 59th Street and Lansdowne Avenue and 63rd Street and Lancaster Avenue. McGlone was introduced to hip hop while attending the former Hanna Elementary School and started practicing his freestyle skills. He would later attend and matriculate at the former Shoemaker Jr. High School. Whilst attending Overbrook High School, McGlone began testing his rap skills in battles with, among others, future Hollywood icon Will Smith, who was then known as the Fresh Prince. It was during this time that he changed his name to Steady B (Boobie).\nSteady B's original DJ was Grand Dragon K.D., later replaced by DJ Tat Money, who later became the DJ for Kwam\u00e9 and a New Beginning. At his best, Steady B mixed well-written metaphors and wordplay with sparse yet catchy drum tracks. He released five albums over the course of his career, with mixed success.[1]\nSteady B and Grand Dragon K.D. released a few early hip hop 12\" singles on the Pop Art label in 1985. These included \"Take Your Radio\" (an answer record to LL Cool J's \"I Can't Live Without My Radio\"), \"Fly Shant\u00e9\" featuring Roxanne Shant\u00e9, and \"Just Call Us Def\".[1] Neither of these early 12\" singles feature on albums.\nSteady B and Grand Dragon K.D. appeared at \"UK Fresh 86\" at Wembley Arena in London on July 19, 1986, known as the Hip Hop Woodstock. Recordings of his set only featured one track, \"Do the Fila\", his answer to Joeski Love's \"Pee-Wee's Dance\".\nIn 1991, Steady B formed the hardcore hip hop group C.E.B.[1] with fellow local Philadelphia emcees Cool C and Ultimate Eaze, in an effort to update his style and record sales. C.E.B.'s name was a backronym for \"Countin' Endless Bank\", but it was also an acronym for the names of the group's three members. The trio released its only album, Countin' Endless Bank, on Ruffhouse Records in 1992. The single \"Get the Point\" reached No. 5 on Billboard's Hot Rap Singles.[2] The album was poorly received.[3]\nOn January 2, 1996, Steady B, along with C.E.B. bandmate Cool C and another local Philadelphia rapper, Mark Canty, attempted a bank robbery at a PNC bank branch in Feltonville, Philadelphia. During the botched heist, in which Steady B served as the getaway driver in a stolen minivan, Philadelphia Police Officer Lauretha Vaird, who responded to the bank's silent alarm,[4] was shot and killed by Cool C.[5] Vaird, an African American woman and the single mother of two children, was the first female Philadelphia police officer slain in the line of duty.[4] The incident inspired the song \"Slipped Away (The Ballad of Lauretha Vaird)\", which appeared on Philadelphia trio G. Love and Special Sauce's album Yeah, It's That Easy.\nSteady B was arrested at his apartment shortly after the bank robbery. Two handguns left at the scene by Cool C and Canty, including the murder weapon, were traced back to Steady, and he eventually confessed to his role in the crimes to police during interrogation.[6]\n",

This incident gained international attention due to the lack of calls to authorities despite several bystanders around the area, allowing the assault to carry on for over 30 minutes until an off-duty SEPTA employee reported the incident, resulting in SEPTA's swift arrest of the suspect.\nAt around 9:20 PM, 35-year-old Fiston M. Ngoy (born August 8, 1986), an often-homeless individual and a resident from Philadelphia, began sexually harassing a woman sitting next to him on a Market\u2013Frankford Line train. This continued for about 30 minutes, with the woman repeatedly pushing Ngoy off her until he ripped her pants down at 9:53 PM and raped her for 6 minutes.[1][2] According to SEPTA surveillance video, there were several bystanders witnessing the incident,[2] even holding up their cellphones during the assault, and failing to alert authorities or stop the assault until one off-duty employee called 911 after boarding the train and noticing \"something wasn't right\".[1]\nAfter the initial 911 call, a SEPTA security officer boarded the train when it arrived at the 69th Street Transportation Center, arresting Ngoy for the assault after pulling him off the victim.[3] According to SEPTA general manager Leslie Richards, the arrest occurred 3 minutes after the initial 911 call.[4] Investigators were able to charge Ngoy with rape, sexual assault and aggravated indecent assault without consent after viewing the video recording, holding him at the Delaware County Jail with bail set at $180,000.[5]\nDuring Ngoy's initial court proceedings in November, he claimed it was a consensual act, but the victim stated that was not the case and that she had been drinking before boarding the train. She testified in court that she had repeatedly attempted to push Ngoy off her until she \"blacked out\".[6]\n\"I'm appalled by those who did nothing to help this woman. Anybody that was on that train has to look in the mirror and ask why they didn\u2019t intervene or why they didn't do something.\"[5]\nTimothy Bernhardt, superintendent of the Upper Darby Township Police Department\nSEPTA and the Upper Darby Police Department condemned the attack and criticized passengers for their delayed action.[3] SEPTA spokesperson Andrew Busch released a statement, saying \"There were other people on the train who witnessed this horrific act, and it may have been stopped sooner if a rider called 911.\"[4]\nIn response to allegations that passengers holding up their phones were videorecording the assault, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer refuted the claim, countering that many of the bystanders may not have understood what they were seeing.[7] Stollsteimer also stated that the bystanders would not face prosecution charges, as Pennsylvania does not allow for prosecution of witnesses to a crime,[8] urging them to come forward with information about the case.[2]\n",

As a front for his illegal activities he gave people the impression that he was a plumber or a hardware store owner. He came from the Italian community of Chambersburg which is now part of Trenton. At one time, Spirito, who was involved in loansharking and bookmaking, was considered a close associate of both Harry Riccobene and of Riccobene's half-brother, Mario. He worked in the Scarfo crime family during the 1980s, during Nicodemo Scarfo's reign. Pasquale (Pat the Cat) Spirito was an associate of made man Joseph (Joey Chang) Ciangalini who introduced Spirito into the life of organized crime. Pat earned the nickname amongst his fellow associates as 'The Cat' because of con artist charm and demeanour. He was an associate until he was the getaway driver in the murder of John Calabrese, a long-time drug dealer who served under Angelo Bruno and then became a 'made man' under Phil Testa with Francis (Faffy) Iannarella and Andrew Thomas DelGiorno at a secret induction ceremony at the home of mob associate Robert (Toro) Locicero in Vineland, New Jersey. He was married but was a constant womanizer. John Calabrese was murdered on October 6, 1981 in Southwest Center City, Philadelphia. Pat recruited Nicholas Caramandi, Charles Iannece, and Ralph Staino Jr. as his associates, eventually elevating them all to 'proposed members' to Scarfo. On June 8, 1980 Phil Testa held a Cosa Nostra initiation ceremony at the South Philadelphia home of mob captain John Cappello.\nSpirito was almost shotgunned to death in his Cadillac while driving down the street by Harry Riccobene loyalists. This was shortly before the attempted mob hit of Scarfo crime family capo Salvatore Testa in April 1982. The attempted murder of Spirito was in retaliation for murdering 35-year-old Samuel (Little Sammy) Tammburino, murdered by Charles Iannece and Francis Ianarella as he left a pharmacy-convenience store in South Philadelphia that was owned and operated by Tammburino's parents shooting him sixteen times.\nIt is speculated that Spirito was killed because he was being a nuisance to the family, he lacked ambition and willingness to perform hits under the orders of Nicodemo Scarfo, or Scarfo thought he was useless to the organization and that his prominence in the family had to be put to an end like most of Scarfo's former associates and wiseguys. Spirito had recently switched allegiance, aligning himself with Scarfo. It is believed that Spirito had been chosen to kill either Marco or Bobby Riccobene and that when he failed to do so he was marked for death.[1] Furthermore, Phil Leonetti stated in the book Mafia Prince that Scarfo was infuriated when Spirito told Scarfo who should be made captains and soldiers in the family. Scarfo felt insulted that an underling was telling him how to run the Philadelphia Mafia, and thus wanted to have him killed.\nMob boss Nicodemo Scarfo was starting to begin a violent genocide of his associates and every member of the family. An estimated total of 30 outsiders and made men were dead by the end of his reign, largely due to the Scarfo-Riccobene War and his own paranoia of disloyal and dishonest people. Scarfo ordered him to take out Bobby Riccobene. Spirito was reluctant, and  Scarfo sent Nicholas Caramandi and Charles Iannece Jr. to kill him.\nOn April 29, 1983, Pasquale Spirito was shot two times in the back of the head while sitting in his car in South Philadelphia. Spirito was killed for failing to carry out the contract to kill Robert Riccobene, the brother of Harry Riccobene.[2] Nick Caramandi, during an interview commented,\nWe tried for months to kill him, and for a while that's all we used to talk about. We used to get sick when we'd see him. We'd want to throw up. Pat had bad vibes and knew what was coming. This guy tried to work my head for hours the day before. He had me in a booth in a luncheonette drinking coffee for four hours, making me tell him how much I love him, and it's already set up to kill him the next night. I said, \"Pat, what are you talking like this for? I'd do anything for you. Hey! I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. Buddy, my life is yours. Jesus Christ, I love you.\" He was relieved.[3]Caramandi also said:\n\"Spirito was not cut out for the Scarfo mob. He had come out of Trenton and moved to South Philadelphia at a time when mob members were low-key operators concentrating on gambling, loan-sharking, and bookmaking. He was greedy and ambitious, attributes that Scarfo could appreciate, but he lacked the killer instinct. He thought he could slide by generating enough money to keep the Little Guy down the shore satisfied. But he underestimated Scarfo's bloodlust. Spirito was a money-maker, but he was also a whiner and complainer.\" After we killed him, \"everybody was happy. Everybody hated him. I never seen a guy hated so much.\"[4]",

The strike is also known as the Slovak Strike because about 70 percent of the miners were Slovak immigrants.[2] It began in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on March 9, 1910, and ended on July 1, 1911.  At its height, the strike encompassed 65 mines and 15,000 coal miners.[2][3] Sixteen people were killed during the strike, nearly all of them striking miners or members of their families.[4] The strike ended in defeat for the union.\nThe Irwin gas coal basin is an area in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.  It encompasses the townships of North Huntingdon, Penn, Sewickley, Salem, South Huntingdon, Hempfield and Irwin, and the boroughs of Murrysville, Export and Delmont. The coal mined in the district was unsuitable for use as coke. However, it was ideal for gasification and conversion into coal gas.[3]\nSeven companies dominated coal mining in the Irwin Basin in 1910.  In 1854, the Westmoreland Coal Company was formed to begin mining coal in the region.  In 1905, it bought a controlling interest in Penn Gas Coal, a company established in 1861 to gasify coal. Penn Gas Coal, in turn, had obtained a one-third ownership in the Manor Gas Coal Company. Through these purchases, Westmoreland Coal had a near-monopoly on the gas coal market, and was the largest bituminous coal company in Pennsylvania.[3][5] In 1892, Robert Jamison and his sons founded the Jamison Coal and Coke Company (originally the Jamison Coal Company).[6] In 1886, the Berwind family and Judge Allison White founded the Berwind-White Coal Mining Co.[7] In 1902, a number of smaller coal gas companies in and around Greensburg, Pennsylvania, merged to form the Keystone Coal and Coke Company. In 1905, Latrobe-Connellsville Coal and Coke Company was formed when Marcus W. Saxman merged three of his wholly owned or controlled coal companies.[8]\nThese companies were very paternalistic. Company towns (colloquially referred to as \"coal patches\") were established, company stores founded and workers often paid in company scrip.[3][9]\nCoal miners increasingly agitated for improved wages and working conditions after 1900. Miners demanded an eight-hour day and wages equal to those paid in the nearby Pittsburgh coal basin. Since miners were paid by the ton, workers also wanted to standardize the size of coal wagons to ensure they were paid fairly. Miners also sought to be paid for mining \"slack\" (very fine coal), and for \"dead work\" (laying of track, shoring up tunnels, pumping out water, and removing slate and clay).[3]\nWestmoreland Coal, Penn Gas Coal and Keystone Coal and Coke strongly resisted the miners' demands and any attempt at unionization. Companies used the Coal and Iron Police to physically intimidate and sometimes beat pro-union miners, workers were fired, and coal companies evicted families from the \"coal patches\" whenever miners struck.[3]\nThe situation came to a head in 1910. The coal companies reduced wages by 16 percent, paying only 58 cents per ton-and-a-half of coal mined.  The breaking point came when Keystone Coal and Coke announced that miners would have to begin using new safety lights and new forms of explosives\u2014and pay for these items themselves.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe 2014 Montgomery County shootings were a killing spree that occurred in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, United States, on December 15, 2014. The killings began at about 3:30\u00a0a.m. A woman was found dead in Lower Salford Township, two others were found dead in Lansdale, and three more were found in Souderton along with a wounded teenage boy.[4] Police identified the suspected killer as 35-year-old Bradley William Stone of Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, and the victims were his ex-wife and her family members. Most of the victims were shot, although some were also stabbed with a knife. After an extensive manhunt, Stone was found dead on the day after the killings in the woods near his home. He reportedly committed suicide by overdosing on several drugs.[5]\nAccording to an affidavit filed by prosecutors, Stone was armed with two handguns (a .40-caliber Heckler & Koch and a 9mm Beretta) and at least one knife.[3] The first killings occurred inside a home in Souderton at about 3:30\u00a0a.m. Stone attacked his former sister-in-law, her husband, and the couple's 14-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son. The couple and their daughter died, while the boy survived \"significant cutting injuries\" and blunt-force trauma to the head. He was eventually taken to the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital's trauma center in Philadelphia for treatment.[2][6][7] The first crime scene was not discovered until nearly 8:00\u00a0a.m.[2] Stone then went to a home in Lansdale, where he killed his former mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law at around 4:25\u00a0a.m.[8][9][10]\nAt around 4:55\u00a0a.m., Stone then fatally shot his ex-wife in her apartment in Lower Salford Township. Neighbors of the ex-wife were awakened by shouting and several gunshots. They looked out their window to see Stone taking his two daughters to his car. When they asked if everything was okay, Stone replied, \"She's hurt pretty bad, we've got to leave.\" Stone left with the children, and later dropped them off safely at the home of one of his neighbors in Pennsburg at around 5:30\u00a0a.m.[10][11][12][13] The .40-caliber handgun was found at the Lower Salford crime scene.[3][7][14]\nIn the afternoon of December 15, police descended on a home in Pennsburg where they believed Stone had barricaded himself; however, he was not there.[15]\nAt around 8:00\u00a0p.m., Stone was reportedly sighted in Doylestown. Police were called to an attempted carjacking near the area of North Shady Retreat Road and Burpee Road. The alleged victim informed police that he was approached by a man in camouflage, who was armed with a knife and fit the general description of Stone. A struggle ensued between the two, and the victim, who had a concealed gun,[1] fired shots at the carjacking suspect, who then fled into the woods. However, the sighting \"did not appear to be valid\", according to police.[16] The manhunt was centered on the wooded area off Burpee Road in Doylestown.\nPolice conducted an \"extensive search\" in and around Pennsburg, aided by K-9 units and a Philadelphia Police Department helicopter with infrared technology, and advised people to remain indoors, keep their doors locked and call 911 if they thought they had seen the suspect.[17][18] Schools in the area of the manhunt were closed on December 16. The shooter was described as having red hair and wearing brown or green military fatigues.[19][20]\nOn the day after the killings, Stone was found dead in a wooded area located half a mile from his home in Pennsburg. According to Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Ferman, the cause of his death was \"self-inflicted cutting wounds\" to his midsection. However, this was denied by a preliminary autopsy conducted by the county coroner's office, which also verified that he did not fatally shoot himself. A machete and a \"double-bladed black ax\", both coated in blood, were found near his body along with several pill bottles.[3][21] An autopsy by former Warren County Medical Examiner found a seven-centimeter stab wound to his upper thigh and three superficial cuts to the leg and hip area, authorities said. He also had ten scratches on his face and neck. The cause of death, following toxicology tests, was determined to be a drug overdose from a combination of trazodone, an antidepressant; mCPP, a metabolite of trazodone; and risperidone, used to treat schizophrenia. The death was ruled a suicide.[5]\nSix people were killed and one was seriously injured. The suspect's ex-wife, Nicole Hill, was reportedly the last fatality.[22] Also killed were Hill's mother, Joanna Koder Hill,[10] and grandmother Patricia Hill, as well as her sister Patricia Flick, brother-in-law Aaron Flick, and 14-year-old niece Nina Flick. Hill's 17-year-old nephew, Anthony Flick, was wounded at the same location where his family was killed. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment for stab wounds to the head and hand and also blunt-force trauma to the head that resulted in a gaping skull fracture.[6][23][24] He was declared to be in \"serious but stable condition\".[22]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe 1835 Philadelphia general strike took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  It was the first general strike in North America and involved some 20,000 workers who struck for a ten-hour workday and increased wages. The strike ended in workers successfully negotiating for and securing both.[1]\nPrior to the shorter work day movement, employers had hired and paid workers on the basis of the agriculture working day of \"sun to sun\" (sunrise to sunset) \u2013 a situation which meant comparatively short hours in the winter months but days extending to as many as fifteen hours during the late spring and early summer.[2] For some trades this worked out to a manageable average over the course of a year, but for the construction trades in particular, a business marked by heavy unemployment during the winter months owing to the weather, this state of affairs was regarded as an intolerable burden.[2] As a result, the idea emerged that the length of the work day should be fixed by time rather than the rise and fall of the sun, and agitation for a ten-hour day began.[3]\nDuring the 1820s and 1830s, a number of strikes were commenced to shorten the work day. In June 1827 some 600 Philadelphia journeymen carpenters\u2014that is, the wage laborers employed by master carpenters\u2014went on strike for the citywide establishment of the ten-hour day.[3] Carpenters in Boston, Massachusetts, similarly struck for a ten-hour workday in 1825 and 1832. However, the strikes were unsuccessful at shortening the work day.[4]\nIn 1835 Boston carpenters went on strike again for a ten-hour workday and were soon joined by masons and stone-cutters. The strikers chose Seth Luther and two other workers as leaders, and they issued a circular stating their demands.[5] The circular read in part \"We have been too long subjected to the odious, cruel, unjust and tyrannical system which compels the operative mechanic to exhaust his physical and mental powers. We have rights and duties to perform as American citizens and members of society, which forbid us to dispose of more than ten hours for a day's work.\"[4]\nDuring the strike, the Boston workers organized a travelling committee and requested the assistance of workers in other cities.  The Boston circular was well received by workers throughout the country. Although the Boston strike was eventually defeated, the circular was pivotal in motivating workers in Philadelphia to organize their own strike that year for a ten-hour workday. The president of the Carpenter's Society of Philadelphia, William Thompson, told Seth Luther that \"the carpenters considered the Boston circular had broken their shackles, loosened their chains, and made them free from the galling yoke of excessive labor.\"[5]\nInfluenced by events in Boston, unskilled Irish workers on the Schuylkill River coal wharves the same year went on strike for a ten-hour day.  Three hundred workers marched on the coal wharves. They were led by a worker with a sword who threatened death to anyone who crossed the picket line and unloaded coal from the 75 vessels waiting in the water.[6] The coal heavers were soon joined by workers from many other trades, including leather dressers, printers, carpenters, bricklayers, masons, house painters, bakers, and city employees.[1]\nOn June 6, a mass meeting of workers, lawyers, doctors, and a few businessmen, was held in the State House courtyard.  The meeting unanimously adopted a set of resolutions giving full support to the workers' demand for wage increases and a shorter workday, as well as increased wages for women workers and a boycott of any coal merchant who worked his men more than ten hours.[7]\nThe strike quickly came to a close after city public works employees joined the action. The Philadelphia city government announced that the \"hours of labour of the working men employed under the authority of the city corporation would be from 'six to six' during the summers season, allowing one hour for breakfast, and one for dinner.\"[8]  On June 22, three weeks after the coal heavers initially struck, the ten-hour system and an increase in wages for piece-workers was adopted in the city.[1] On 8 July 1835, the Commandant of the Philadelphia Navy Yard, James Barron, wrote to the Board of Navy Commissioners, \"The Mechanics in this city of all denominations have recently made, as it is termed, a turnout, for a regulation in the hours of labor, and so general...there is no probability they will secede from their demands\" After which, on August 26, 1835 Commodore John Rodgers, of the Board of Navy Commissioners, signed a circular order,  which was transmitted to all Naval Yards establishing the new workday as ten hours.[9]\n",

Nine other people were injured.[1] The fitness center is approximately 10 miles (16\u00a0km) south of Pittsburgh,[2] in the Great Southern Shopping Center, a strip mall located in the Kirwan Heights section of Collier Township, just outside of the borough of Bridgeville.\nThe shooting occurred at a women's aerobics class at the LA Fitness center at approximately 8:15\u00a0p.m. The shooter entered the class, placed a duffel bag on the ground, turned off the lights, took out two handguns and began firing, police said. According to police, the gunman fired 52 shots with two Glock 9\u00d719mm semiautomatic pistols before committing suicide by shooting himself in the head with a .45-caliber revolver.[1][3] A .32-caliber semiautomatic pistol found in his pocket was not used.[4]\nThree women and the gunman died, and about nine other people were injured. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's office identified the three women who died as Heidi Overmier, 46, of Collier Township; Elizabeth Gannon, 49, of Green Tree, Pennsylvania; and Jody Billingsley, 38, of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania.[5]\nGeorge Sodini (September 30, 1960[6] \u2013 August 4, 2009), a 48-year-old systems analyst at the law firm of K&L Gates and a resident of Scott Township, was identified as the perpetrator.[7] He had written about contemplating carrying out a shooting, which he referred to as the \"exit plan\",[3] while also revealing that he \"chickened out\" of carrying out such a shooting earlier in the year. His website states that he was \"never married\" and concludes \"Death Lives!\" Sodini states, \"Probably 99% of the people who know me well don't even think I was this crazy.\" Sodini is reported to have left a note inside the gym bag stating his hatred for women.[5] Nearly a week after the murders, it was revealed that Sodini had brought an inert grenade on a Port Authority bus on July 28, 2009. After a passenger sitting next to him notified police, he was questioned about the incident but no charges were filed.[8]\nOn a website registered in his name,[9] Sodini chronicled over a nine-month period his rejections by women and his severe sexual frustration. \"Who knows why? I am not ugly or too weird. No sex since July 1990 either (I was 29)\", he writes. \"Last time I slept all night with a girlfriend it was 1982. Girls and women don't even give me a second look ANYWHERE\". About his problems with women, he wrote: \"Women just don't like me. There are 30 million desirable women in the US (my estimate) and I cannot find one\". In 2008, Sodini posted online videos, in which he discusses his emotions, along with a tour of his home, the latter which was a homework assignment from \"a self-help seminar [he] had attended on how to date women\".[10]\nTGSCOM Inc., an online gun wholesaler based in Green Bay, Wisconsin, sold Sodini an empty Glock 9\u00a0mm magazine and magazine loading apparatus used in the attack.[11] TGSCOM sold a used handgun to Seung-Hui Cho, who subsequently used it during the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings.[11] TGSCOM also sold an empty magazine and a holster to Steven Kazmierczak, who shot and killed five people at Northern Illinois University in 2008.[11] TGSCOM closed in 2012, having become the subject of investigations by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Wisconsin Better Business Bureau, and Green Bay police.[12]\nOn August 18, it was revealed that Sodini bequeathed his estate, valued at $225,000, to his alma mater the University of Pittsburgh.[13] A spokesperson for the university stated that it had \"no interest in receiving any such distribution\" and requested that it go to the victims and the victims' families.[14]\nIn March 2012, State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. filed a legal motion attempting to preemptively seek exemption from liability under Sodini's $100,000 personal liability policy. Victims of the shooting claim that the insurance company neglected to ensure Sodini got mental health care.[15]\n",

He had formerly been sentenced to death by the state of New Jersey on May 6, 1995 for his part in the fatal shooting of Franklin Township police sergeant Ippolito Gonzalez.[1] However, he was ultimately beaten to death at New Jersey State Prison by a fellow death row inmate before he could be executed.[2]\nRobert Ronald Simon was born on September 4, 1951, in Darby, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. His criminal wrongdoings reportedly began as early as age 8.[3] Additionally, he was placed into juvenile detention on at least two separate occasions.[4]\nThroughout his youth, Robert Simon was a member of an Upper Darby street gang known as the Warlords. The Warlords would eventually merge with another group from Darby to create the Warlocks Motorcycle Club - also referred to as the Philly Warlocks. Founded in 1967, the Warlocks MC are self-described as a \"one-percenter\" outlaw motorcycle club and are designated as a violent criminal organization by law enforcement. Although the club was predominately based within their founding location of Philadelphia as well as other parts of Pennsylvania, they also maintained a chapter within New Jersey.[4][5]  Being a member of the gang was such a substantial part of Simon's life to the point where he would even tout his religion as \"Warlock\".[6] He was said to have held the club title of \"enforcer\" - and was utilized by his fellow Warlock co-founders to intimidate the club's rivals.\nThe Warlocks Motorcycle Club menaced the state of Pennsylvania during the 1970s and Simon was often described as an ill-tempered and especially dangerous member by those who knew and encountered him. At various points in his career as a hardened outlaw biker, Simon burned down a store Ocean City, New Jersey boardwalk and committed armed robbery.[4] A frequent user of drugs and alcohol, he went by the club moniker \"Mudman\" as well as informal nickname of \"Bobby Simon\".[7] At one point, Robert Simon had a spider-web tattooed onto his elbow - which was rumored to signify he had murdered someone.\nIn 1982, Simon was convicted for the 1974 second-degree murder of his 19-year-old girlfriend, Beth Smith Dusenberg, who had refused to engage in group sex with him and other members of the Warlocks MC.[8][9] According to his fellow Philly Warlock bikers, Simon talked about having sexual intercourse with Dusenberg's mummified corpse after he buried it in a water-filled strip mine near Hazleton and even hoped to decorate his jail cell with physical photographs of such evidence.[10] John Lavelle, the Judge who handled Simon's trial, stated that dozens of Warlocks bikers would circle the courthouse on their motorcycles each day in during 1995 in an attempt to intimidate the jurors - quite possibly the reason behind his conviction for second degree murder instead of first degree murder.[11][12]\nSimon subsequently received a 10-to-20 year sentence for the homicide and was initially housed at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Graterford (but later transferred).[13] Throughout his prison tenure, he received a total of 49 misconducts - which included drug trafficking in addition to drug use.[7] Robert \"Mudman\" Simon was also suspected of murdering an inmate at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Pittsburgh during his incarceration period. However, he was acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.[14]\nOn January 21, 1993, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (PBPP) denied a parole application they received from Simon citing his high risk of continued involvement with the Philly Warlocks along with his need for substance abuse treatment.[15] Despite this, he was classified as merely a \"low risk\" on parole assessment documents.[16]\nAfter a total three parole rejections, Simon was recommended for parole in November 1994 by a PBPP hearing examiner under the conditioned that he abstain from alcohol and avoid contact with the Warlocks Motorcycle Club. Suspiciously, it is known that one of the club's members began to make arrangements for Simon's living arrangements even before Simon's parole was approved.[17]\nSimon was paroled in February of 1995, having served a total of 12-and-a-half-years of prison time. With approval from the New Jersey parole board, he settled at Black Horse RV Trailer Park in Williamstown, New Jersey when released. The property, known was owned by Marianne Mihalick who lived with her daughter right across from his trailer home at 3944 South Black Horse Pike. As claimed by Mihalick, they both had been unaware of Simon's murderous homicidal history as he misled them to believing he was just a reformed drug dealer.[18]\n",

        "paragraph": "The murder of Jeanne Clery occurred in 1986 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania at Lehigh University. Clery, who was a freshman at the time of her death, was raped and killed in her campus dormitory. Clery's parents, who believed the university had failed to share vital information with its students regarding campus safety, campaigned for legislative reform for several years following their daughter's death.\nTheir efforts resulted in the passage in 1990 of the Clery Act, a federal law requiring all universities and colleges receiving federal student financial aid programs to report crime statistics, alert campus of imminent dangers, and distribute an Annual Campus Security Report to current and prospective students and employees, or face fines.\nJosoph Henry, another student, was convicted of murdering and raping Clery and was sentenced to death, but he later agreed to drop all appeals in exchange for life imprisonment without parole.[1]\nOn April 5, 1986, in the spring of her freshman year, Jeanne Clery was raped and murdered in Stoughton Hall at Lehigh University by Josoph M. Henry, who was also a student. Clery was awakened by Henry while he was in the process of burglarizing her room. He then beat, cut, raped, sodomized, and strangled her.[2][3] Prior to Clery's death, there were reports that her dorm had 181 situations of auto-locking doors being propped open by residents. Henry is believed to have gained access to Clery's room through the propped doors, as well as her own room door having been left unlocked for her roommate, who forgot her key.[2]\nHe was reported to the police after confessing the murder to his friends and was subsequently apprehended.[4] He was later sentenced to death via the electric chair, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upon appeal.[4][5] In 2002, after his death sentence was thrown out, Henry opted to give up his appeal rights and accepted life in prison rather than face another death penalty hearing with the possibility of a reinstated death sentence.[6] He is currently serving his sentence at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Dallas.[7]\nAs Connie and Howard Clery learned more about their daughter's death, they grew convinced that she had died because of \"slipshod\" security on campus. Beyond this, they believed the university had \"a rapidly escalating crime rate, which they didn't tell anybody about\". At the time, Lehigh University's vice president, John Smeaton, said that security measures were \"more than adequate, reasonable and appropriate for our setting and our situation. You can't prevent everything from happening.\"[2] Nonetheless, the Clery family believed that campus crime statistics had been significantly underreported, and her parents founded the nonprofit organization Security On Campus, Inc., later renamed the Clery Center for Security On Campus.[8][9][10]\nThe Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act or 'Clery Act' is a federal statute codified at 20 U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a01092(f), implementing regulations in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations at 34\u00a0CFR 668.46. The Clery Act, signed in 1990, was originally known as the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act.\nThe Clery Act requires all colleges and universities that participate in federal financial aid programs to keep and disclose information about crime on and near their respective campuses. Compliance is monitored by the United States Department of Education, which can impose civil penalties, up to $56,906 per violation, against institutions for each infraction and can suspend institutions from participating in federal student financial aid programs.\nEach year, institutions must publish and distribute their Annual Campus Security Report to current and prospective students and employees. This report is required to provide crime statistics for the prior three years, policy statements regarding various safety and security measures, campus crime prevention program descriptions, and procedures to be followed in the investigation and prosecution of alleged sex offenses.\n",

On July 3, 1986 their mutilated and dismembered bodies were found burning at a baseball diamond in Middletown.[2][3]\nAfter getting into a light medium-sized van with two male clients on June 30, 1986, the men they had left with were never seen again. Other transgender sex workers describe the men last seen with the victims as being two white men between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five. The driver had curly dark hair and a mustache; the second suspect was blonde and clean shaven.[4] At 12:31\u00a0a.m. on July 3, 1986, police and firefighters responded to the report of a brush fire; the Fairless Hills Fire Co. found two burning bodies instead. Through meticulous fingerprint analysis, hands cut off of the charred victims were matched with prison records by the FBI, both being identified as Jonathan Streater and Faustino Arroyo.[5]\nTanya Moore was a thirty-one-year-old transgender sex worker. She was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tanya had over twenty arrests for prostitution in Pennsylvania going back thirteen years prior to her death. Tiffany Hall, a friend of Tanya and Tina said, \"Streater was clean cut and went to church\". but that Tina was \"boy crazy\" and estranged from her family; always getting bailed out of jail for prostitution and other offenses.[6]\nTina Rodriguez was a twenty-seven-year-old transgender sex worker. She was born in Puerto Rico, but grew up in Camden, New Jersey. She had over fifty prostitution arrests in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York prior to her death. Her half-brother, Arnaldo Mojica, told a newspaper in 1986 that Arroyo hadn't been seen at the family's home in Camden for six months leading up to the murders. Mojica said the family knew Arroyo was \"gay\". Arnaldo also said that Arroyo's mother \"went all the time to Philadelphia to get him out of jail, going on to say, \"We tried to help him, tell him to stay home, but he would always go away.\" Tina was the smaller of the two; weighing one hundred and twenty pounds (54\u00a0kg) at five\u00a0foot six\u00a0inches (1.68\u00a0m) tall.[7]\nAround 2001, a witness told police Moore and Rodriguez were killed by himself and an \"infamous member of the Warlocks Motorcycle Club\" after picking them up for sex and discovering they were transgender. No charges were filed because the statement was made under a proffer agreement.[8]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJames Wilson (September 14, 1742 \u2013 August 21, 1798) was a Scottish-born American Founding Father, legal scholar, jurist and statesman who served as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1789 to 1798. Wilson was elected twice to the Continental Congress, was a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, and was a major participant in drafting the U.S. Constitution. A leading legal theorist, he was one of the first four Associate Justices appointed to the Supreme Court by George Washington. In his capacity as the first professor of law at the College of Philadelphia (later to become the University of Pennsylvania), he taught the first course on the new Constitution to President Washington and his Cabinet in 1789 and 1790.\nBorn near Leven, Fife, Scotland, Wilson immigrated to Philadelphia in 1766 and became a teacher at the College of Philadelphia. After studying law under John Dickinson, he was admitted to the bar and set up legal practice in Reading, Pennsylvania. He wrote a well-received pamphlet arguing that the British Parliament's taxation of the Thirteen Colonies was illegitimate because the colonies lacked representation in Parliament. In 1775, he was elected to the Continental Congress, where he signed the Declaration the next year. In addition to his roles in public service, Wilson served as president of the Illinois-Wabash Company, a land speculation venture.\nWilson was a delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where he was a member of the Committee of Detail which produced the first draft of the Constitution. He was the principal architect of the executive branch of the federal government[2] and was an outspoken supporter of greater participatory democracy, a strong national government, and proportional legislative representation based on population. Along with Roger Sherman and Charles Pinckney, he proposed the Three-fifths Compromise, which counted three-fifths of each state's slave population toward that state's total population for the purposes of representation in the United States House of Representatives. While preferring the direct election of the president through a national popular vote, he proposed the use of an electoral college, which provided the basis of the Electoral College system ultimately adopted by the convention. Following the convention, Wilson campaigned for the Constitution's ratification, and his \"speech in the statehouse yard\" was reprinted in newspapers throughout the country. However, he opposed the Bill of Rights. Wilson also played a major role in drafting the 1790 Pennsylvania Constitution.\nIn 1789, Wilson joined the Supreme Court and also was named a professor of law on the faculty at the College of Philadelphia. Wilson experienced financial ruin in the Panic of 1796\u20131797 and was sent to debtors' prison on two occasions. In August 1798, he suffered a stroke, becoming the first U.S. Supreme Court justice to die.\nWilson was born at Carskerdo, near Ceres, Fife, Scotland, on September 14, 1742. He was the fourth of the seven children of Alison Landall and William Wilson, a Presbyterian farming family.[3] He studied at the universities of St Andrews, Glasgow and Edinburgh, but never obtained a degree.[4] While he was a student, he studied Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, including Francis Hutcheson, David Hume and Adam Smith.[5] He also played golf.[6] Imbued with the ideas of the Scottish Enlightenment, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in British America in 1765, carrying letters of introduction that enabled him to begin tutoring and then teaching at The Academy and College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania). He petitioned there for a degree and was awarded an honorary Master of Arts several months later.[7] In 1790, the university awarded him the honorary degree of LL.D.[7]\nWhile tutoring and teaching, Wilson began to study law in the office of John Dickinson. He attained admission to the bar in Philadelphia in 1767 and established a practice in Reading, Pennsylvania. His office was very successful, and he earned a small fortune in a few years. By then he had a small farm near Carlisle, Pennsylvania, was handling cases in eight local counties, became a founding trustee of Dickinson College, and was lecturing at The Academy and College of Philadelphia. In 1768 he was elected to membership of the American Philosophical Society, and from 1781\u20131783 he was the vice president of the society.[8] Wilson's religious beliefs evolved throughout his life and have been the subject of some dispute, as there are writings from various points of his life from which it can be argued that he leaned towards Presbyterianism, Anglicanism, Thomism, or Deism, although it has been deemed likely that he eventually favored some form of Christianity.[9]\nOn November 5, 1771, he married Rachel Bird, daughter of William Bird and Bridget Hulings; they had six children together: Mary, William, Bird, James, Emily, and Charles. Rachel died in 1786, and in 1793 he married Hannah Gray, daughter of Ellis Gray and Sarah D'Olbear; the marriage produced a son named Henry, who died at age three. Hannah had previously been the widow of Thomas Bartlett, M.D.[10]\nIn 1774, Wilson published \"Considerations on the Nature and Extent of the Legislative Authority of the British Parliament.\"[10] In this pamphlet, Wilson argued that the Parliament had no authority to pass laws for the American colonies because the colonies had no representation in Parliament. It presented his views that all power derived from the people. Yet, he wrote that the people owed their allegiance to the British king: \"A denial of the legislative authority of the British parliament over America is by no means inconsistent with that connexion, which ought to subsist between the mother country and her colonies.\" Scholars considered his work on par with the seminal works of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams of the same year. However, it was actually penned in 1768, perhaps the first cogent argument to be formulated against the authority of the Crown. Some scholars see Wilson as a leading revolutionary while others see him as a reluctant, elite revolutionary reacting to the stream of events determined by the radicals on the ground.[11]\n",

Williams confessed to the murder, although he later recanted his confession. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania wrongfully executed Williams for Robare's murder in 1931 when he was 16 years old, making Williams the youngest person ever executed in Pennsylvania.\nEfforts to posthumously exonerate Williams began in 2015 when his attorney's grandson researched the case, generating renewed interest in its details, particularly in the allegations that Williams's confession was coerced and that the real perpetrator of the murder may have been Robare's abusive ex-husband. In 2022, following a posthumous review of Williams's case, his conviction was overturned, and all charges against him were dismissed, effectively exonerating him.\nWilliams was born on July 23, 1914. He had ten siblings, including a sister named Susie Williams-Carter, who was Williams's only surviving sibling by 2015; Williams-Carter was still alive in 2022 when Williams's conviction was overturned.[1][2]\nAt the time of the murder, Williams was enrolled in the Glen Mills Schools, a reform institution in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, after committing crimes involving arson to a barn that caused $25,000 in damage, and burglarizing a post office when he was 12 years old.[1] Williams was at the school from July 1926 until the murder.[3] He lived in the same cottage as Vida Robare, a matron at the Glen Mills Schools, along with forty other black teenagers until approximately four months prior to Robare's murder; Robare ordered him relocated to a different cottage due to him repeatedly breaking rules while living there.[4][5]\nVida Robare worked at the Glen Mills Schools alongside Fred Robare, an agriculture instructor who, according to contemporaneous news reports, was her husband; later research by the grandson of Williams's attorney revealed that the Robares were actually divorced before the killing on the grounds of Fred Robare's \"extreme cruelty\" and domestic abuse towards Vida.[6][7]\nEarly reports of Robare's killing claimed that Fred, misidentified as her husband, returned home from work on October 3, 1930, and stumbled across the crime scene.[8] He alerted police afterwards, who arrived to find Robare lying in her bed, partially clothed, with over 35 stab wounds in her chest, a fractured skull, and a broken rib.[1][7] There was a bloody hand print on a nearby wall, ostensibly belonging to the killer.[8]\nEarly in the investigation, police posited that the murderer found Robare in bed reading a novel when he attempted to rape her and, upon failing, stabbed her with an ice pick and beat her with an unknown blunt instrument, therefore causing the skull and rib fractures. Delaware County authorities first questioned inmates at the reform institution where Robare and her husband worked.[8]\nThree days after the murder, authorities claimed that they had evidence linking Alexander Williams to Robare's murder.[9] They then announced that Williams had confessed to Robare's murder. Authorities alleged that Williams confessed to fatally stabbing Robare with an ice pick in spite of Robare futilely offering him money to stop stabbing her.[10] Initially, authorities claimed that Williams' motive was revenge against Fred Robare for an unknown reason; authorities also posited that Williams murdered Vida Robare because she caught him in the act of stealing a box of shoe polish from her house. However, days later, the confession was amended to reflect that Williams allegedly murdered Robare because she fought against a rape attempt.[11] Overall, Williams was interrogated five times, all without a parent or attorney present, and signed three confessions. No eyewitness or direct evidence connected Williams to the crime.[12]\nWilliams was moved to a secure, private location to discourage mob violence following his confession.[13] Soon after Williams' confession changed, District Attorney William McCarter announced his intentions to charge Williams with first degree murder.[11]\n",

The perpetrator, identified as 37-year-old Steve Stephens, posted a cellphone video of the shooting on his Facebook account, leading many media outlets, both during the manhunt and afterward, to dub Stephens the \"Facebook killer\".[2][3][4] A warrant was issued for Stephens for aggravated murder. Two days later, he died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound when cornered by police in Erie County, Pennsylvania.[4]\nThe shooting happened at around 2:00\u00a0p.m. EDT on April 16, 2017 (Easter Sunday), in the 600 block of East 93rd Street in Cleveland's Glenville neighborhood. Godwin, while walking around the streets, was carrying a bag to collect littered cans. Stephens uploaded a video of the event.[5][6] Seconds before the shooting, Stephens exited his car, approached the victim and then asked Godwin to, \"Say Joy Lane\", the name of a woman with whom Stephens had been in a romantic relationship. Stephens then said \"She's the reason why this is about to happen to you\", before fatally shooting Godwin, who fell to the ground after he was shot.[7] Facebook said the video was uploaded to the website after the fact, not livestreamed as initially reported.[8] In other Facebook posts, Stephens claimed responsibility for 13 murders, but police said they were not aware of any other victims.[6]\nA search for Stephens began soon after the shooting, prompting lockdowns at a number of locations, including Cleveland State University.[9] Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told reporters that detectives talked with Stephens by cellphone shortly after the shooting, but had no further contact with him since that time.[10]  The manhunt expanded to other states on the morning of April 17. Residents in Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, and Michigan were asked to be on alert,[11] and a US$50,000 reward was offered for information leading to Stephens' arrest on a charge of aggravated murder.[12][13] The FBI also aided the Cleveland Police Department.[14][15]\nAt 11:10\u00a0a.m. on  April 18, Stephens pulled into the drive-through lane of a McDonald's restaurant in Harborcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania, 100 miles (160\u00a0km) from the location of the shooting. An employee recognized Stephens from news reports and, after verifying with fellow employees, provided Stephens with part of his order, but stalled him by stating that his fries were still cooking. During this time police were called to the restaurant. Stephens, wary, left without his fries.[16]\nAs Stephens pulled out of the restaurant, state police gave chase heading westbound through Wesleyville, Pennsylvania. Stephens made it to the corner of Buffalo Road and Downing Avenue in the city of Erie, where Pennsylvania State Police successfully executed a tactical maneuver to bring the car to a stop. As police approached Stephens' car, he shot himself in the head, killing him instantly.[17][18]\nSteve William Stephens (December 10, 1979 \u2013 April 18, 2017) worked as a vocational specialist at Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency for children and families. He was wearing his work ID badge and repeatedly mentioned Beech Brook in multiple videos on the day of the murder.[22] Police confirmed there was no known connection between Godwin and Stephens prior to the shooting and that Godwin was selected at random.  Stephens' mother was quoted as having told authorities that Stephens told her by phone he was \"shooting people\" because he was \"mad with his girlfriend\" of about three years, who was confirmed to be safe and was cooperating with investigators at the time.[18]\nThe graphic video of Godwin's killing remained accessible to the public on Stephens' Facebook page for more than two hours on April 16 before it was removed by Facebook, according to a timeline shared by the company. The delay generated renewed criticism of Facebook over its handling of offensive content and, in particular, public posts of video and other content related to violent crimes.[23][24] \"We have a lot of work [to do], and we will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening\", Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his April 18 keynote address at F8, Facebook's annual developers' conference. \"Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert Godwin Sr.,\" Zuckerberg added.[25]\nOn May 3, 2017, Facebook announced that it was adding additional personnel to its \"global community operations\" team to proactively screen Facebook Live content for violent and other inappropriate content.  The new reviewers \"will also help us get better at removing things we don't allow on Facebook like hate speech and child exploitation\", Zuckerberg said.[26]\nOn September 2, 2017, a section of East 146th Street in Cleveland (where Godwin lived most of his adult life) was renamed \"Robert Godwin Sr. Way\" as a posthumous honor of his life and legacy in the neighborhood.[27]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Lombard Street riot was a three-day race riot in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1842.[1][2] The riot was the last in a 13-year period marked by frequent racial attacks in the city.[3][page\u00a0needed][4] It started on Lombard Street, between Fifth and Eighth streets.\nIn the early decades of the 19th century, there were significant increases in the city's black population, as large numbers of freed and fugitive slaves immigrated to Philadelphia, which was a few miles north of the Mason-Dixon line. During the 25 years prior to the riots, the city's black population grew more than 50-percent. At the same time, there were increasing numbers of Irish immigrants who were also separated from the larger society by their insularity and Catholicism.[3][page\u00a0needed]\nThere were periodic outbreaks of racial, ethnic, and religious violence among Irish Catholics, German Protestants, blacks, and even pacifist Quakers. These were the result of social and economic competition, especially between Irish Catholics and blacks, who were generally at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Many Irish refused to work on labor teams with blacks.[2][3][page\u00a0needed] According to one writer, Irish Catholics were often competitors for the lowest-paying, unskilled, and menial jobs, and they perceived the city's more successful black residents as flaunting their success, setting the stage for blacks to become targets for the Irish immigrants' frustration.[5][6]\nOn the morning of August 1, 1842, a parade was held by over 1,000 members of the black Young Men's Vigilant Association on Philadelphia's Lombard Street between Fifth and Eighth streets in commemoration of the eighth anniversary of the end of slavery in the British West Indies.[7] As the paraders neared Mother Bethel Church, they were attacked by an Irish Catholic mob.[1][7][8][9] The rioters moved west, setting fires and attacking firefighters and police as they went, heading for the home of African-American leader Robert Purvis. Purvis and his home were reportedly saved from the Irish mob solely by a Catholic priest's intervention.[7]\nRequests to the mayor and police for protection initially led to the arrest of several of the victims and none of the rioters. Over three days of attacks, the Second African American Presbyterian Church (on St. Mary's Street near Sixth Street), the abolitionist Smith's Hall, and numerous homes and public buildings were looted, burned and mostly destroyed.[9] The mayor had credible evidence of a plan to burn several local churches, which he ignored.[why?] Eventually, as the rioting began to subside, the local militia was brought in to restore order.[2][3][page\u00a0needed]\nAfterward, Mayor John Morin Scott refused to arrest most of those known to have led the riot. Of those arrested by the militia, most were found not guilty or otherwise released.[why?] The three or four who were convicted received only light sentences.[why?][10]\nIn March 2005, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission approved a historical sign at Sixth and Lombard streets to mark the event.[11]\n\nIt reads:",

        "paragraph": "\nTimothy John Piazza (September 25, 1997[1] \u2013 February 4, 2017) died as the result of hazing at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity at Pennsylvania State University at University Park, Pennsylvania. The incident led to closure of the fraternity's chapter at the university and, as of November\u00a014, 2017[update], at least 26 members of the fraternity face charges including involuntary manslaughter.[2] The initial investigation was led by Centre County District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller and Special Investigator Bruce Castor.[3]\nThe death of Tim Piazza led to the largest criminal indictment against a fraternity and its members in American history. More than 1,000 counts were levied against 18 members of Beta Theta Pi, including eight who were charged with involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault.[4] Additional charges were added later. Piazza's death became a 'turning point' for America's fraternities.[5]\nIn 2005, Penn State alumnus Donald G. Abbey, a member of Joe Paterno's first ever Penn State Nittany Lions football scholarship class and Beta Theta Pi alumnus, donated $1.2 million to renovate the Beta Theta Pi house. In 2006, Abbey raised another $3.5 million in renovation funds. This would go on to become the most expensive fraternity house renovation in American history.[6] The renovation was lauded by Paterno and his wife, Sue Paterno.[7] Throughout the renovation process, fraternity brothers smashed holes in the walls with baseball bats, leading Abbey to predict future damage to the property. He was a staunch critic of hazing, and due to the toxic culture he found in Beta Theta Pi, he installed an extensive video surveillance system to ensure he would be notified if an emergency situation ever occurred on the property.[8]\nThe Penn State chapter of Beta Theta Pi was known to have a deep history of hazing. Brothers once held a party on their front porch, yelling racial slurs at an African American Penn State student as he walked past the house. The house was once banned for having a front yard littered with used condoms along with hot sauce covering the entire Great Hall.[9]\nIn September 2016, a pledge named Kordel Davis was driven to a clinic after a night of hazing that left a gash on his head.[10] A fraternity brother nicknamed \"Pajamas\" saw Davis in a desperate state, and Davis asked \"Pajamas\" to drive him back to his dorm room. \"Pajamas\" texted Pledge Master Brendan Young this information, in which Young replied, \"Who? Cordell  [sic]. Not worth it.\"\nPiazza was a 19-year-old sophomore engineering student at Pennsylvania State University. He was a pledge of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity at the university. On the night of February 2, 2017, while undergoing hazing activities for the fraternity, Piazza, on an essentially empty stomach, drank large amounts of alcohol in a short time as part of an obstacle course called \"The Gauntlet\", which required each pledge to drink from a bottle of vodka, drink a beer, and finally drink from a bag of wine. It later was revealed that Piazza took prescription anti-depressants, which contributed to his inebriation. The fraternity was supposed to be alcohol-free after a suspension in 2009.[2]\nIn this state of intoxication, he fell on the basement stairs of the house and was knocked unconscious. He was carried to a couch, where surveillance cameras captured a conspicuous bruise that bloomed on his left abdomen; however, this was shown to have originated from another one of the alcohol-fueled rush events for fraternities that Piazza had attended a week earlier. Jonah Neuman, Lars Kenyon, and Edward Gilmartin colluded in prohibiting witnesses from calling 9-1-1. Neuman threw someone against a wall, Gilmartin labeled witnesses crazy and insane, whilst Kenyon downplayed the concerns of witnesses in group chats.\nSome time later, Piazza regained consciousness and rolled off the couch. Three brothers picked him up and placed him back on the couch. Security footage shows them poking Piazza in the face, to determine if he was okay, but he remained unconscious and unresponsive. Kordel Davis, a newly initiated fraternity chapter member, attempted to render aid to Piazza, encouraging fraternity members to dial 9-1-1 and get an ambulance to the house. He was shoved up against a wall and his attempts were ignored.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nKermit Barron Gosnell (born February 9, 1941) is an American former physician[2] and serial killer.  He provided abortions at his clinic in West Philadelphia.  Gosnell was convicted of the murders of three infants who were born alive after using drugs to induce birth, was convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of one woman during an abortion procedure, and was convicted of several other medically related crimes.[3][4][5][6][7]\nGosnell, based in the Mantua neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned and operated the Women's Medical Society Clinic, a non-compliant abortion clinic that was dubbed a \"house of horrors\" during the trial.[8] He was a prolific prescriber of OxyContin.[9] In 2011, Gosnell, his wife Pearl, and eight employees were charged with a total of 32 felonies and 227 misdemeanors in connection with deaths, illegal medical services, and regulatory violations. Pearl and the eight employees pleaded guilty to various charges in 2011 while Gosnell pleaded not guilty and sought a jury trial.[10]\nIn May 2013, Gosnell was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of three of the infants and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, an adult patient at the clinic following an abortion procedure. Gosnell was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour informed consent law. After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.[11][12] Gosnell was sentenced to an additional 30 years in prison for federal drug charges.[13]\nGosnell was born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the only child of a gas station operator and a government clerk[14] in an African-American family.[15] He was a student at the city's Central High School from which he graduated in 1959.[16][17] Gosnell initially attended the University of Pennsylvania,[18] then graduated from Dickinson College with a bachelor's degree.[19] He received his medical degree at the Thomas Jefferson University in 1966.[16]\nIt has been reported that Gosnell spent four decades practicing medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and a teen aid program.[16] He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua.[14][20] Gosnell told The Philadelphia Inquirer in October 1972: \"As a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them.\"[21]\nThat same year, Gosnell also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental \"Super Coil\" method invented by Harvey Karman. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. However, complications from the procedure were reported by nine of the women, with three of these reporting severe complications.[22][23]\nThe 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a \"respected man\" in his community, and a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce's \"Young Philadelphian of the Year\" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House.[21] By the late 1980s, however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien.[21]\nGosnell has been married three times. His third and current wife, Pearl, had worked at the Women's Medical Society as a full-time medical assistant from 1982 until their marriage in 1990.[1]  They have two children.[24] Gosnell has four other children from his two previous marriages.[24] In covering his background, media commentators drew attention to the \"incredibly diverse\" portrayals of Gosnell, touching on both his community works \u2013 the creation of the halfway house and teen aid program \u2013 contrasted with portrayals of his practice as an abortion mill in which viable fetuses and babies were routinely killed following illegal late-term procedures.[16]\n",

He was the second person to be executed in Pennsylvania since the United States reinstated the death penalty in 1976.[2]\nMoser was born on September 15, 1942, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was the son of a farmer and the fourth of five boys. After graduating from high school, Moser attended a Roman Catholic seminary of the Salvadorian order for two years. He left due to poor academic performance and worked at an elementary school for a year. Afterward, he joined the army and received rave reviews in a performance evaluation. He met his future wife, Linda, while stationed at Fort Dix in New Jersey. The couple got married on April 26, 1969.[3] He was a Vietnam veteran and former seminarian.[4]\nOn March 31, 1985, Moser attended Palm Sunday services at the St. James Episcopal Church in Evansburg, Lower Providence Township, Pennsylvania.[5] He had arranged to meet his ex-wife, Linda Moser, and his two daughters, Donna and Joanne Moser. Leon and Linda had divorced in September 1984. According to Linda's parents, her husband had beaten her on several occasions.[6] The girls were to spend the afternoon with Leon once the service ended. After the service, the four of them went outside to Leon's car. Leon asked Linda if he could take his daughters back to visit his parents' home in Wisconsin. Linda declined, and an argument ensued. Joanne got into the back seat of Leon's car, while Donna remained standing by the front of the car. As Linda walked back towards the church, Leon went to the back of his car and took out a bolt-action rifle.[7]\nHe aimed the gun at the back of Joanne's head and pulled the trigger. Linda turned around and screamed as Leon aimed at her and fatally shot her in the chest. He then took aim at Donna and shot her in the head. After the shootings, Leon placed the rifle at his side and fired into the air. He fell to the ground as if shot, and remained there until the police arrived.[8] Linda and Joanne were pronounced dead at the scene, while Donna later died at Norristown State Hospital.[9]\nMoser had been violent towards Linda in the past. In March 1984, he had put a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her. He had also previously grabbed her neck and choked her. Prior to the shootings, Moser had recently lost his job as a janitor and was also being treated at a psychiatric unit for depression.[10]\nMoser pleaded guilty to the murders and a weapon charge and was sentenced to death on January 24, 1986. He refused all appeals and did not fight his execution.[7][11] He made a statement in court in 1986 in which he said \"All I want to do, sir, is just die. Just give me the death penalty, sir. Please? And please have it carried out as soon as possible, sir. Please?\"[12]\nOn June 1, 1995, Moser and three other inmates on Pennsylvania's death row had their execution warrants signed by Governor Tom Ridge. Moser's was set for August 15.[13] Unlike the others, Moser wanted to be executed. Fellow death row inmate, Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was scheduled for execution two days after Moser, won a stay of execution on August 7.[14] Following the stay, Abu-Jamal and his supporters requested and encouraged Moser to fight to save his own life. Ultimately, Moser rejected their requests.[15]\nMoser was executed by lethal injection on August 16, 1995, at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Rockview. He declined to make a final statement. His last meal was two slices of pizza, cold cuts, pasta salad, a frosted cupcake, and Coca-Cola. He became the second person to be executed by the state of Pennsylvania since the resumption of the death penalty in 1976. He remains the second of only three people to be executed in Pennsylvania since the resumption of the death penalty.[16] The others were Keith Zettlemoyer in May 1995 and Gary M. Heidnik in 1999.[17]\nThe murders of Linda Moser and her daughters led to a change in the law in Pennsylvania. A year after Linda's death, the Pennsylvania General Assembly changed the state Crime Code, giving police the power to make arrests in domestic violence cases based on evidence. Prior to this, police had to witness an assault before making an arrest. In 1988, the legislature went further and amended the 1978 Protection from Abuse Act. The new amendments allowed women to file for protection without the assistance of a lawyer.[18]\n",

        "paragraph": "William Trautmann,\nNorton Hoffstot; Pearl Bergoff\nThe Pressed Steel Car strike of 1909, also known as the 1909 McKees Rocks strike, was an American labor strike which lasted from July 13 through September 8. The walkout drew national attention when it climaxed on Sunday August 22 in a bloody battle between strikers, private security agents, and the Pennsylvania State Police. At least 12 people died, and perhaps as many as 26.[2] The strike was the largest and most significant industrial labor dispute in the Pittsburgh area since the famous 1892 Homestead strike and was a precursor to the Great Steel Strike of 1919.\nFrank Norton Hoffstot's Pressed Steel Car Company, sited downstream from Pittsburgh on the south bank of the Ohio River in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, manufactured passenger and freight railroad cars on an assembly-line basis. It was America's second-largest rail car producer.[3] Pressed Steel employed a workforce of 6,000 people, mostly foreign born comprising 16 distinct ethnicities. The firm was infamous for its style of industrial peonage with immigrant workers.[4]\nWorking conditions in the plant were primitive even by Pittsburgh standards.[5] Pressed Steel Car Company was locally called \"The Last Chance\" and \"The Slaughterhouse\". In an interview with The Pittsburgh Leader, Rev. Father A.F. Toner, a priest at St. Mary Roman Catholic Church in McKees Rocks, said, \"Men are persecuted, robbed, and slaughtered, and their wives are abused in a manner worse than death ... all to obtain or retain positions that barely keep starvation from the door.\" The local coroner, Joseph G. Armstrong, estimated that deaths in the plant averaged about one a day and were often caused by moving cranes. One of the charges made by Slavic immigrant workers was that their wives and daughters were subject to sexual harassment and preyed upon to deliver sexual faviors as a way to repay food and rental debts, or forestall their collection, to the company agents.[6]\nParticularly galling to the workers was the use of the Baldwin contract, commonly known as \"pooling.\" Under this system, jobs were parceled out in lots by a foreman who contracted that it be done for a given sum, with the money paid to be divided pro rata by the men under him.[7] The system was rife with corruption, with workers often paying substantial kickbacks to the foreman to retain their jobs.[8] The system resulted in unpredictable and often insufficient rates of pay, as one sympathetic journalist reported:\nPresident [Frank N.] Hoffstot says that it has proven to be a very satisfactory arrangement. And it has \u2014 for the company. As evidence of this we saw several pay envelopes showing that many of the workers slave for practically nothing. One envelope showed that the owner worked nine days, ten hours a day, and got $2.75; another eleven days and received $3.75; another three days and got $1.75; another four days and got $1, and the fifth, who had been idle for two months, worked three days and received nothing.... The company manages the pooling system through the foreman \u2014 and the workers are skinned until their bones shine. *  *  *\nTwo years ago, before the pooling system was introduced, the men were making $3, $4, and $5 a day. Today most of them make 50 and 75 cents and $1 a day.\"[9]Adding further to the destabilizing misery was the company-owned housing, ramshackle dwellings housing six families and renting for $12 a month.[8] Moreover, the company owned the stores from which the workers had to buy their provisions at inflated prices, lest they lose their jobs.[8] The system of economic domination was particularly severe and there came a day when the breaking point was reached.\nThe strike was triggered on Saturday July 10, a payday on which many workers were shorter in their pay than usual. The men demanded an explanation; management refused to speak with the workers' representatives. James Rider, manager of The Pressed Steel Car Company, responded by hiring Pearl Bergoff, the notorious owner of strike-breaking paramilitary force.[10]  The first fatality was an immigrant striker named Stephen Horvat, shot and killed by a black strikebreaker called Major Smith.[11]  Two days later Berghoff had deployed 500 strikebreakers to the plant, most entering quietly by rail, although a boat called Steel Queen carrying 300 was rebuffed, at least initially, by strikers' gunfire on the shore.\n",

Racco was known as an early American Black Hand leader, extorting fellow Italian immigrants through the use of anonymous letters, which were covered in cryptic images such as black hand prints, skulls and daggers, and threatened the recipient, and in most cases his family with death if the extortion payment demanded was denied. Racco and an associate were responsible for the 1906 murder of a Pennsylvania Game Warden.\nOn April 24, 1906, the body of Pennsylvania State Game Warden Seely Houk was found in the Mahoning River in the western part of the state. Examination showed that Houk, missing since March 6, had been killed by a shotgun blast to the head.  Authorities suspected that local mafiosi poaching in the area killed the warden. An investigation by Detective Dimaio of the Pinkerton Detective Agency suggested that the murderer was most likely already in prison.\nInvestigators made little progress on the case until an inmate named Candido wrote to Dimaio claiming that the killers were local Calabrian Honored Society boss, Rocco Racco and his brother-in-law, Jim Murdocca.  According to Candido, Houk had caught the two men hunting out of season.  As a warning to them, Houk shot and killed Racco's favorite hunting dog.  In retaliation, the two men killed Houk.  By the time Dimaio had reached the prison to interview Candido, another mafiosi named Surace had threatened Candido.  Surace refused to cooperate until Dimaio allegedly whispered a password of the Calabrian Societ\u00e0 Honorata or Calabrese mafia. Surace immediately confessed that Racco had murdered Houk, which was corroborated by a second witness.\nAfter acquiring the murder weapon from Racco's wife, Dimaio traveled to see the imprisoned suspect. Racco identified the murder weapon as his own and was indicted for murder. Moved to New Castle, Pennsylvania, the trial gained national attention due to constant death threats against witnesses.

        "paragraph": "James Fitzpatrick (1748 \u2013 September 26, 1778), also known as Sandy Flash, was an American highwayman who operated in Chester and Delaware counties west of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during the American Revolutionary War. A Continental Army deserter, Fitzpatrick defected to the Loyalist side and entered folklore as a swashbuckling Robin Hood figure. He was popularized as a character named Sandy Flash in Bayard Taylor\u2019s novel The Story of Kennett, published in 1866.[1][2][3]\nFitzpatrick was born in 1748 in the village of Doe Run in West Marlborough Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, the son of a working-class Scots-Irish immigrant. In his youth, he completed an apprenticeship with a local blacksmith, John Passmore, and then worked as a journeyman blacksmith and farmhand.[2][3] Handsome and sandy-haired, Fitzpatrick stood 6 feet 4 inches in height. He excelled at wrestling, running, and other sports. After spotting Fitzpatrick riding home one morning after a dance, a farmer was said to have exclaimed, \"He went by like a sandy flash.\" While most such stories are apocryphal or embellished, they reflect Fitzpatrick's romanticized image.[3]\nUpon the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, Fitzpatrick volunteered for the Continental Army and went to Long Island with the Pennsylvania militia in the summer of 1776. Flogged as punishment for some minor infraction, Fitzpatrick deserted, swimming across the Hudson River at night and making his way home. He was arrested in Philadelphia and released from prison on condition that he rejoin the army, whereupon he promptly deserted a second time. In September 1777, Patriot militia from Wilmington, Delaware, attempted to arrest him at the farm where he worked, but Fitzpatrick threatened them with a rifle, forcing them to flee empty-handed.[2]\nWhen British General Sir William Howe invaded Chester County in September 1777, Fitzpatrick joined the British army, guided troop movements, and fought at the Battle of Brandywine. He roamed Chester County and Delaware County (which was part of Chester County until 1789), accosting and robbing Whig militia officers and tax collectors and working as a British scout. Although he claimed the title of captain, there is no evidence that he ever held a British military commission or commanded troops. Notably, many Chester County residents sympathized with the Loyalist cause, while others, including the Quakers who made up 40 percent of the population, remained neutral.[2]\nAfter the British withdrew from Philadelphia in June 1778, Fitzpatrick remained behind. He continued to harass the Continental Army and its supporters in the area, waging a personal vendetta against Whigs. On occasion he rode with the Doan Outlaws of Bucks County and partnered with fellow outlaw and boyhood friend Mordecai Dougherty.[3]\nFitzpatrick became notorious for bravado. After robbing two tax collectors, he stripped them, tied them to trees, and flogged them. On another occasion, he captured a militia officer who prided himself on his long hair. After stealing his officer's weapons, Fitzpatrick cut off the man's handsome queue as an added indignity. He once strolled openly into a Kennett Square tavern crowded with Whigs, who stood bragging what they would do to Fitzpatrick once they caught him. The outlaw ordered a drink before he was recognized, whereupon he drew a pistol and backed out, covering himself with a pistol before disappearing into the woods. On yet another occasion, Fitzpatrick attended a public meeting unarmed and in disguise, afterward capturing a boastful young militia officer after fooling him into thinking that an iron candlestick was a blunderbuss.[2][4]\nDespite his campaign of harassment and intimidation, Fitzpatrick was never accused of murdering or seriously wounding anyone. Like Robin Hood, he cultivated a reputation for gallantry and was reported to have given gifts to the poor and to have never stolen from the poor or mistreated a woman.[1][2][3][4]\nOn August 23, 1778, Fitzpatrick entered the Edgmont home of Robert McAfee, a militia captain, to rob him. McAfee and a servant girl, Rachel Walker, subdued the outlaw after a struggle. The Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania split the \u00a31000 bounty between them. On September 15, Fitzpatrick was convicted of burglary and highway robbery, crimes to which he confessed, and was sentenced to be hanged. He attempted to escape from prison three times but failed.[1][2][3][4]\nFitzpatrick was hanged on September 26 in a botched public execution. The rope used to hang him was too long, such that when he dropped from the gallows, his toes touched the ground. The hangman actually climbed onto Fitzpatrick's shoulders to force him down, strangling him to death.[1][5]\n",

        "paragraph": "Jason Keel Sweeney (July 29, 1986 \u2013 May 30, 2003) was a construction worker from Fishtown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who at the age of 16 was murdered by four teenagers for his paycheck on May 30, 2003. The perpetrators included a girl he was dating and his best friend since childhood. Due to the manner in which Sweeney was murdered, the ages of the teens involved, and the seeming indifference of the perpetrators, the crime received national media coverage.[2]\nJason Sweeney left school and was working for his father, a contractor, on a building project in Philadelphia. He recently met a girl he liked, 15-year-old Justina Morley, with whom he had a date on the evening of Friday, May 30, 2003. Unbeknownst to Sweeney, Morley engaged in sexual relations with two other 16-year-olds, Nicholas Coia and Edward Batzig Jr.[3] Batzig was Sweeney's best friend since the fourth grade. Nicholas Coia and his 17-year-old brother, Domenic Coia, were also friends with Sweeney, but the brothers later ended the friendship.[4]\nWith the promise of sex, Morley lured Sweeney to \"The Trails,\" a wooded area of Fishtown near the Delaware River, where Batzig and the Coia brothers were lying in wait. Batzig took the first blow, striking Sweeney in the head four or five times.[5]  Batzig and the Coia brothers then pummeled Sweeney, primarily on his head and face, with a hatchet, a hammer and a rock until he was dead. Batzig later told a detective how he hit Sweeney with the hatchet face four or five times. Batzig said, \"Jason started begging for his life, but we just kept hitting him.\"[6] Batzig also said that Sweeney looked at him during the beating and said, \u201cPlease stop, I'm bleeding,\" after which Batzig hit Sweeney again with the axe.[citation needed] They finished by dropping a boulder on the right side of his head.[7] Sweeney's head was crushed and the only bone left undamaged was his left cheekbone.[8] He was identified by a cut on his hand that he sustained at his construction job.[citation needed]\nFollowing Sweeney's murder, the four assailants stole the $500 cash he earned from work.[7] Before leaving the crime scene, the Coias, Batzig and Morley shared a group hug and split the money, which they used to buy jewelry and illegal drugs\u2014heroin, marijuana, and Xanax\u2014and then \"partied beyond redemption,\" according to Domenic.[6][9]\nDomenic Coia confessed in a court hearing that they were all involved in the murder of Sweeney. The police said the murder was planned days before. Part of the preparation of the murder was listening to the Beatles song \"Helter Skelter\" over forty times, prompting later news coverage to draw a parallel to the Manson family murders.[2][6] Joshua Staab, 18, a friend of Domenic Coia, said that the group bragged about their plan to kill Sweeney by using Justina Morley as \"bait.\" Staab also said that Batzig knew that Sweeney would have his paycheck earnings on him on the day of the murder. The prosecutor asked Staab about the teens' demeanor after the killing. Staab said, \"They seemed pretty fine. In a way, happy.\"[6]\nAlthough all four teens involved in the murder were drug addicts, they were not high before they murdered Sweeney. In response to a detective's question about whether they were high during the killing, Domenic Coia answered, \"No, I was as sober as I am now. It is sick, isn't it?\"[6] A detective involved in the case and a forensic psychologist later opined that the killers' motivation went beyond robbery and stemmed from envy and resentment of Sweeney's relative success in life.[10]\nIn his memoir, Domenic Coia gave a different account of the murder. Domenic claimed he panicked when Batzig actually hit Sweeney and only participated when he feared him and his brother getting caught. He also denies stating he was sober during the attack and states he later prevented them from killing Justina Morley as they feared she would testify. He also denies involvement in any plans for the murder before the day it happened.\nJustina Morley claimed that she started smoking marijuana at the age of 10, and shortly thereafter started taking prescription pills and snorting cocaine. April Frederick, Morley's mother, said her daughter started cutting her wrists at the age of 10. Morley was hospitalized for threatening suicide and self-mutilation in 2002. She was once admitted to Friends Hospital for cutting her wrists, knees and thighs, taking pills and displaying a suicide poem, which she penned on her door. Morley told her mother that she would commit suicide if her mother did not take her out of the hospital; her mother then took her out against the hospital's advice. Morley was expelled from public school in the eighth grade, which she then repeated at the private Holy Name of Jesus Catholic school in Fishtown.\nA psychiatrist hired by the defense team, William Russell, said the reason Morley began sexual activity at an early age \"was an attempt at validation of self-worth\". Morley testified that she had sex with both Nicholas Coia and Batzig in exchange for heroin just a few days before they murdered Sweeney.\nMorley was released on Dec. 20, 2020.\n[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Philadelphia nativist riots (also known as the Philadelphia Prayer Riots, the Bible Riots and the Native American Riots) were a series of riots that took place on May 6\u20148 and July 6\u20147, 1844, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States and the adjacent districts of Kensington and Southwark. The riots were a result of rising anti-Catholic sentiment at the growing population of Irish Catholic immigrants. The government brought in over a thousand militia\u2014they confronted the nativist mobs and killed and wounded hundreds.\nIn the five months leading to the riots, nativist groups had been spreading a false rumor that Catholics were trying to remove the Bible from public schools. A nativist rally in Kensington erupted in violence on May 6 and started a deadly riot that would result in the destruction of two Catholic churches and numerous other buildings. Riots erupted again in July after it was discovered that St. Philip Neri's Catholic Church in Southwark had armed itself for protection. Fierce fighting broke out between the nativists and the soldiers sent to protect the church, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. Two of the 13 Catholic churches were burned. The Catholic Church sued the city and won some money for repairs. Civic leaders deplored the nativist attacks. Nationally, the riots helped fuel criticism of the nativist movement, despite denials of responsibility from nativist groups. The riots exposed deficiencies in law enforcement in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts, influencing various reforms in local police departments and the eventual consolidation of the city in 1854.[2]\nAs Philadelphia became industrialized, immigrants from Europe, mostly Ireland and Germany, settled in the city and especially in the surrounding districts. In the areas the immigrants settled, tensions that resulted from religious, economic and cultural differences grew between residents. Most new arrivals were Catholic.[3]\nHistorian Elizabeth Geffen states:\nthese new arrivals, impoverished, unskilled, and Catholic, immediately confronted an ancient enemy, the Protestant Scotch-Irish, longtime resident in Philadelphia, proud of their \"in\" status, mostly skilled workers, and ready, eager, and able to renew the political, economic, social, and religious feuds of the old country. During the 1830s they had organized an Orange Society for that express purpose.[4]Alarmed by the rising Catholic population, Protestants and native-born Americans started organizing anti-Catholic and nativist groups. On August 26, 1842, an anonymous arsonist set ablaze the bridge of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company. Immediately the responsibility was attributed to the local Irish Catholic community, sparking the founding of a Protestant Institute.[5] The group, alongside others established in the early 1840s, distributed anti-Catholic literature and published anti-Catholic newspapers.[6]\nDuring the 1840s, students in Philadelphia schools began the day with reading the Protestant version of the Bible. On November 10, 1842, Philadelphia's Roman Catholic Bishop, Francis Kenrick, wrote a letter to the Board of Controllers of public schools, asking that Catholic children be allowed to read the Douay version of the Bible, used by Roman Catholics. He also asked that they be excused from other religious teachings while at school.[7][8] As a result, the Board of Controllers ordered that no child should be forced to participate in religious activities and stated that children were allowed to read whichever version of the Bible their parents wished. Nativists further inflamed hostile feelings towards Catholics by reportedly twisting Kenrick's requests to the Board of Controllers as an attack against the Bible used in Protestant devotionals.[7][9]\nApproximately one year later, a rumor was circulated that Hugh Clark, a Catholic Kensington school director, was visiting a girls school, where he demanded that the principal stop Bible reading in school. The story also claimed that the principal refused and that she would rather lose her job. Clark denied this version of events and claimed that after finding out several students had left a Bible reading to read a different version of the Bible, he commented that if reading the Bible caused such confusion, it would be better if it were not to be read in school. Protestants claimed that Catholics, with direct influence from the Pope, were trying to remove the Bible from schools.[9][10] Kenrick issued a statement[when?] asserting, \"It is not consistent with the laws and the discipline of the Catholic Church for her members to unite in religious exercises with those who are not of their communion.\"[8]\nHistorian David Montgomery argues that the Irish Catholic Democrats in the city had successfully appealed to the upper-class Whig leadership. The Whigs wanted to split the Democratic coalition, so they approved Bishop Kenrick's request that Catholic children be allowed to use their own Bible. That approval outraged the evangelical Protestant leadership, which rallied its support in Philadelphia. Montgomery states:\n",

He became the first person to be executed in Pennsylvania since the United States reinstated the death penalty in 1976.[2][3]\nZettlemoyer was born on June 4, 1955, in Aberdeen, Maryland. He was the oldest of five children and had four sisters. In his early years, he tried to join the army but was unsuccessful. As such, he worked a variety of different jobs and was a photographer, a custodian, and a maintenance worker.[4]\nIn the early hours of the morning on October 13, 1980, two police officers were out on patrol in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in an unmarked car. They heard gunfire coming from a nearby wooded area which was unlit and often used for dumping trash. As they approached the scene they found a 1967 Ford van parked on a dirt road near some bushes. After hearing rustling noises coming from the bushes they ordered the person making the noise to come out. Zettlemoyer emerged from the woods holding a handgun and a flashlight. He claimed he had been shooting rats, but the officers were not convinced. Zettlemoyer was ordered to drop the gun and was then secured.[5]\nOne of the officers searched the area and came across the body of 29-year-old Charles DeVetsco.[6][7] He had been shot a total of four times. It later emerged he had been shot twice in the van while handcuffed and was then dragged from the van to the woods where two more fatal shots were fired. The cause of death was confirmed as a massive hemorrhaging of the heart, which had been penetrated by .357 magnum bullets.[5]\nDeVetsco had worked with Zettlemoyer at a retail store and had been scheduled to testify against him in an upcoming robbery trial in Snyder County. In May 1980, Zettlemoyer and an accomplice, Kenneth Kipple, had carried out a robbery, in which they had bound a security guard at a RadioShack near Sunbury and had stolen electronic equipment worth thousands of dollars. Kipple was later caught trying to sell the equipment and had named Zettlemoyer as his partner.[8] Zettlemoyer had then confided in DeVetsco about the heist. DeVetsco contacted the authorities and had planned to testify against him. Zettlemoyer had kidnapped DeVetsco near Selinsgrove and had driven him to Harrisburg to kill him in order to prevent his testimony.[9]\nOn April 24, 1981, Zettlemoyer was convicted of first degree murder and was sentenced to death.[10] After spending fourteen years on death row, Zettlemoyer fired his lawyers and dropped his efforts to live. He begged the courts to let him die because he claimed \"brain disease\" was making his life hell.[11] Doctors reported that Zettlemoyer was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. Lawyers for the Pennsylvania Post-Conviction Defender Organization argued that Zettlemoyer was not mentally competent, however, three psychiatrists testified he was sane. DeVetsco's mother also argued that Zettlemoyer was mentally ill and was, therefore, not competent to be executed for the murder of her son.[12][13]\nOn February 28, 1995, Governor Tom Ridge, who had made carrying out the death penalty a campaign issue, signed his first three death warrants. One of the warrants was for Zettlemoyer, who was scheduled to be executed on May 2.[14]\nZettlemoyer was executed by lethal injection on May 2, 1995, at State Correctional Institution \u2013 Rockview. His last meal was two cheeseburgers, french fries, chocolate pudding and chocolate milk.[15] He became the first person to be executed by the state of Pennsylvania since the resumption of the death penalty in 1976 and the first inmate put to death in Pennsylvania in thirty-three years.[16][17] He remains the first of only three people to be executed in Pennsylvania since the resumption of the death penalty.[18] The others were Leon Moser in August 1995 and Gary M. Heidnik in 1999.[19]\n",

Miranda Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in September 2014.[1] The murder is notable because of the unsubstantiated claim by one of the killers, Miranda Barbour, that she had murdered at least 22 other people, triggering worldwide news coverage of the case.[2]\nThe couple met Troy LaFerrara through an ad on Craigslist, where Miranda offered to have sex with him in exchange for payment.[3][4] Elytte has publicly denied that Miranda is a sex worker. He said that she met men that paid her for \"delightful conversation.\"[5] Miranda has stated that she agreed to meet LaFerrara for sex, charging $100.[6]\nOn November 11, 2013, Miranda allegedly met LaFerrara at the Susquehanna Valley Mall parking lot in Hummels Wharf, Pennsylvania. After settling on payment, Miranda and LaFerrara then drove six miles to Sunbury, a small city located about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia.[7] Elytte Barbour told police that he hid under a blanket in the back seat waiting.[8] After she allowed LaFerrara into her vehicle, Miranda signaled to Elytte, who jumped out and wrapped a cord around LaFerrara's neck as Miranda stabbed him 20 times in their Honda CR-V.[9] LaFerrara's body was discovered the next day, November 12, 2013, in a residential back yard in Sunbury.\nPolice said after Miranda and Elytte dumped LaFerrara's body, the couple then bought bleach wipes, towels, and cleaning liquid to remove the blood from inside the vehicle and then went to dinner. According to the arrest affidavit, Elytte said the couple killed LaFerrara because they just wanted to murder someone together.[10]\nAccording to police, the Barbours initially denied even knowing LaFerrara, but police traced the last call from LaFerrara's phone to Miranda's phone. As the investigation developed, the couple's stories allegedly changed from Miranda's story of self-defense to a mutual confession to premeditated murder.[11] The killing allegedly was a thrill killing, timed for three weeks after the couple's wedding, police have said.\nMiranda Barbour, 19, and Elytte Barbour, 22, pled not guilty to first-degree murder charges that carried a possible death penalty upon conviction. Both plead out to second-degree murder in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison.\nIn an interview with the Sunbury Daily Item, Miranda Barbour claimed she was molested by a relative at the age of four. Barbour's mother confirmed that Miranda's uncle was charged with sexual abuse of a minor and sentenced to 19 years in prison.[15] Barbour claimed that she joined a satanic cult at the age of 13 and soon after committed her first murder when the cult leader forced her to shoot a man indebted to their cult.[15] She claimed to be responsible for the deaths of \"at least 22 people\" between 2008 and 2013.[16][17]  This claim triggered worldwide media attention and led to investigations of the claim by the FBI and other police forces.[2]\nA Northumberland County District Attorney told The Daily Item that he was skeptical of Miranda's claims, saying \"We have been in contact with other law enforcement agencies where she has lived and haven't received any information verifying what she said.\"[18] The Alaska State Troopers released a statement saying they have no evidence Barbour committed any murders during her time in Alaska.[19]\nElytte Barbour graduated from Triton High School in 2010.[20]\nHe married Miranda (n\u00e9e Dean) on October 22, 2013 when they were residing in Dunn, North Carolina.[20][21]\n",

To date, he is the only member of the Forbes 400 richest Americans to be convicted of murder.[3]\nJohn du Pont was born on November 22, 1938, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the youngest of four children of William du Pont, Jr. and Jean Liseter Austin (1897\u20131988). He grew up at Liseter Hall, a mansion built in 1922 in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, by his maternal grandfather on more than 80 hectares (200 acres) of land given to his parents at their wedding by his maternal grandfather.[4] Both his parents' families had emigrated from Europe to the United States at the beginning of the 19th century and became highly successful.\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, du Pont's parents acquired more land and developed Liseter Hall Farm for Thoroughbred breeding, showing, and racing. His mother retained Liseter Hall Farm after the couple divorced in 1941. She added a dairy herd of Guernseys and bred Welsh ponies at the farm. John was aged 2 when his parents divorced. He had two older sisters, Jean and Evelyn; an older brother, Henry E. I. du Pont; and a younger half brother, William du Pont III, born of their father's second marriage.\nDu Pont graduated from Haverford School in 1957. He attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he belonged to the Zeta Psi fraternity, but withdrew before completing his freshman year.[5] He later attended college in Miami, Florida, where he studied under and was mentored by scientist Oscar T. Owre.[6] He graduated from the University of Miami in 1965 with a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology. He went on to complete a doctorate in natural science from Villanova University in 1973.[7]\nDuring an October 2015 podcast, Mark Schultz revealed that when du Pont was about thirty years old, a horse he was riding threw him onto a fence, resulting in injury to his testicles. They became infected and had to be removed, resulting in androgynous characteristics for the remainder of his life.[8]\nDuring his graduate work, du Pont participated in several scientific expeditions to study and identify species of birds in the Philippines and South Pacific. As an ornithologist, du Pont is credited with the discovery of two dozen species of birds.[9] He founded the Delaware Museum of Natural History in 1957.[10] As a young man, he served on the board, helping guide the institution toward opening in 1972. After having been part of scientific expeditions, he served as director of the museum for many years.[11]\n",

His easygoing and relaxing style belied a lifelong battle with depression.[1] Garroway has been honored for his contributions to radio and television with a star for each on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and the St. Louis Walk of Fame,[2] the city where he spent part of his teenaged years and early adulthood.[3]\nBorn in Schenectady, New York, Garroway was of Scottish descent.[4]  By the time Garroway was 14, he had moved with his family 13 times, finally settling in St. Louis, Missouri, where he attended University City High School and Washington University in St. Louis, from which he earned a degree in abnormal psychology.[5][6] Before going into broadcasting, Garroway worked as a Harvard University lab assistant, book salesman, and piston ring salesman.[7] After not being able to successfully sell either, Garroway decided to try his hand in radio.[8]\nGarroway began his broadcasting career at NBC as a page in 1938; he graduated 23rd in a class of 24 from NBC's school for announcers.[9] Following graduation, he landed a job at Pittsburgh radio station KDKA in 1939.[6] As a station reporter, he filed reports from a hot-air balloon,  a U.S. Navy submarine in the Ohio River, and deep inside a coal mine. His early reporting efforts earned Garroway a reputation for finding a good story, even in unusual places.[8]  The \"Roving Announcer\", as he was known, worked his way up to become the station's special-events director, while still attending to his on-air work.[10][11]  After two years with KDKA, Garroway left for Chicago.[12]\nWhen the United States entered World War II in 1941, Garroway enlisted in the U.S. Navy.  While stationed in Honolulu, he hosted a radio show when he was off duty, playing jazz records and reminiscing about the old days back in Chicago.[1] After the war, Garroway went to work as a disc jockey at WMAQ (AM) in Chicago.[9][13] Over time, Garroway hosted a series of radio programs, such as The 11:60 Club, The Dave Garroway Show, and Reserved for Garroway.[8][14] One oddity Garroway introduced on his radio shows was having the studio audience respond to a song number not by applauding, but by snapping their fingers.[15] Garroway also worked to organize jazz concerts, creating  a \"Jazz Circuit\" of local clubs in 1947, bringing back interest in this music genre.[16][17] His fellow disc jockeys voted him the nation's best in the 1948 and 1949 Billboard polls.[18][19] He won the award again in 1951.[20]\nGarroway was the first \"communicator\" on NBC Radio's Monitor when the program first aired on June 12, 1955.[21] He continued as the Sunday-evening host of the news and music program from 1955 to 1961.[22] Garroway worked on the air at WCBS radio in 1964 and briefly hosted the afternoon rush-hour shift at KFI in Los Angeles in late 1970 and early 1971.[23][24]\nGarroway was introduced to the national television audience when he hosted the experimental musical variety show Garroway at Large, telecast live from Chicago.[25] It was carried by NBC from June 18, 1949, to June 24, 1951.[26][27][28][29]\nGarroway's relaxed, informal style when on the air became part of his trademark. In 1960, reviewer Richard F. Shepard of The New York Times wrote, \"He does not crash into the home with the false jollity and thunderous witticisms of a backslapper. He is pleasant, serious, scholarly looking, and not obtrusively convivial.\" On television, Garroway was known for his signoff, saying \"Peace\" with an upraised palm.[30]\nAlong with Arthur Godfrey, Arlene Francis, Steve Allen, and Jack Paar, Garroway was one of the pioneers of the television talk show. Television commentator Steven D. Stark traces the origins of the style to Chicago.[31] Garroway, Studs Terkel, and Hugh Downs all hosted relaxed, garrulous, extemporaneous shows in that city in the early 1950s. Earlier radio and television voices spoke with an authoritative \"announcer's\" intonation, resembling public oration, often dropping about a musical fifth on the last word of a sentence. Garroway was one of the broadcasters who introduced conversational style and tone to television, beginning some broadcasts as though the viewer were sitting in the studio with him, as in this November 20, 1957, introduction for the Today show: \"And how are you about the world today? Let's see what kind of shape it's in; there is a glimmer of hope.\"\nPioneering NBC president Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver chose Garroway as the host of his new morning news-and-entertainment experiment, the Today show, in 1952.[32] He was joined by news editor Jim Fleming and announcer Jack Lescoulie when the show debuted on Monday, January 14, 1952.[33] Though initially panned by critics, Garroway's style attracted a large audience that enjoyed his easygoing presence early in the morning.[34][35] His familiar \"cohost\", a chimpanzee with the puckish name of J. Fred Muggs, did not hurt his genial manner, but his concurrent seriousness in dealing with news stories and ability to clearly explain abstract concepts earned him the nickname \"The Communicator\" and eventually won praise from critics and viewers alike.[9]\n",

Gosnell was convicted of the murders of three infants who were born alive after using drugs to induce birth, was convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of one woman during an abortion procedure, and was convicted of several other medically related crimes.[3][4][5][6][7]\nGosnell, based in the Mantua neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned and operated the Women's Medical Society Clinic, a non-compliant abortion clinic that was dubbed a \"house of horrors\" during the trial.[8] He was a prolific prescriber of OxyContin.[9] In 2011, Gosnell, his wife Pearl, and eight employees were charged with a total of 32 felonies and 227 misdemeanors in connection with deaths, illegal medical services, and regulatory violations. Pearl and the eight employees pleaded guilty to various charges in 2011 while Gosnell pleaded not guilty and sought a jury trial.[10]\nIn May 2013, Gosnell was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of three of the infants and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, an adult patient at the clinic following an abortion procedure. Gosnell was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour informed consent law. After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.[11][12] Gosnell was sentenced to an additional 30 years in prison for federal drug charges.[13]\nGosnell was born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the only child of a gas station operator and a government clerk[14] in an African-American family.[15] He was a student at the city's Central High School from which he graduated in 1959.[16][17] Gosnell initially attended the University of Pennsylvania,[18] then graduated from Dickinson College with a bachelor's degree.[19] He received his medical degree at the Thomas Jefferson University in 1966.[16]\nIt has been reported that Gosnell spent four decades practicing medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and a teen aid program.[16] He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua.[14][20] Gosnell told The Philadelphia Inquirer in October 1972: \"As a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them.\"[21]\nThat same year, Gosnell also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental \"Super Coil\" method invented by Harvey Karman. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. However, complications from the procedure were reported by nine of the women, with three of these reporting severe complications.[22][23]\nThe 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a \"respected man\" in his community, and a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce's \"Young Philadelphian of the Year\" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House.[21] By the late 1980s, however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien.[21]\nGosnell has been married three times. His third and current wife, Pearl, had worked at the Women's Medical Society as a full-time medical assistant from 1982 until their marriage in 1990.[1]  They have two children.[24] Gosnell has four other children from his two previous marriages.[24] In covering his background, media commentators drew attention to the \"incredibly diverse\" portrayals of Gosnell, touching on both his community works \u2013 the creation of the halfway house and teen aid program \u2013 contrasted with portrayals of his practice as an abortion mill in which viable fetuses and babies were routinely killed following illegal late-term procedures.[16]\n",

Daugherty, who was mentally disabled, was tortured and murdered before being wrapped in Christmas decorations, put inside a garbage can, and dumped in the parking lot of Greensburg-Salem Middle School.\nAmber Meidinger met Melvin Knight at a homeless shelter in Washington in January 2010. They moved to several locations before settling in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where they met Jennifer Daugherty.[1] Knight met Ricky Smyrnes after meeting previously in jail.[2]\nMelvin L. Knight (born October 27, 1989)[3] was born to a drug-addicted father who was imprisoned during the early years of his life. He developed lifelong learning and social problems after he fell out of a moving vehicle and hit his head at age 5.[4]\nAngela Lynn Marinucci (born July 14, 1992),[3] according to testimony by her mother and half-sister, Marinucci suffered a head injury when she was hit by a truck in 2008, at the age of 15. The injury substantially altered her behavior and pushed her into a downward spiral that ended with Daugherty\u2019s death, according to the defense. Two mental experts testified that Marinucci as a child, suffered from depression and that she may have had drug and alcohol addictions as a teenager.[5]\nMeidinger told jurors, \"at some point, she [Daugherty] trusted me because she knew me from the West Place (a center for people with special needs).\" Meidinger testified she and her then-boyfriend and co-defendant Melvin Knight met Smyrnes on February 8, 2010, after she and Knight had been staying at a Greensburg-area hotel. Knight and Smyrnes knew each other after meeting in jail, and Meidinger was pregnant with Knight's child when all three met up. Smyrnes offered Meidinger and Knight to stay at his apartment at 428 N. Pennsylvania Avenue in Greensburg.[6]\nRicky Ven Edward Smyrnes (born March 6, 1986)[3] was born to a drug-addicted Philadelphia sex worker and a Pittsburgh gang member. He was moved into and out of foster homes as a child and was treated for mental health disorders as early as age 4. He suffered abuse and neglect until he was taken in by the Smyrnes family in North Huntingdon at age 10, according to testimony by forensic psychologist Alice Applegate.[7] His lawyer, Terri Fayes, told the jury that Smyrnes suffered sexual and physical abuse from his father and his uncle. She also explained how he had tried beer, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana by age 6, had been diagnosed with PTSD at age 8, and had undergone 103 therapy sessions by age 10. She added he was diagnosed as having as many as seven different personalities, and 15 total psychiatric issues. In 1997, he burglarized his neighbor's home and stole knives, guitars, coins, bullets, and cash. That same year, he sexually assaulted a woman in her basement.[8]\nAccording to a testimony by Meidinger, the group went through her purse and stole money, gift cards, and her cell phone. They poured liquids into her bag, hit her head with filled soda bottles, cut her hair, painted her face with nail polish, and dumped liquid and spices on her head. Meidinger said she and Angela Marinucci took turns violently hitting Daugherty with a metal towel rack and crutches. She also noted that Daugherty was stripped naked, gagged, and raped by Knight.[1] They also forced her to consume feces, urine, and detergent.[9][10] Meidinger also said Knight took Daugherty to the living room where Marinucci poured a bottle of water over Daugherty's head and Knight and Smyrnes dumped oatmeal and spices on her head. Daugherty said that her eyes were burning, and Smyrnes told her to take a shower because she smelled bad.[2]\nAccording to her relatives, Daugherty had the mental abilities of an adolescent, trusted everyone, and thought that the suspects were her \"friends.\"[11]\n",

This period of increased racial unrest followed a period of significant racial tension, rioting and racial justice protests that were taking place in multiple cities across Pennsylvania and nation, during and after the Civil rights movement \u2014 actions that had endeavored to abolish multiple forms of legalized institutional racism in the United States through primarily nonviolent methods between 1954 and 1968.[1][2][3][4]\nRacial tensions began to escalate in York, Pennsylvania in 1963.[5][6] Black citizens of York protested police violence and discrimination at City Hall. Their demands for a biracial police review board were turned down by the all-white city council.[7] Citizens continued to protest over the next few years and complained of police brutality and the use of police dogs to curb protests. During this time, the city saw the rise of several notorious all-white gangs. By the mid-1960s, York had become deeply racially divided, and in 1968 a series of white-on-black crimes incited retaliation in the form of fire-bombings and street brawls.\nOn July 17, 1969, with racial tensions at the boiling point, a black youth who burned himself playing with lighter fluid blamed a local white gang known as the Girarders. That would later be revealed as a lie, but not before the pent-up resentments of the black community turned violent. That same day, seventeen-year-old Taka Nii Sweeney was shot by an unseen gunman when York City Police Detective George Smith stopped him and his friends for violating the city's youth curfew. White and black gangs began fighting that afternoon. Eleven others were hurt when people in six blocks of the city reverted to rock-throwing, barricading and shooting from behind bushes and poles.\nFighting lasted through the night and into the next day. Nine more people were injured, including Officer Henry C. Schaad. Schaad, a twenty-two-year-old rookie with eleven months on the force, was struck by a bullet believed to have been fired by a black rioter while riding in one of the police department's two armored trucks. White gangs around the city prepared for revenge. Schaad languished in the hospital for nearly two weeks before succumbing to his injuries.\nAs Schaad lay dying, racial tension soared in the city. Fights broke out, buildings were set ablaze and police began barricading black neighborhoods. More than sixty people were injured, one hundred were arrested, and entire city blocks were burned.\nOn July 21, Lillie Belle Allen, a black woman from Aiken, South Carolina who was visiting York with her parents, was riding in a car driven by her sister, Hattie Dickson. Dickson turned the car onto North Newberry Street and was looking for a grocery store when she saw a man with a gun leaning out of a second-story window. Multiple members of two all-white gangs, the Newberry Street Boys and the Girarders, were on the street that night, and many of them were armed.\n",

        "paragraph": "James David Martin (born December 11, 1971) is an American serial killer who strangled three people across three states between 1989 and 2005. While serving a sentence for the murder of his wife in Pennsylvania, he was connected via DNA profiling to a cold case murder in The Bronx, for which he was later given an additional 20 years imprisonment.[1]\nLittle is known about Martin's early life. According to the detectives who interviewed him, when he was about six years old, his mother beat his little sister to death. Following this event, James was sent to live in Fort Meade, Maryland, where he attended Meade Senior High School.[2] While a student there, he was on the basketball team, where he got acquainted with 15-year-old Michael Eugene Thomas, who would later become his first victim.\nAt age 17, Martin was envious that his fellow basketball buddy Thomas had recently bought himself an expensive pair of Air Jordans worth $115.50. On May 2, 1989, James lured Michael into the woods near the school, where he proceeded to sodomize and then strangle him to death. After killing him, he stole the Air Jordans and fled the scene. Not long after, however, he was arrested for the murder, charged with first-degree murder and convicted. The senseless crime for the shoes, which ironically did not even fit Martin,[3] were featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, with professional basketball player Michael Jordan himself expressing his horror at the brutality of the crime.[4] Martin served seven years in prison, before being released in 1996 and moving back to New York City to live with his mother.\nOn February 23, 1998, while walking around the Bronx, Martin came across 14-year-old Marleny Cruz, a Dominican-born adoptee who often went on visits to an aunt in the area. Taking an interest in the beautiful young girl, James asked her out on a date to his mother's apartment, to which she agreed. At some point, however, the pair began arguing, with Martin proceeding to grab her by the throat, beating, sexually abusing and finally, strangling Cruz to death.[2] He then dumped her body on a curb in University Heights,[1] where she was later found by passers-by. Initially, she could not be identified, and it was even presumed that she could have been Chante Smalls, a girl who had recently gone missing, but it was later determined not to be the case, as Smalls was later found alive.[2] Eight months later, through dental records, the body was identified as that of Cruz, but her killer remained elusive. Some detectives theorized that her death might have been related to a series of rapes that occurred in the Bronx at the time, but no conclusive connection was made to any such case.[3]\nFive months after the Cruz murder, Martin was arrested for groping a junkie and possession of crack cocaine. He was jailed for a year and then released. Not long after, he lured a 17-year-old male relative on a rooftop in the Bronx, where he attempted to strangle the boy with the laces from his sweatpants. The relative lapsed into unconsciousness, with Martin stabbing him in the neck with a knife, stealing $30 and then fleeing. Miraculously, the boy survived his injuries and managed to reach a hospital. When he was visited by his family, he pleaded with them not to let James in, as he was sure he would \"finish [him] off.\" At that moment, James walked in, and although he was arrested on the spot, he was allowed to plead guilty to attempted robbery and sentenced to five years imprisonment.[2]\nWhile in prison, he communicated with 30-year-old Cicela Santiago, who would become his girlfriend and later, his wife. After his release, the couple moved to Allentown, Pennsylvania, where, three months later, he strangled Cicela to death after she threatened to leave him. Martin dumped her body in a parking lot trash bin near the mall, where she was soon found.[2]\nMartin was swiftly arrested following the discovery of his wife's body, pleading guilty and receiving a sentence of 22-to-44 years imprisonment, which he would serve at the State Correctional Institution \u2013 Somerset prison. While serving his sentence there, his DNA was matched to that of an unidentified male's found underneath the fingernails of Marleny Cruz, and detectives from the Bronx were dispatched to question him. He freely admitted his guilt in the murder, and extradited back to New York City to stand trial on charges of murder, rape and sodomy.[2] On October 28, 2016, James David Martin plead guilty to her murder, and received an additional 20 years imprisonment, to be served on top of his previous sentence.[1]\n",

At 12:10\u00a0a.m., he sent out links to multiple files and videos which detailed his plans via his Twitter account; these files were labeled \"Journal\", \"Suicide Tapes\", and \"Digital set\".[2][3][4]\nStair then went back to the crew area in the rear of the store, blocked the remaining exits, then locked the automatic doors at the main entrance to the store. He then pulled out two pistol grip pump-action shotguns that he had concealed in a duffel bag[5] and walked around the store and killed three employees\u2014Victoria Brong, Brian Hayes, and Terry Lee Sterling. He then approached another coworker, Kristan Newell, who had not heard the shooting due to her listening to music with headphones on while she was labeling items and stocking shelves near the rear of the store.[6] Stair was seen on CCTV surveillance camera footage standing behind Newell as she worked for about five seconds before he proceeded to the next aisle.[7]\nAfter this, Stair proceeded to fire at a glass and other merchandise in the store and shot multiple small portable propane tanks, which failed to explode.   Around this time, Newell was able to escape the store by removing the display at the entry doors and breaking the glass door. She then ran outside and hid behind some bushes and called 911.\nAfter a short time, Stair concluded his shooting of the store's contents. Stair then went to the deli section of the store, and shot another group of items. Whilst Newell was on the phone to the police, Stair placed the loaded shotgun in his mouth and fired a single round through his palate, killing himself instantly. A total of 59 shots had been fired. All of the shotgun rounds fired came from only one of the two shotguns he brought. Stair stated in his fifth \"Suicide Tape\" that the second shotgun was only for backup in case the first one \"breaks down on [him] or jams, and [he has] no way of fixing it\".\nAll three were employed by Weis Markets\nRandy Robert Stair (September 17, 1992 \u2013 June 8, 2017), who called himself Andrew Blaze, worked at Weis Markets for seven years prior to the shootings. He had kept detailed videos, recordings, and journals leading up to the shooting, most of which he uploaded to online forums and social media profiles just prior. In these writings and videos, he expressed his willingness to commit suicide, addressed the personal tragedies and other misfortunes he experienced which led him to a state of depression, described cross-dressing and questioning his gender identity, provided detailed explanations of his plans for carrying out the shooting, and explained his belief that these murders would allow him to cross over to an animated world he had imagined. Stair also had a fascination with multiple mass shootings, specifically school shootings (particularly the Columbine High School massacre and its perpetrators). In his writings, Stair called the Columbine shooters his heroes, wishing he could have met them, and said Eric was his idol out of the two boys.[10][11][12]\nFrom 2007, Stair had a presence on YouTube with his channel PioneersProductions, which featured short sketches and collaborations he had done with other content creators.[4] By 2014, however, he announced that he was going in a different direction with his content, citing numerous unfortunate events that had occurred in his life during the previous year; this led to the creation of Ember's Ghost Squad (EGS), a fan-based animated series focused on a fictional organization based on the Nickelodeon animated series Danny Phantom due to his obsession with the character Ember McLain.[citation needed]\nOn the evening of June 7, 2017, Stair uploaded a final video titled \"The Westborough High Massacre\" hours before perpetrating the shooting. In it, he described his hatred towards the people involved with the series through an angry prologue. It then featured a crudely animated sequence depicting him and one of the characters from EGS murdering students at a fictional high school, before ending with montages of previous videos explaining the motives behind the shooting.[13] He also managed nine Twitter accounts based on his characters, where he left links to journals and videos he uploaded on MediaFire.[14] He was living in nearby Dallas, Pennsylvania, with his parents and had lived in Pennsylvania all of his life.[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Foundation for New Era Philanthropy was a Ponzi scheme that operated from 1989 until its collapse in 1995 after having raised over $500 million from 1100 donors and embezzling $135 million of this. Most of the money was stolen from Christian religious organizations and charities in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area. The scheme was publicly discovered by Albert Meyer, an accounting teacher at a Spring Arbor College[1] and the auditing firm Coopers & Lybrand working with its client, a local religious college in Los Angeles who suffered no loss in its participation.[2]\nThe Foundation was founded by John G. Bennett Jr., a prominent Christian businessman[3] from the Philadelphia area who had previously run a variety of different entities, including some Pennsylvania state drug education centers and a corporate training business.\nIn 1989, Bennett invited several Christian friends to become \"beneficiary donors\" in a new organization he was founding.[3] They were told that if they contributed at least $5,000 for three months, he would double it. He explained that he had identified secret donors who would match charitable contributions raised by his friends. So rather than donating $5,000 to charity, a sponsor gave the money to New Era Philanthropy for three months, then he or she could donate $10,000.[citation needed]\nHis friends obliged by giving him various amounts, which Bennett used to pay his bills. He was able to pay them their doubled funds in January 1990 by tapping a payment made to a consulting business he ran on the side. This was the last \"real\" income paid to investors. To have funds ready to pay off the climbing number of deposits, he increased the minimum \"contribution\" to $25,000 and lengthened the minimum waiting period. Different donors were told different things; over time the waiting period grew from six to nine to ten months. The number of anonymous donors, anonymous benefactors, and anonymous philanthropists also varied, though Bennett eventually settled on claiming to have nine of them.[citation needed]\nJohn M. Templeton, Jr., son of John Templeton, Sr., the famous investor and philanthropist, was a friend of Bennett, and people believed that he was one of the anonymous donors. In addition, Prudential Securities was a prominent part of the setup (and became the subject of a $90 million lawsuit accusing them of complicity).\nIn 1994, Bennett expanded the program to allow \"donations\" by nonprofit organizations.\nThe program remained small until 1993, when the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences asked for a quarter-million dollar match. After successfully completing that match, many major organizations such as the Philadelphia Public Library and the University of Pennsylvania joined, along with churches and other Christian organizations. Like most modern pyramid or Ponzi schemes, Bennett's was an \"affinity\" scheme, in which he defrauded people of common interest: in this case, local nonprofit organizations and Christian charities.  Using the swelling funds from these churches, Bennett expanded further, establishing offices in Radnor, Pennsylvania. He had glossy brochures and a staff to process all the money coming in.\nHe expanded his sales force by encouraging organizations to take a \"finder's fee\" of 10% from any money they raised. In other words, if a representative could convince donors to give $10,000,000, the agent could keep $1,000,000 for himself, give the remaining $9,000,000 to New Era and get back $18,000,000 for the nonprofit in six months. And to further increase inflows, in 1993 Bennett started allowing the organizations to donate to themselves, often out of their endowment funds.[3] The directors of the charities who handed over their endowments to New Era were then rewarded with finder's fees.\nBy and large his donors did not ask many questions. When they wanted proof that the money they donated was not being stolen, he provided evidence that the Foundation owned government bonds. However, he was showing the same bonds to everybody, and they had been pledged as collateral on loans anyway. He also had prospective participants speak with supposed representatives of Prudential Bache Securities. Later review showed that the Foundation's tax returns, which had always been publicly available, did not reflect the numerous funds supposedly held by New Era. New Era used a small one-man CPA firm; later review by Coopers & Lybrand identified erroneous financial opinions by this firm as potential red flags.\n",

        "paragraph": "Busted: A Tale of Corruption and Betrayal in the City of Brotherly Love is a 2014 non-fiction book by Wendy Ruderman and Barbara Laker. The book details the true tale of how Ruderman and Laker, two reporters at the Philadelphia Daily News, led an investigation into police corruption in Philadelphia. This book shows the back story of the \"Tainted Justice\" investigation which earned the women a Pulitzer Prize in 2010 for investigative reporting.\nAt the time of the investigation, the newspaper was in deep financial trouble. The company, which also owns the Philadelphia Inquirer, only had one lawyer at the time. The lawyer was bogged down with other legal proceedings and was unable to offer too much help to the women. So instead, when the city refused to give them access to search warrants, Ruderman and Laker convinced the custodian of the records on Christmas Eve to let them access the records.[1]\nThe investigation was quite the controversy in Philadelphia. In part, that was because several police officers died in the line of duty leading up to the investigation, which made people already more sensitive to police at that time.[1]\nAfter the investigation trickled out through the tabloid over a few months, hundreds of drug cases in the city had been re-examined out and some were thrown out. Philadelphia police also launched a task force with the FBI, the department's Internal Affairs division and the city's Inspector General's Office, to investigate the incidents.[2] As of May 10[when?], five officers involved with the allegations were on desk duty and more than 15 civil suits had been filed in federal court.\nFederal and local prosecutors decided not to press any charges against the four officers who were accused of lying about evidence on search warrants and stealing from corner drug stores\u2014one of the officers was accused of sexually assaulting at least three women.[3]\nIn July 2014, the president of Philadelphia's Fraternal Order of Police, John McNesby, demanded an investigation into how Ruderman and Laker interacted with the sources used during their \"Tainted Justice\" investigation. According to a NewsWorks report at the time, McNesby suggested that the reporters \"may have given money, paid utility bills and provided diapers to sources who accused the offers at the center of the 2009 series.\"[4] McNesby said the Pulitzer Prize should be revoked from the women.\nA video[5] from a staff member at the Daily News shows the two women jumping wildly up and down after learning they had won. Ruderman is seen opening a small bottle of champagne, pouring it into her tennis shoe and drinking it.[6] She later called this a reference to \"shoe leather\" journalism.\n\nRosella Elanor Lafevre praised the book in a review for the Philadelphia magazine, writing:It\u2019s a captivating story that I tore through in two days. There are moments that inspire riotous laughter and quiet awe, and some that will make your skin crawl. It gives as much proof to the importance of hard-working reporters in a one-party town as it does the importance of chasing your dreams, even when they seem preposterous.[7]",

        "paragraph": "Flight 93 is a 2006 American drama television film directed by Peter Markle and written by Nevin Schreiner, which chronicles the events onboard United Airlines Flight 93 during the September 11 attacks in 2001. It premiered on January 30, 2006, on A&E, and was re-broadcast several times throughout 2006.\nThe film stars Jeffrey Nordling, Colin Glazer, Brennan Elliott, Ty Olsson, Jacqueline Ann Steuart, Laura Mennell, Karen Holness, Barry W. Levy, Biski Gugushe, and Dominic Rains.\nThe film was rated PG-13 for some violence and emotional depiction during the hijack situation.\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, First officer LeRoy Homer Jr. gets dressed in his F.A.A.[clarification needed] official uniform, kisses his wife and leaves for work. Passengers board United Airlines Flight 93 at Newark Liberty International Airport, including Tom Burnett, Jeremy Glick, Todd Beamer, Mark Bingham, Lauren Grandcolas, Donald Greene, Nicole Miller, and Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Four al-Qaeda terrorists Ziad Jarrah, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami, also board the flight. The plane takes off from Newark, bound for San Francisco, California.\n46 minutes after takeoff, the hijackers make their move; passenger Mark Rothenberg tries to negotiate with the hijackers and is fatally stabbed and the \"bomb\" is revealed causing mass panic among passengers, the hijackers stab a flight attendant knocking her unconscious before wrestling their way into the cockpit and attacking the pilots. During the struggle with the hijackers, Homer courageously sends out a mayday call before he and Captain Jason Dahl are knocked unconscious. Within minutes, Flight 77 crashes into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia.\nAboard Flight 93, the passengers learn from family members via airphones about the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C.; they decide to take action by organizing a revolt against the four hijackers. Their plan is empowered with the knowledge that passenger Don Greene has experience in flying.\nThe group pins their hopes on Greene being able at least to control the plane. After passengers arm themselves, pray, and make final phone calls to loved ones, Todd Beamer says, \"Let's Roll!\". They start their counter-attack, running down the aisle with a food cart. Jarrah shakes the plane violently to throw the passengers off balance, and Flight 93 narrowly misses a private aircraft as the passengers continue their assault, overpowering al-Nami, who is outside the cockpit. After boiling water is thrown at him, al-Nami is killed by Mark Bingham with a blow to the head with the hot water container. Seeing the passengers getting nearer, al-Ghamdi, Jarrah and al-Haznawi prepare to crash the plane, knowing they'll never reach their intended target. The passengers breach the cockpit with the food cart, and as they wrestle with al-Haznawi and al-Ghamdi to get in the cockpit, the two hijackers tell Jarrah to simply crash the plane, rather than to carry on with the rest of their mission. Jarrah puts it into a nosedive, just as the passengers finally gain entrance into the cockpit. The plane inverts, crashing into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing everyone on board. Air Traffic Control can be seen and heard desperately calling for any response from Flight 93. Emergency workers then come by to investigate the crash area (denoted by the crater). The film then depicts the passage of time, and with it, the disappearance of the crater.\nThe film received the award for \"Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special\" at the 2006 Emmy Awards.[1]\nThe DVD version was released on June 26, 2006. It came in 3 languages, English, Arabic, and Japanese.\n",

A gunman went on a shooting rampage at a public meeting of township supervisors in the municipal building, leaving three people dead and three others injured. The gunman, identified as Rockne Warren Newell, was described as having long feuded with township officials.\nWhile approaching the building on foot, Newell fired a .223 Ruger Mini-14 rifle into the building 28 times, through windows. Then, he went back to his car to retrieve a 6-shot .44 Magnum Revolver before entering the building and the meeting room. There, he began shooting the handgun at meeting attendees. While the gunman was still shooting, two men struggled with him over the gun. They subdued, disarmed, and held him, preventing further deaths and injuries.\nLinda Kozic, Frank Pirano, and Howard Beers were injured; while David Fleetwood, Gerard Kozic, and James \"Vinny\" LaGuardia were fatally wounded. During the struggle over the gun with Bernard Kozen and Mark Krashe, the gunman was wounded in the leg with his own weapon.[1][2][3]\nAttorneys William Ruzzo and Michael E. Weinstein were assigned to Newell's defense in August 2013,[4] and remained his attorneys for the duration of the trial. Newell pleaded guilty to three counts of first degree murder and attempted murder charges on May 29, 2015, and was sentenced to three life terms as well as an additional 61 to 122 years for the attempted murder charges and is currently imprisoned in the State Correctional Institution \u2013 Rockview[5][6]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nUnited Airlines Flight 93 was a domestic scheduled passenger flight that was hijacked by four al-Qaeda attackers aboard the plane on the morning of September 11, 2001, as part of the September 11 attacks. The plane eventually crashed in Somerset County, Pennsylvania following an attempt by the passengers and crew to regain control of the plane from the hijackers. All 44 people on board were killed, including the hijackers. The aircraft, a Boeing 757-222, was flying United Airlines' daily scheduled morning flight from Newark International Airport in New Jersey to San Francisco International Airport in California.\nThe hijackers stormed the aircraft's cockpit 46 minutes after takeoff. The captain and first officer struggled with the hijackers, which was transmitted to air traffic control. Ziad Jarrah, who had trained as a pilot, took control of the aircraft and diverted it back toward the east coast, in the direction of Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, considered principal instigators of the attacks, have claimed that the intended target was the U.S. Capitol Building.[1]\nSeveral passengers and flight attendants learned from phone calls that suicide attacks had already been made by hijacked airliners on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia. Rather than cede control of the plane, many of the passengers attempted to retake it from the hijackers. During the struggle, the plane crashed into a field near a reclaimed strip mine in Stonycreek Township, near Indian Lake and Shanksville, about 65 miles (105\u00a0km) southeast of Pittsburgh and 130 miles (210\u00a0km) northwest of Washington, D.C. A few people witnessed the impact from the ground, and news agencies began reporting the event within an hour.\nOf the four aircraft hijacked on September 11\u00a0\u2013 the others were American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, and American Airlines Flight 77\u00a0\u2013 United Airlines Flight\u00a093 was the only aircraft that did not reach its hijackers' intended target. A temporary memorial was built near the crash site soon after the attacks.[2] Construction of a permanent Flight 93 National Memorial was dedicated on September 10, 2011,[3] and a concrete and glass visitor center (situated on a hill overlooking the site)[4] was opened exactly four years later.[5]\nThe hijacking of Flight\u00a093 was led by Ziad Jarrah, a member of al-Qaeda.[6] Jarrah was born in Lebanon to a wealthy family and had a secular upbringing.[7] He intended to become a pilot and moved to Germany in 1996, enrolling at the University of Greifswald to study German.[8] A year later, he moved to Hamburg and began studying aeronautical engineering at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences.[9] In Hamburg, Jarrah became a devout Muslim and associated with the radical Hamburg cell.[9][10]\nIn November 1999, Jarrah left Hamburg for Afghanistan, where he spent three months.[11] While there, he met with al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in January 2000.[12] Jarrah returned to Hamburg at the end of January and in February obtained a new passport containing no stamped records of his travels by reporting his passport as stolen.[13][11]\nIn May, Jarrah received a visa from the U.S. Embassy in Berlin,[14] arriving in Florida in June 2000. There, he began taking flying lessons and training in hand-to-hand combat.[15][16] Jarrah maintained contact with his girlfriend in Germany and with his family in Lebanon in the months preceding the attacks.[17] This close contact upset Mohamed Atta, the tactical leader of the plot, and al-Qaeda planners may have considered another operative, Zacarias Moussaoui, to replace him if he had backed out.[18]\nFour \"muscle\" hijackers were trained to storm the cockpit and overpower the crew, and three accompanied Jarrah on Flight\u00a093. The first, Ahmed al-Nami, arrived in Miami, Florida, on May 28, 2001, on a six-month tourist visa with United Airlines Flight\u00a0175 hijackers Hamza al-Ghamdi and Mohand al-Shehri. The second, Ahmed al-Haznawi, arrived in Miami on June\u00a08 with Flight\u00a011 hijacker Wail al-Shehri. The third, Saeed al-Ghamdi, arrived in Orlando, Florida, on June 27 with Flight\u00a0175 hijacker Fayez Banihammad.[15] Ziad Jarrah's and Saeed al-Ghamdi's passports were recovered from the Flight 93 crash site.[19] Jarrah's family said he had been an \"innocent passenger\" on board the flight.[20]\n",

Carr, 22, sometimes lived in a cave and carried a .22 caliber rifle.[5] He asked Wight for a cigarette. She said she did not have one, and hurried back to the campsite, where she told Brenner that someone else was there. The couple dressed, and decided to find a more private campsite.\nThe couple encountered Carr again later that day, when they stopped to look at their map. Brenner and Wight eventually set up camp in a new location. They ate dinner, and began to have sex. Unseen by the couple, Carr watched them from 82 feet away.[6] He fired eight bullets at the women: Brenner was hit five times in the arm, face, head and neck;[7] Wight was shot twice in the head and back. The last shot shattered Wight's liver.[8] The eighth bullet missed.\nWight was unable to stand, so Brenner hiked four miles to the road, where she was able to get a ride to the Shippensburg police station.[9][10] When the police returned to the scene, they found that Wight had died from her wounds.\nCarr thought both women were dead. He left 25 rounds of ammunition at the scene, along with the knit cap he had worn; police found them at the scene. For ten days after the shooting, Carr hid in a Mennonite community.[11] Since members of the community did not read the news or watch television, they did not know Carr was a suspect in a shooting until one member, who had secretly watched television, recognized Carr from the composite drawing on the news and called police.\nPolice arrested Carr on a warrant from Florida for grand larceny.[12] Carr waived his right to a jury trial in exchange for an agreement by the prosecution not to seek the death penalty.[13] At trial, Carr claimed he had been enraged by the sight of the two women having sex, that the two women had taunted him by having sex in front of him. His public defender said he had been raped in a Florida prison, and sexually abused as a child. The attorney claimed that the couple's lesbianism was provocation that caused his client \"inexplicable rage.\"[14]\nThe judge refused to allow evidence of Carr's psychosexual history, ruling it irrelevant.[15] He also disallowed the introduction of Brenner's and Wight's relationship in court, thus forcing the defense to cut a deal and accept a sentence of life without parole.[16] On March 8, 1991, Carr's appeal, based on the court's decision to disallow introduction of his psychosexual history in court, was denied by the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.[17]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nChristopher Douglass Roney (born December 15, 1969), known by the stage name Cool C, is an American former rapper active in the late 1980s. He is also known for his involvement in the murder of Philadelphia Police officer Lauretha Vaird during a bank robbery in January 1996, for which he was sentenced to death. He is currently on death row.\nIn the mid-1980s, Roney was an original member of the Philadelphia-based Hilltop Hustlers hip hop crew. His 1987 debut single, \"Juice Crew Dis\", which took aim at the New York-based hip hop crew run by influential rap producer Marley Marl (a group that included Kool G Rap and Big Daddy Kane), gained Roney a good amount of attention.[1]\nA pair of 1988 singles for Hilltop and City Beat Records landed Roney a contract with Atlantic Records, where he released two full-length solo albums: his debut I Gotta Habit in 1989 and Life in the Ghetto in 1990. Both albums stayed on the Billboard 200 for numerous weeks.[2]\nIn 1991, Roney put his solo career aside to join hardcore hip hop group C.E.B. (which stood for \"Countin' Endless Bank\") with fellow Philadelphia rappers Warren McGlone (Steady B) and Ultimate Eaze. To disappointing sales and reviews, the trio released their only album, Countin' Endless Bank, on Ruffhouse Records in 1993. The single \"Get the Point\" reached number 5 on Billboard's Hot Rap Singles.[3]\nIn 1992, an independent label, Rags to Riches Records, released the single \"Get the Point.\" After extraordinary success with the single, Rags to Riches Records founders, Malik Abd-hadi and Bilal \"bilally b\" Salaam signed the trio Cool C, Steady B and Ultimate Eaze (C.E.B.) to Ruffhouse Records. At that point, Abd-hadi and Salaam became their managers. The project was short-lived mainly because Ultimate Eaze had legal troubles and never showed up for a promotional tour to promote the release of the first album on Ruffhouse. The group was dropped before Steady B, and Cool C got back off tour.[citation needed]\nOn January 2, 1996, during the same time period that he was recording a comeback EP,[4] Roney, along with C.E.B. bandmate McGlone (a.k.a. Steady B), and another local Philadelphia rapper, Mark Canty, attempted a bank robbery at a PNC bank branch in Feltonville. During the botched heist, Roney shot and killed Philadelphia Police officer Lauretha Vaird, who responded to the bank's silent alarm.[5][6] As he exited the bank, Roney exchanged fire with another police officer, before he and Canty dropped their weapons at the scene and fled in a stolen minivan driven by McGlone.[7][8]\nRoney was arrested on October 30, 1996, and convicted of first-degree murder.[5] At his subsequent sentencing hearing, Roney was sentenced to death by lethal injection. On January 10, 2006, his death warrant was signed by Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, and his execution date was set for March 9, 2006.[9] He was granted a stay of execution from Pennsylvania Judge Gary Glazer on February 1, 2006, until all post-conviction litigation is resolved.[10] His execution was set for January 8, 2015,[11] but Roney was once again granted a stay of execution from Pennsylvania Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo on December 5, 2014.[12]\nRoney has maintained his innocence throughout the trial and appeals process, despite the testimony of three eyewitnesses who placed him at the scene of the robbery, as well as ballistic and forensic evidence and surveillance video that linked him to the murder.[4][7] He is currently an inmate at the State Correctional Institution \u2013 Phoenix.[9] His inmate ID number is DF1973.[13]\n",

        "paragraph": "LaToyia Figueroa (January 26, 1981 \u2013 August 2005) was an American woman of African-American and Hispanic descent who was murdered in 2005.  Figueroa, who was five months pregnant at the time, was reported missing on July 18, 2005 after she failed to show up to work.  She was later found strangled to death after being featured on America's Most Wanted.[1]\nPolice discovered Figueroa's remains in a grassy, partially wooded lot in Chester, Pennsylvania, located 13 miles south of Philadelphia.  They arrested Stephen Poaches, the father of her unborn child, on August 20, more than a month after she was reported missing.[2]  On October 17, 2006, Poaches was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Figueroa and her unborn child.[3][4]\nThe disappearance and murder of Figueroa sparked controversy about media coverage because cable news channels, such as CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel, neglected to cover her story while focusing most of their attention on the case of Natalee Holloway, a Caucasian teen missing on the island of Aruba.[5] Some observers protested that Figueroa's case was similar to the Laci Peterson case (which also covered the same timespan) and thus deserved greater attention, implying that race was a factor in the lack of coverage.\nOn July 18, 2005, 24 years old and five months pregnant, LaToyia went to a prenatal checkup with the father of her unborn child, 25 year old Stephen Poaches. Afterward they went to his apartment.[6] Poaches later stated that LaToyia had left his home \"peaceably\" around 5pm however, LaToyia did not pick up her 7-year-old daughter that evening nor did she show up for her shift at the restaurant where she worked.[7]\nAfter she was reported missing, Poaches told police that he knew nothing about LaToyia's disappearance and did not participate in any search efforts. Poaches then called a radio station to defend himself against suspicion.[8]\nIn the weeks following her disappearance, detectives searched Poaches's home and car and found no evidence of a crime. Police also did not find any evidence of credit card use or cellphone activity by Latoyia and thus she was categorized by police officials as a missing person.[9] Her father, Melvin Figueroa organized on his own, search teams throughout the city for weeks following her disappearance.[10] As relatives and friends papered the city with flyers, a reward for information reached $100,000 which included donations from the restaurant where she worked and Philadelphia rapper, Beanie Sigel .[11] It was reported that police and the media took almost two weeks to focus any meaningful attention to her case prior to TV host Nancy Grace began to do nationally televised reporting on her disappearance.[12]\nWell over a month after her disappearance, police detectives received a tip from an acquaintance of Poaches stating that he had contacted them the evening prior asking to borrow a truck and inquiring about a body bag. Police then followed Poaches from his home to a grassy, partially wooded lot in Chester, 13 miles outside of Philadelphia.[13] He was wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying a gun. There police discovered LaToyia's remains.[14][15] Poaches was arrested and a judge ruled that prosecutors had enough evidence to try him on 2 counts of 1st degree murder for Latoyia and their unborn child. Police stated that Poaches had strangled Latoyia hours after returning from the pre-natal appointment.[16]\nAs of 2010 Stephen Poaches, Pennsylvania Department of Corrections #GV2311, is located in the State Correctional Institution \u2013 Houtzdale.[17]\nFigueroa's family stated that the lack of media coverage of her disappearance only brought more tragedy to an already troubled search. Figueroa's mother, Ann Taylor, was murdered when LaToyia was a toddler. Figueroa had a seven-year-old daughter.  Joseph Taylor, Figueroa's uncle and family spokesman, has actively criticized the media.  America's Most Wanted and the Philadelphia Citizen Crime Commission teamed up with police to aid in the search.  A $100,000 reward was funded by rap stars Beanie Sigel (while in a prison) and Damon Dash, Beneficial Bank, T.G.I. Fridays, local philanthropists Joe Mammanaand, Kal Rudman, and Internet bloggers to help the family in the search for LaToyia.[18][19]\n",

He was then given another ship, also called Morris\u00a0(1779), by Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez, the governor of Spanish Louisiana, to deal with British military shipping on Lake Pontchartrain.[2]  In September 1779 he captured a British ship.  He then took over command of the prize, HMS West Florida, with instructions from Oliver Pollock, Congress' agent in New Orleans, to assist G\u00e1lvez in a planned expedition to capture the West Florida port of Mobile. The ship was re-rigged and renamed G\u00e1lveztown. Following that successful expedition, he sailed on to Philadelphia, where the ship was sold.[3]\nPickles was then given command of Mercury, and charged with transporting Henry Laurens to the Dutch Republic on a diplomatic mission.  The ship was captured off the coast of Newfoundland, and while Laurens were imprisoned in London, Pickles was imprisoned in Mill Prison in Plymouth. Pickles escaped from Mill on May 16, 1781 and eventually returned to Philadelphia.[4]  He died in Philadelphia on September 9, 1783, after being assaulted by a gang of Italian sailors.[1]\nThe prosecution of his murderers was complicated by a legal question: whether statutes previously enacted by the British Parliament were still in force in the now independent state of Pennsylvania.[5]  Two of the sailors were sentenced on October 8, 1783, to hang ten days later.[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Gudgeonville Covered Bridge was an 84-foot (25.6\u00a0m) long Multiple King-post Truss covered bridge over Elk Creek in Girard Township, Erie County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It was built in 1868 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 17, 1980.[2] It was destroyed by arson on November 8, 2008.\nIt was the oldest of the three remaining covered bridges in Erie County. The bridge structure's sufficiency rating on the Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory was only 14.6\u00a0percent and its condition was deemed \"basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action\".\nThe Gudgeonville Bridge was constructed around 1868 and was rebuilt in the early 1870s after a fire. The bridge is located in Girard Township and crosses Elk Creek.  The bridge was built and designed by William Sherman. The foundation of the bridge is believed to be remnants of the Erie Extension Canal. The name of the bridge has been a mystery with some sources indicating that the bridge was constructed to provide access to a gudgeon factory.[3][4]\nThe bridge has been damaged from numerous small fires and has been the site of constant vandalism over the years.[5][6] There were several proposals to dismantle the bridge and move it to a more secure location where it would not be vandalized.[6] Another proposal was to build another bridge to bypass the original bridge, as it is too narrow to allow a variety of vehicles to cross it, including snowplows, fire trucks, and ambulances.[6]\nEvans' 2001 Pennsylvania's covered bridges: a complete guide described the bridge to be \"structurally sound,\" but its general appearance to be \"most disappointing\".[7] The Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory found the sufficiency rating[a] of the bridge structure to be only 14.6 percent.[1] It found that the bridge's foundations were determined to \"scour critical,\" meaning that the bridge's foundations were \"determined to be unstable for the calculated scour conditions,\" and that the railing \"does not meet currently acceptable standards\".[1] Its overall condition was deemed \"basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action\", with an estimated cost to improve the bridge of $107,000.[1]\nThe Gudgeonville Covered Bridge caught fire around 1:40\u00a0am local time on November 8, 2008.[8] The blaze was determined by the Pennsylvania State Police to have been an arson.[8] On December\u00a017, the State Police arrested two suspects after they confessed to dousing the bridge in gasoline and setting it on fire.[9] The suspects were also involved in several other incidents in northern Crawford County and western Erie County.[10] In August\u00a02009, one of the arsonists was convicted and sentenced to 5 to 10\u00a0years in prison for the destruction of the bridge and for an unrelated charge.[11] The other arsonist was sentenced to 5+1\u20442 to 14\u00a0years for the fire and for a string of other crimes.[12]\nThe remains of the bridge were lifted from its abutments and set in a nearby field and dismantled to allow for a temporary bridge to be built in its place on January 26.[13] The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) would not allow an exact replica of the covered bridge as it still would not be up to code. The temporary, prefabricated bridge was erected in August 2009, funded by an insurance policy held by the township.[14] The new bridge was needed quickly as a permanent, concrete bridge would have taken three years to design and build. Without a bridge, traffic would have had to make a 2-mile (3\u00a0km) detour.[14]\nThe following table is a comparison of published measurements of length, width and load recorded in different sources using different methods, as well as the name or names cited. NBI measures bridge length between the \"backwalls of abutments\" or pavement grooves and the roadway width as \"the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails\". The NRHP form was prepared by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission (PHMC), which surveyed county engineers, historical and covered bridge societies, and others for all the covered bridges in the commonwealth. The Evans visited every covered bridge in Pennsylvania in 2001 and measured each bridge's length (portal to portal) and width (at the portal) for their book. The data in Zacher's book was based on a 1991 survey of all covered bridges in Pennsylvania by the PHMC and PennDOT, aided by local government and private agencies. The article uses primarily the NBI and NRHP data, as they are national programs.\n* Listed mainspan length only\n",

        "paragraph": "The Philadelphia poison ring was a murder for hire gang led by Italian immigrant cousins, Herman and Paul Petrillo, in 1930s Philadelphia, where the Italian community had almost doubled in 20 years from 76,734 in 1910 (the year the Petrillos arrived in the country) to over 155,000 by 1930 - just before the murder ring began operations. The activities of the ring came to light in 1938 and the cousins were ultimately convicted of first degree murder and executed by electric chair in 1941.\nA Russian-Jewish immigrant gang member, Morris Bolber, known as 'Louie, the Rabbi', turned state's evidence. Gang members, associates and 'dupes' (many of them Italian-born, superstitious women, dubbed 'poison widows' by an excited press) were brought to trial and mostly convicted to death sentences (later commuted) or varying prison sentences. One or two were found not guilty, notably the widow Stella Alfonsi, whose husband's 1938 death by poison brought the case to light, and who was successfully defended by the lawyer Raymond Pace Alexander.\nHerman and Paul Petrillo were cousins. Herman was an expert counterfeiter and arsonist, with contacts in the criminal world, while Paul ran an insurance scam business from the back of his tailor's shop and aspired to a paid consultancy in 'la fattura', a magic believed in and resorted to by many in South Philadelphia's Italian community. The murders began in 1931, with Herman enlisting associate thugs to kill men he had arranged to insure, to collect on the double indemnity accident insurance.\nHerman ruthlessly and euphemistically described this as \"sending [them] to California\". Two victims, Ralph Caruso and Joseph Arena were both drowned and bludgeoned on separate fishing trips. While a third victim, John Woloshyn, was first bludgeoned and then repeatedly run over by a car. Meanwhile, Herman tried to steer clear of repeated attempts by the authorities to bring him to justice for insurance fraud, arson and currency counterfeiting.\nAs the Depression deepened, the Petrillos headed an informal gang, now including Morris Bolber and other self-styled 'fattuchierie' (wise women, witches) such as Maria Carina Favato, Josephine Sedita and Rose Carina, who offered superstitious, unhappily married, murderous or merely gullible women incantations, powders and potions to adjust their lives. These 'love potions' usually contained arsenic, or antimony, and they were invariably accompanied by excessive insurance policies on the victims, often made out in favour of gang members rather than the supposed 'poison widow' beneficiaries.\nThe gang embraced insurance agents and made highly successful use of the period's widespread cheap insurance policies, often taken out without medical examination (not required for policies under $500) or the knowledge of the principal concerned, who would subsequently meet an agonising death by arsenic, engineered by the spouse; possibly with intent, possibly in superstitious ignorance of their actions. This went on from 1932 until 1938, when the death of Ferdinando Alfonsi in a hospital brought matters into the open.\nVincent P. McDevitt was an Assistant District Attorney in Philadelphia. In early 1939, the District Attorney, Charles F. Kelley, assigned him to the homicide case of Ferdinando Alfonsi, who had died on 27 October 1938. McDevitt immediately had information from two undercover detectives, agents Landvoight and Phillips. From them, McDevitt had an informant, one George Meyer, who ran a local upholstery cleaning business.[1]\nMeyer encountered Herman Petrillo when he was trying to obtain money for his business. Petrillo had offered to provide him with a large sum of money in both legal tender and counterfeit, if Meyer would perform the hit on Alfonsi. Landvoight and Meyer had played along with the murder plot, with Meyer hoping for an advance pay-out and Landvoight hoping to finally bust Petrillo's counterfeiting crimes.[2] Working undercover, Landvoight helped Meyer \"play along,\" as the Petrillos plotted the murder that they wanted Meyer to carry out.\nThe plan was to steal or buy a car, take Alfonsi out to a dark country road and hit him with the car, thus making the murder look accidental.[3] Herman Petrillo preferred the idea to steal the car rather than buy one, but Landvoight and Phillips were hoping to convince Petrillo to give them money to buy a car for the murder, as it would give them the opportunity that Phillips had so long prayed for, to arrest him on counterfeit charges. In the end, Petrillo sold them some fake tender, ostensibly for buying a means of transportation to the planned crime scene.[4]\n",

He dropped out of high school and later acquired a job as a  truck driver and occasional chicken-plant worker.[1][2][3] He lived in a trailer with his wife and three daughters.[4]\nLane committed the murders while he made his way through the Northeastern United States during the summer of 2007. He had a DVD in his truck of the 2002 horror film Hunting Humans, about a serial killer who stalks his victims before killing them with a knife.[1] He also carried two large hunting knives, choke wire, and a leather mask with the eyes and mouth cut out.[5][1]\nHis first known victim was 42-year-old Darlene Ewalt, who lived in a suburban home in West Hanover Township, Dauphin County, near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.[4][6] She was stabbed and killed at around 2 AM on 13 July 2007.[7][8] At the time, she was talking on the telephone on her patio.[1] Lane slit her throat and stabbed her to death with a long knife[1] while her family was inside the house.[4]\nLane's second victim was a woman named Patricia Brooks, whom he stabbed on 17 July 2007 in Conewago Township, in rural York County, Pennsylvania, as she was sleeping on her couch.[1][8] She survived.[7][4]\nHis third victim was a 38-year-old woman in her duplex in Bloomsbury, New Jersey by the name of Monica Massaro.[1] He cut her throat and stabbed her in the head, neck, and chest, and killed her in her bedroom a day before he committed his final crime.[7][8]\nHis final crime transpired when he made a stop on I-495 in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, broke into a house on 30 July 2007, and while clad in all-black with a mask and gloves attacked 15-year-old Shea McDonough with a 15-inch hunting knife.[1][9][3]  Her parents, Jeannie and Kevin McDonough, awoke at 4 AM  to the sounds of her struggling.[9] Her 135-pound mother and 160-pound father were able to subdue the 245-pound Lane and wrestle the knife he was carrying away from him, though the mother suffered knife cuts.  Chelmsford Police were contacted, arrived at the scene where the father was holding him in a headlock, and arrested him.[5][7][3]\nWhile it has been speculated by law enforcement authorities that he has been involved with other murders in other parts of the country due to his extensive trucking routes, this has not been proven. He has refused to comment to police or the general public about this speculation.\nLane was linked to Ewalt by DNA on his knife. He was linked to Brooks similarly.[7][10] Police also discovered gloves with his DNA and one of his victim's blood.[11]\n",

Eyewitnesses said one of them launched an unprovoked attack on Barcoski, who received a laceration of the left cheek, five or six head wounds, two broken ribs and a fractured nose. Later at police barracks over the course of four hours, according to trial testimony, a third officer beat Barcoski with a strap while he lay semiconscious on the floor, twisted his ears until the miner cried aloud, and twisted his broken nose until he lapsed again into unconsciousness. Then he beat Barcoski over the chest with a poker until the poker bent, straightened the implement and beat the man again. He stripped the miner to the waist in order to better use a strap and kicked Barcoski until the miner's body rolled over and over on the floor. The original attacker also beat Barcoski, kicked him, struck him over the head with knucklers, and slapped him on the arms, legs and neck with his blackjack. The next morning he was taken to a hospital where he died. A jury acquitted the three officers of murder.[6]\nLater, two of the police responsible for his death were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and his widow was paid $13,500 by the Pittsburgh Coal Company as compensation.[7]\nIn the words of the Chicago Tribune, \"It was the fatal beating of John Barcoski, a miner in the Pittsburgh district several years ago, that hastened the end of \"the system.\"[8] Researchers acknowledged the historical role of John Barcoski's slaying in the demise of Coal and Iron Police.[9][10][11]\nPennsylvania state legislator and former miner Michael Musmanno was outraged by the case, and introduced a bill to banish this private police force.  The bill was vetoed by the Republican governor John Stuchell Fisher, which led to Musmanno's resignation.[12]  Musmanno then published a short story about the case, entitled \"Jan Volkanik,\" blending Barcoski's identity with a semi-legendary Polish coal mining figure. Fisher's successor, Gifford Pinchot, fatally crippled the private police forces by refusing to fund them or renew any of their state commissions, and the Coal and Iron Police officially ceased to exist in 1935.\nThat story in turn was basis for the 1935 film Black Fury starring Paul Muni and directed by Michael Curtiz.[13]  The film's subject matter was controversial.  The executive secretary of the National Coal Association, D.J. Battle, attempted to stop production through political pressure.  Its release was banned entirely in Chicago and several countries.[14]  The British Board of Film Censors deemed a speech describing the unfair relationship between the miners and union leaders as inflammatory, and ordered it removed.[15]\nIn 1966, Musmanno published a novel version of the screenplay also named Black Fury.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "On September 12, 2014, during a shift change at the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove Township, two state troopers were shot with a .308 caliber rifle. One trooper died at the scene and another was taken to a hospital where he recovered. Eric Frein was identified by the police as the only suspect in the case, and led the police on a weeks-long manhunt. He was eventually captured at an abandoned airport hangar on October 30, and charged with terrorism, murder, and attempted murder. Frein was convicted of all charges in April 2017, and subsequently sentenced to death.\nAt 10:50\u00a0p.m.[1] on September 12, 2014, a shift change was commencing outside the Troop R barracks of the Pennsylvania State Police in the Pocono Mountains in the Township of Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. At that moment, a sniper opened fire with a .308-caliber rifle.[2] One trooper was killed by the gunfire and a second was injured, but survived.[3][4][5]\nFour shots were fired within 90 seconds, from a distance of 82 yards (75\u00a0m) in a position at the edge of the nearby woods, before the shooter fled further into the wooded area.[6] One trooper was shot trying to help the other, prompting him to crawl back to safety, where he was aided by two other troopers.[7]\nEric Matthew Frein was identified as the main suspect of the attack after the discovery of an abandoned 2001 Jeep Cherokee three days after the event.[4][5][9] The vehicle was traced back to his parents, and multiple pieces of evidence, including bullet casings matched to the attack, were discovered inside.[2][10] He led authorities on a manhunt after the shootings, eventually being placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.[11][12]\nFrein was described by police as a \"self-taught survivalist\" with a grudge against law enforcement personnel.[13] At the time of the attack, he was a reenactor who acted in a variety of roles, most often Serbian soldiers.[4] In 2008, Frein founded Istocni Vuk or \"Eastern Wolf\", whose Myspace page pictured Frein engaged in recreational military simulations as a Serbian soldier.[14]\nThe police manhunt, initially involving nearly 200 officers by September 17,[10] grew to nearly 1,000 on September 24.[15] Law enforcement officers included local police; state police forces from Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey;[16] Federal Bureau of Investigation; U.S. Marshals Service; and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.[17] Frein was seen several times during the manhunt, but each time, officers were unable to approach him directly due to the rugged terrain of the area, which allowed Frein to escape. They subsequently believed Frein was taunting them during the manhunt.[15] A colleague from the MilSim group \"Red Alliance\" suggested that \"If he's re-enacting anyone, it's Rambo from the very first movie,\" referring to the character of John Rambo in First Blood.[18]\nFrein was captured by U.S. Marshals near Birchwood-Pocono Airpark, an abandoned airfield[19] approximately 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) ENE of Tannersville, on October 30, 48 days after the shooting.[20] At the time of his arrest, he was unarmed,[21] but a .308-caliber rifle and a pistol were recovered afterward. He was arrested without incident[22][23] and restrained using handcuffs belonging to Dickson.[24][25] The day after his capture, he was charged with first-degree murder and attempted murder in the attack.[26]\nAlthough Frein did not resist arrest, he suffered a cut to the bridge of his nose, as well as a scrape over his left eye and bruises to his cheeks and eyes.[27][28] The U.S. Marshals claim this occurred while he was lying on the ground during his arrest.[28][29] The Pennsylvania State Police, however, claim these injuries occurred while he was on the run.[30][31]\nAfter the attack, the Troop R barracks were immediately closed down for crime scene investigators to process it, and for repairs to windows shattered by gunfire. Trooper operations were temporarily handled at the barracks in Honesdale, about 20 miles (32\u00a0km) away. On November 12, 2014, two months after the attack, the barracks were reopened, with all but three employees (Alex Douglass and two others) returning to work.[6]\n",

After murdering Liu, Tung flew back to Taiwan with Chen and Wu, but was forced to flee to Manila a few weeks later during Operation Cleansweep a nationwide anti-gang raid.[2] He fled Manila after being questioned by authorities there during an investigation of the contract murders of two Chinese Filipino families, going to Thailand, and then Brazil, where he was apprehended and in April 1986 extradited to New York City.[3]\nTung first stood trial in New York State on Federal racketeering charges relating to a United Bamboo conspiracy to smuggle 660 pounds of heroin into the United States; however, he was acquitted of similar racketeering charges relating to Liu's murder due to his testimony that he shot Liu on orders from the Taiwan government, and not as part of a gang-related activity. As Brazil's extradition treaty with the United States specified that they would not extradite fugitives charged with crimes that could result in their execution, the prosecutor did not seek the death penalty. After the first trial, he was extradited from New York to California to stand trial for Liu's murder.[3] Like Chen, Tung stated that he had killed Liu for patriotic reasons. He was found guilty by a jury on 17 March 1988 after just 45 minutes of deliberations.[4]\nTung's sentence of 25 years to life for the murder and two years for the use of a firearm was passed on 12 May; the judge rejected a plea that his sentences be allowed to run concurrently, which could have seen him set free in just six years. According to prosecutors, he would not have been eligible for parole for 17 years and 8 months.[5] He was then sent to Pennsylvania to serve out his term for the drug charges. On 21 February 1991, he was attacked and stabbed by fellow prisoners at the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary in Lewisburg; after a long struggle to recover from his wounds, he died on 3 April.[1][2]\n",

        "paragraph": "United States v. Vampire Nation, 451 F.3d 189, is a 2006 decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit regarding the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and asset forfeiture. A three-judge panel unanimously affirmed the conviction and sentence of Frederick Banks, a Pittsburgh man, on numerous felony charges resulting from fraudulent schemes carried out over the Internet. The case takes its title, which has been singled out as memorable[1] and included among lists of amusingly titled cases,[2]  from one of Banks' aliases, an electronic music group of which he was the sole regular member.[3] He had filed the appeal under that name while representing himself.[4]\nBanks had been offering discounted versions of Microsoft software online under different names as an Amazon.com reseller. His products were either pirated or deficient, costing some customers thousands of dollars, and eventually one complained to the FBI, who arrested Banks after a short investigation. At trial a jury convicted him of mail fraud, criminal copyright infringement and several other charges.\nThe judge sentenced Banks to five years in prison, varying the sentence upward by three months from the maximum range specified by the sentencing guidelines. An in personam criminal forfeiture judgment was also entered against him. Banks appealed to the Third Circuit, citing those among seven possible grounds for reversing the conviction. Foremost among them, he argued that notice of the possibility of variance was required prior to the sentencing and that the district court lacked the statutory authority to order the criminal forfeiture.\nJudge Franklin Van Antwerpen wrote for the panel, which ruled for the government on all the issues. Other circuits had ruled on the variance issue, and he joined four of them in holding that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h), which required a court to notify lawyers in advance of a contemplated departure, did not impose the same requirement on a variance. The forfeiture was likewise permitted since the mail fraud statute provided for civil forfeiture and, while it explicitly provided for criminal forfeiture only in cases where a financial institution was victimized, he did not find that Congress intended to limit it only to those cases via \"a chain of cross-references.\"[5]\nUnder the names Rick Burgess and John Cain, Banks started offering Microsoft software for resale on Amazon.com in 2002. Amazon's policy, which Banks was made aware of when he opened the account, required that all such products offered for sale through the site by third parties such as himself be the full retail version, not copies or duplicates. Banks sold several copies of software over the next year. \"These buyers,\" Van Antwerpen recounted, \"suspected that the software they purchased from Banks was illegally copied because the compact discs (\"CDs\") they received from Banks contained generic white CDs with fake labels and fake package inserts.\"[6]\nSome complained to Amazon, and at the beginning of the following year Amazon terminated the \"Cain and Burgess\" account for violating its policies. Banks opened a new account under the name Mark Howard and resumed his activities. Court documents identified one buyer as Action Software, Inc., which bought $294,859.00 worth of Microsoft products through the site. Though the order should have filled approximately 50 boxes, only 5 boxes were shipped by Banks via UPS. Even more suspiciously, the CDs in the boxes bore the name of IBM. Action Software was not able to recoup the nearly $50,000 it had laid out since the order was cash on delivery.[6]\nWhen Banks denied any wrongdoing, Action Software contacted the FBI. In May 2003 the FBI obtained a search warrant and combed Banks' house, coming up with \"computers, blank CDs, a CD duplicating machine, and empty boxes from Microsoft and IBM software\". On the computers were \"images of the front and back sides of Microsoft software boxes\".[6]\nBanks continued offering software for sale on Amazon and later he approached VioSoftware, a Colorado reseller from whom he had purchased Microsoft software the year before. He persuaded Warren Do, the company's chief executive officer, to sell him nearly $60,000 worth of Microsoft products COD. Banks paid with a forged check. When Do found out, he asked for the software back and told Banks he had been talking to the FBI. The two agreed that Do would return the check if Banks returned the software. Do was subpoenaed by a grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania the next day, and told Banks via email that he had told the FBI all about their arrangement. In reply Banks pleaded with him not to tell the grand jury anything as \"this would all be for nothing.\"[6]\nInstead of returning what he had bought from VioSoftware, Banks shipped some of it to his other customers. What he did return later on was damaged. Do's contact with the FBI led to another search of Banks' house in September, yielding computers with evidence of software piracy and various Microsoft products and packaging.[6]\n",

On the morning of February 17, 1809, her employer found the baby's body in a rubbish bin behind his property. Susanna was immediately questioned, and while she admitted that the baby was hers, she insisted that it was stillborn. After a short investigation, she was convicted on April 7, 1809. Her the court-appointed lawyers did little to defend her and no witnesses were called to testify on her behalf. After a short imprisonment in the local sheriff's home, she was executed in Reading on June 10, 1809.[1]\nBerks County was home to large populations of German-language immigrants who settled there in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Cox shared this German heritage (referred to as Pennsylvania German or Pennsylvania Dutch). Cox was an uneducated woman who spoke a German dialect and could do little to defend herself in court. She had worked for the family of Jacob Geehr for eleven years, having been born into a poor family with few resources to educate or care for her. Little is known about her life before she came to work for the Geehrs, as she could not read or write and spent most of her time caring for the Geehrs' children.[1]\nWhile Susanna insisted through the investigation and trial that the baby had been stillborn, a medical examination of the body the day it was found saw the baby's jaw broken and fabric stuffed down its throat. Susanna would become the 8th woman in Pennsylvania since the state's founding to be executed for the crime of killing her illegitimate child.[1]\nAfter a brief trial, Cox was hanged in Reading, Pennsylvania, on June 10, 1809. Following her execution, her story gained such sympathy that it was written in a ballad and widely circulated in German and in English through newspapers and broadsides. This immensely popular ballad was printed in over 88 editions in its broadside form throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.[2] Today, the ballad is read at the annual summer Kutztown Folk Festival.[3]\nIn the 21st century, there have been several musical adaptions of the topic, including the following works:\n",

Upon his high school graduation, he attended college at both Penn State University and Columbia University. Playing the positions of halfback, fullback and quarterback, Robb was a standout in football at the college level. In 1916, he scored 36 points for the Nittany Lions against Gettysburg College, establishing the record for most points scored in a game by a Penn State player.[1]\nHe was elected captain of the Penn State football team in 1917, however he enlisted in the US Army instead, serving as a lieutenant during World War I. He was again elected to captain the 1918 Penn State team, however after receiving his commission as a lieutenant his college career moved him to Columbia University, where he played end. During the war, he was stationed with the 79th Infantry Division in France. However, he still played football for the 79th Division and was selected for the All-AEF team.  He rejoined Penn State in 1919.[2]\nRobb made his professional debut in 1921, in the American Professional Football League (which was renamed the National Football League in 1922) with the Canton Bulldogs, playing alongside football legend Jim Thorpe. At Canton, he helped the Bulldogs win back-to-back NFL Championships in 1922 and 1923. In 1924, the Pottsville Maroons of Pennsylvania's Anthracite League signed Robb for their season which resulted in the Maroons winning the Anthracite League Championship.[3] He then returned to Canton and coached the Bulldogs for two seasons beginning in 1925. He then returned to the field as a player, signing with the Pottsville Maroons, who were now members of the National Football League, playing alongside football greats Johnny \"Blood\" McNally and Pete Henry. Robb remained with Pottsville until the team relocated to Boston in 1929.\nRobb's whereabouts after 1928 are only speculative, but it is possible that he took up coaching outside of professional football. He was an official (umpire) in the 1947 NFL championship game between the Cardinals and Eagles. In 1962, he donated a wool Canton Bulldogs warm-up sideline jacket from the early 1920s to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[4] In 1963, Robb represented his former teammate, Wilbur Henry, as Henry was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nRobb died on December 15, 1971, at his home in Greenville, Pennsylvania, where he had moved recently from Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania. The cause of death was a shotgun wound to the chest, which was ruled a suicide.[5]\n",

The dispute occurred at the Homestead Steel Works in the Pittsburgh-area town of Homestead, Pennsylvania, between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (the AA) and the Carnegie Steel Company. The final result was a major defeat for the union strikers and a setback of decades for their efforts to unionize steelworkers. The battle was a pivotal event in U.S. labor history.\nCarnegie Steel made major technological innovations in the 1880s, especially the installation of the open-hearth system at Homestead in 1886. It now became possible to make steel suitable for structural beams and for armor plate for the United States Navy, which paid far higher prices for the premium product. In addition, the plant moved increasingly toward the continuous system of production. Carnegie installed vastly improved systems of material-handling, like overhead cranes, hoists, charging machines, and buggies. All of this greatly sped up the process of steelmaking, and allowed the production of vastly larger quantities of the product. As the mills expanded, the labor force grew rapidly, especially with unskilled workers. However, while Carnegie Steel grew and progressed, workers at Homestead were seeing their wages drop.[7][page\u00a0needed]\nThe Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) was an American labor union formed in 1876. It was a craft union representing skilled iron and steelworkers.\nThe AA's membership was concentrated in ironworks west of the Allegheny Mountains. The union negotiated national uniform wage scales on an annual basis; helped regulate working hours, workload levels and work speeds; and helped improve working conditions. It also acted as a hiring hall, helping employers find scarce puddlers and rollers.[8]\nThe AA organized the independently-owned Pittsburgh Bessemer Steel Works in Homestead in 1881. The AA engaged in a bitter strike at the Homestead works on January 1, 1882, in an effort to prevent management from including a non-union clause in the workers' contracts, known as a \"yellow-dog contract\". The violence occurred on both sides, and the plant brought in numerous strikebreakers. The strike ended on March 20 in a complete victory for the union.[9]\nThe AA struck the steel plant again on July 1, 1889, when negotiations for a new three-year collective bargaining agreement failed. The strikers seized the town and once again made common cause with various immigrant groups. Backed by 2,000 townspeople, the strikers drove off a trainload of strikebreakers on July 10. When the sheriff returned with 125 newly deputized agents two days later, the strikers rallied 5,000 townspeople to their cause. Although victorious, the union agreed to significant wage cuts that left tonnage rates less than half those at the nearby Jones and Laughlin works, where technological improvements had not yet been made.[10]\nCarnegie officials conceded that the AA essentially ran the Homestead plant after the 1889 strike. The union contract contained 58 pages of footnotes defining work rules at the plant and strictly limited management's ability to maximize output.[11]\nFor its part, the AA saw substantial gains after the 1889 strike. Membership doubled, and the local union treasury had a balance of $146,000. The Homestead union grew belligerent, and relationships between workers and managers became tense.[12]\n",

        "paragraph": "Laurie Show was a 16-year-old sophomore at Conestoga Valley High School who was stalked by her classmates and murdered on December 20, 1991, in the United States. Her body was discovered in her Lancaster, Pennsylvania, home by her mother Hazel Show with her throat having been slit.[2] Her classmates Lisa Michelle Lambert, Tabitha Buck, and Lawrence \"Butch\" Yunkin were all subsequently charged with her murder.\nLambert initially began harassing Show in 1991, after learning that Show had briefly dated Yunkin over the summer. Lambert and Yunkin had a previous relationship, but had reportedly not been dating during the time Yunkin was dating Show. Show and Yunkin had gone on a few dates, with Show reporting to her mother that Yunkin had date raped her.[3] Shortly after his final date with Show, Yunkin resumed dating Lambert, who was pregnant with his child. Reported to be \"obsessively jealous\" of Show, Lambert proceeded to harass Show in various ways, such as appearing at Show's job and verbally assaulting her.[4] Witnesses reported that Lambert had expressed an intent to \"scare Laurie, then hurt her, then slit her throat\".[5]\nOn December 20, 1991, Laurie Show was discovered, fatally wounded, in her home by her mother. Police later recorded that Show had received \"a five-inch gash to the throat; a stab wound that punctured a lung and another that grazed her spine; several wounds to the head; and a number of defensive wounds\". An autopsy showed that Show's left common carotid artery had been severed. [6] Hazel Show was not at home at the time of the attack, having been duped by the killers into going to the high school to speak to a guidance counselor.[7] Show's mother reported to the police that her daughter had named Lambert as her killer, saying, \"Michelle did it\". Shortly after, Show bled to death. [8]\nPolice arrested Lambert, Yunkin, and Lambert's friend, Tabitha Buck, at a local bowling alley later that day for the murder of Show. While in police custody, the detectives and police take notes and photographs of all three suspects. The police and detectives notice that Lisa Michelle Lambert has not one defensive wound on her, while Tabitha Buck had many, including fresh scratch marks on her face and scratch marks in her right shoulder. Lawrence Yunkin also had a few defensive wounds. For such a violent crime against Laurie Show, all three suspects should've had defensive wounds but Lisa Lambert had none. [9] Initial statements from the three claimed that Yunkin had dropped Lambert and Buck off at Show's house, where the two girls murdered Show. Yunkin stated that he had not participated in the murder, and that, while he was aware that Lambert and Buck planned to cut Show's hair with the knife as a prank, he did provide them with an alibi, as well as helping to dispose of evidence.[10] Lambert and Buck would later recant their initial statements, with Lambert claiming that an abusive Yunkin had encouraged her to harass and assault Show.[6]\nA few weeks after the crime, an earring back was found in the room of Laurie Show , which was found to belong to Lawrence Yunkin. This evidence was turned over the police and was eventually somehow lost in evidence.\nLambert, Buck, and Yunkin were each tried for the murder of Laurie Show. Yunkin agreed to testify against Lambert, stating that she and Buck had slit Show's throat after the two had punctured one of Show's lungs.[11] A pair of sweatpants Lambert had worn during the crime were entered into evidence by the prosecution, as Show's blood was present on them.[12] Another exhibit was a letter from Lambert to Yunkin, in which Lambert states, \"I know I'm not an angel, but Lawrence, I never got mad enough to kill.\"[11]\nLambert was convicted on July 20, 1992 of first-degree murder and criminal conspiracy in the death of Show.[13] Buck was convicted of similar charges, and both young women were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[14]\nLambert was initially incarcerated at Cambridge Springs State Correctional Institution, while Buck was sent to Muncy State Correctional Institution.[15] Yunkin received a lesser sentence for his testimony and was granted parole in 2003.[16]\nLambert appealed the 1992 conviction, and in 1997, appeared in court for a federal habeas corpus hearing.[12] U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell presided over the trial. Lambert's lawyers claimed there were several inconsistencies with the evidence and testimony given in the earlier trial, and that Lambert was innocent. Lambert claimed she had been framed by Lancaster police officers in order to keep her from coming forward with charges that they had gang-raped her.[17]\nA huge amount of Evidence provided at the hearing included the sweatpants entered into the 1992 proceeding as well as correspondence between Yunkin and Lambert where Yunkin admits in his own handwriting that he and Tabitha Buck killed Laurie Show and asked Lambert to take blame for him, because she'll get less time because she is a female. While understand the police and prosecutors consistently contradicted themselves and their story. While on the stand a police officer stated that he never found a pink trash bag which would prove with evidence of Lawrence Yunkin proving he was involved in the crime. A video tape was shown of this officer on the stand finding the pink trash bag with the evidence. Another key point in that the murder victim's mother Hazel show told the judge that she had in fact seen Lawrence yunkin at the crime scene on the morning of the murder and had in fact told police this and the police told Miss hazel show not to worry about it.  Dalzell overturned the murder conviction on April 15, 1997, citing that \"prosecutorial misconduct\" had resulted in an incorrect ruling.[6] Dalzell also barred the state of Pennsylvania from re-trying Lambert.[12] Dalzell's ruling was later overturned in January 1998 by a federal appeals panel that stated that Lambert had \"not yet exhausted her appeals in state court\" and Lambert was taken back to prison.[18]\n",

        "paragraph": "\n\nThe Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 (also known as the Philadelphia Mutiny) was an anti-government protest by nearly 400 soldiers of the Continental Army in June 1783. The mutiny, and the refusal of the Executive Council of Pennsylvania to stop it, ultimately resulted in Congress of the Confederation vacating Philadelphia and the creation of a federal district to serve as the national capital.\nFrom March 1781, the Congress and the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were situated at the Pennsylvania State House (now known as Independence Hall) in Philadelphia. Under the authority of the Articles of Confederation, Congress did not have direct control over the military, except in times of war, and was largely reliant on the use of state militias to enforce laws and keep order.[1]\nOn June 17, 1783, Congress received a message from soldiers of the Continental Army stationed in Philadelphia, which demanded payment for their service during the American Revolutionary War. The soldiers threatened to take action that day if their complaints were not addressed. Congress ignored their message, but the soldiers did not act on their threat. Two days later, however, the Congress received word that a group of about 80 soldiers had left their post at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, approximately 60 miles (97\u00a0km) west of Philadelphia, and had joined with the soldiers stationed at the city barracks. The group of approximately 500 men had effective control over the weapons stores and munition depot.[2]\nThe next morning on Friday, June 20, the State House was mobbed by as many as 400 soldiers demanding payment. The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Alexander Hamilton, a delegate from New York, persuaded the soldiers to allow Congress to meet later to address their concerns. The soldiers allowed the members of Congress to peacefully adjourn that afternoon.[3] That evening, a small Congressional committee headed by Hamilton met in secret to draft a message to the Pennsylvania Council, asking them to protect Congress from the mutineers. The letter threatened that Congress would be forced to move elsewhere if the Council did not act.[2]\nOn June 21, the Congressional committee met again at the State House with members of the Pennsylvania Executive Council, including its president, John Dickinson. The members of Congress asked the council to do more to protect the federal government. Dickinson and the council agreed to consult with the militia commanders and reply to Congress the next day. The following morning, the Pennsylvania Council again refused Congress' request. Lacking sufficient assurances that the state would be willing to protect Congress, the members left Philadelphia that day for Nassau Hall in Princeton, New Jersey, which became the provisional capital of the United States.[2][3]\nGeorge Washington, on hearing of the mutiny on June 24, sent 1,500 troops under the command of Major General William Heath and General Robert Howe, who came out of retirement, to suppress the mutiny. [4]\nSome of the mutineers ended up in a state of arrest, and Congress called an investigation into the event.\nThere are three reasons put forth as to why Dickinson and the Pennsylvania Council did not act. The council's official reasoning was that they were unsure that the local militiamen would actually protect Congress from their fellow soldiers. Further, the council may have thought that the conflict was not as serious as Congress believed and that the mutiny could be resolved peacefully.[2][3] The second theory put forth is that Dickinson, having been an officer in the militia, was sympathetic to the soldiers' grievances. The third theory is that the council refused to allow Pennsylvania, a sovereign state, to be subjugated by the demands of a few members of Congress.[2]\n",

Hose befriended Kach, often taking her out of classes to talk to her, and one day when he caught her skipping class, he kissed her. Over time, Hose convinced Kach to run away from her family and move in with him, which she did in February 1996. She was 14 years old at the time.[4]\nFor the first four years, she was not allowed out of the house. Hose lived with his parents and son,[2] and went to great lengths to keep Kach hidden from them. She was confined entirely to his second-story bedroom, and had to go to the toilet in a bucket. In 2000, Hose created a new identity for Kach, \"Nikki Allen\", and introduced her to his parents as his girlfriend who would be moving in with them. After this, she was occasionally allowed to leave the house but had a strict curfew. Six years later, she escaped.[5][6]\nAfter being allowed some time outside of the house, Kach began to realize that her relationship with Hose was not normal. She escaped from captivity on March 21, 2006, with the help of Joe Sparico, a grocery store owner in her neighborhood whom she had befriended, by revealing her true identity to him and asking him to send police to the house.[7] In 2007, Hose pled guilty to three counts of involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, statutory sexual assault, interfering with the custody of a child, corruption of a minor and child endangerment.[8] Hose was sentenced to a maximum of 15 years in prison[9] and was released in 2022, subsequently registering as a sex offender.[10]\nKach was happy to be reunited with her family, but has since become estranged from her father.[11] Through her marriage in September 2018,[12] she has a stepdaughter and stepson and is grandmother to her stepson\u2019s young children.\nSince her escape, Kach attempted to sue numerous government organizations for their failing of her, including the police and school board. All were dismissed.[1] She has also written a New York Times bestselling book titled Memoir of a Milk Carton Kid: The Tanya Nicole Kach Story.[13]\n",

He coached individuals and teams at the college level and also privately.\nDave and his brother, wrestler Mark Schultz, both won gold at the same Olympics (1984). The Schultzes were one of three sets of brothers (the others are Buvaisar and Adam Saitiev, and Anatoli and Sergei Beloglazov) to win both World and Olympic championships. The Schultz brothers won more NCAA, U.S. Open, World, and Olympic titles than any other American brother combination in history.\nSchultz was employed as a coach by John du Pont, a multimillionaire philanthropist who sponsored the private Foxcatcher wrestling team at an amateur sports center known as Foxcatcher Farm that he set up on his estate in Pennsylvania. In January 1996, du Pont murdered Schultz.\nDavid Lesley Schultz was born in Palo Alto, California, to Dorothy Jean St. Germain (n\u00e9e Rich)[1] and Phillip Gary Schultz. He was the brother of Mark Schultz, and two half-siblings \u2013 Michael and Seana. Schultz was of half Ukrainian-Jewish and half British descent.[2] His paternal grandparents were Estelle (Bernstein), a prominent paper company executive, and Maxwell L. Schultz, a business consultant.[2] He said in a video that he was a Christian by faith.[3][4]\nAs a young child, Dave was overweight (nicknamed \"Pudge\"), and was often bullied at school by classmates for his weight and appearance.[2] He also had dyslexia, which many of his teachers mistook for mental disabilities.[2]\nSchultz began wrestling in junior high school at David Starr Jordan Middle School in Palo Alto coached by Robert Hoskins.[5] In 1977 as a senior at Palo Alto High School, he became state champion. That year he also won both his first national and international wrestling titles. As a high school senior he pinned 2-time NCAA champion and NCAA \"Outstanding Wrestler\" Chuck Yagla at the Great Plains Championships. His brother Mark started competing in sports in gymnastics, winning the Northern California All-Around Gymnastics Championships in his age group. In his junior year he switched to wrestling, and in his senior year won state.[2]\nSchultz's high school wrestling records included winning first place in the prestigious Great Plains freestyle tournament, which qualified him to compete on his first U.S. international team in the Tbilisi Tournament in then-Soviet Georgia.[2] The Tbilisi Tournament is considered by many experts in the wrestling community to be the \"toughest tournament in the world.\"[2] Schultz earned a silver medal and was the highest-placing American at the tournament. Due to the timing of Tbilisi, Schultz was not able to compete in the high school tournaments that were required to qualify for the California State Championships, but his coach Ed Hart successfully petitioned the state coaches association to allow him to compete.[2] Wrestling two weight classes above his normal division, Schultz pinned all his opponents in the state championships but the last, whom he defeated 12\u20131 in the final match.[2] Later that year he won his first national title by winning the U.S. National Open Greco-Roman Championships and won the award for most falls in the least amount of time. Schultz's senior year is considered by most experts as the most successful senior year in U.S. high school wrestling history.[2]\nIn college, Schultz was a three-time NCAA All-American, first at Oklahoma State University and then twice at the University of Oklahoma. In 1982, he was the 167-pound weight class NCAA Champion defeating Mike Sheets from Oklahoma State University in the finals by criteria tie-breaker in overtime. His career collegiate record was 91\u20138: 30\u20134 at Oklahoma State University, 61\u20134 at the University of Oklahoma.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe 1985 MOVE bombing was the destruction of residential homes in the Cobbs Creek neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, by the Philadelphia Police Department during a standoff and shootout with the anarcho-primitivist commune MOVE. Police dropped two explosive devices from a police helicopter onto the roof of a house occupied by MOVE. The Philadelphia Fire Department allowed the resulting fire to burn out of control, destroying 61 previously evacuated neighboring homes over two city blocks and leaving 250 people unhoused.[1] Six adults and five children were killed in the attack,[2] with one adult and one child surviving. A lawsuit in federal court found that the city used excessive force and violated constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure.[3]\nIn 1981, MOVE relocated to a row house at 6221 Osage Avenue in the Cobbs Creek area of West Philadelphia. Neighbors complained to the city for years about trash around their building, confrontations with neighbors, and bullhorn announcements of political messages by MOVE members.[4][5] The bullhorn was broken and inoperable for the three weeks prior to the police bombing of the row house.[5]\nThe police obtained arrest warrants in 1985 charging four MOVE occupants with crimes including parole violations, contempt of court, illegal possession of firearms, and making terroristic threats.[6] Mayor Wilson Goode and police commissioner Gregore J. Sambor classified MOVE as a terrorist organization.[7] Police evacuated residents of the area from the neighborhood prior to their action. Residents were told that they would be able to return to their homes after a 24-hour period.[8]\nOn Monday, May 13, 1985, nearly 500 police officers, along with city manager Leo Brooks, arrived in force and attempted to clear the building and execute the arrest warrants.[8][7] Water and electricity were shut off in order to force MOVE members out of the house. At 5:35 a.m., commissioner Sambor read a long speech addressed to MOVE members that started with, \"Attention MOVE: This is America. You have to abide by the laws of the United States.\" They were given 15 minutes to come out. When the MOVE members did not respond, the police decided to forcibly remove the people who remained in house,[8][4] which consisted of seven adults and six children.[9]\nThere was an armed standoff with police,[10] who threw tear gas canisters at the building. The MOVE members fired at them, and a gunfight with semi-automatic and automatic firearms ensued for 90 minutes.[11] One officer was hit in the back in his flak jacket but was not seriously hurt.[4] Police used more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. At 2 p.m., commissioner Sambor ordered that the compound be bombed.[11]\nFrom a Pennsylvania State Police helicopter, Philadelphia Police Department Lt. Frank Powell proceeded to drop two 1.5-pound (0.75\u00a0kg) bombs (which the police referred to as \"entry devices\"[7]) made of  Tovex, a dynamite substitute, combined with two pounds of FBI-supplied C-4,[12] targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house.[4] The bombs exploded after 45 seconds, igniting the fuel of a gasoline-powered generator and setting the house on fire, which was left to burn. Officials later stated that this was to let the fire burn through the roof and destroy the \"bunker\", so police could then drop tear gas into the house and flush out the occupants. 30 minutes later, firefighters moved in to control the fire but there was gunfire and the firefighters and police were ordered back as the fire spread to neighbouring houses down the street. The only two MOVE survivors, Birdie Africa, who was 13 at the time, and Ramona Africa, both escaped the house. Police initially said that two men had also run out of the house at the same time and fired at them and that police had returned fire.[4] Ramona Africa said that police fired at those trying to escape. Police said that MOVE members moved in and out of the house shooting at the police.[13] The fire department later declared the fire under control at 11:47 p.m.[4]\nThe fire killed 11 of the people in the house, six adults and five children: John Africa, Rhonda Africa, Theresa Africa, Frank Africa, Conrad Africa, Tree Africa, Delisha Africa, Netta Africa, Little Phil Africa, Tomaso Africa, and Raymond Africa. 61 neighboring homes were destroyed by the fire, leaving 250 people unhoused.[14]\nMayor Goode appointed an investigative commission called the Philadelphia Special Investigation Commission (PSIC, aka MOVE Commission), chaired by William H. Brown, III. Commissioner Sambor resigned in November 1985; in a speech the following year, he said that he was made a \"surrogate\" by Goode.[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Reading Railroad Massacre occurred on July 23, 1877, when strikes in Reading, Pennsylvania, led to an outbreak of violence, during which 10 to 16 people were killed and between 20 and 203 were injured. It was the climax of local events during the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 towards the end of the Long Depression of 1873\u20131879, following arson and riots against local facilities of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway.\nUnits of the Pennsylvania State Militia were brought in by train. Near nightfall, one unit was marched into the Seventh Street Cut, a man-made ravine three blocks long with 20-or-30-foot (6.1 or 9.1\u00a0m) walls, to free a train that had been stopped by rioters. The soldiers were bombarded from above with bricks, stones, and gunshots, and some of the soldiers fired rifle volleys into a crowd at the far end of the Cut. Between 10 and 16 civilian deaths resulted, along with dozens of injuries. Most rioting ended that night, and tense quiet prevailed the next day. Ultimately, the arrival of federal troops restored order to Reading. A coroner's inquest following the massacre did not blame the militia for the deaths, but pointed to the overall upheaval in the city at the time. Blame was laid upon the local sheriff for failing to keep the public order.\nThe Long Depression, sparked in the United States by the Panic of 1873, had extensive implications for US industry, closing more than a hundred railroads in the first year and cutting construction of new rail lines from 7,500 miles (12,100\u00a0km) of track in 1872 to 1,600 miles (2,600\u00a0km) in 1875.[14] Approximately 18,000 businesses failed between 1873 and 1875, production in iron and steel dropped as much as 45 percent, and a million or more lost their jobs.[15][16] In 1876, 76 railroad companies went bankrupt or entered receivership in the US alone, and the economic impacts rippled through many economic sectors throughout the industrialized world.[17]:\u200a31\u200a\nIn mid-1877, tensions erupted in stoppages and civil unrest across the nation in what became known as the Great Railroad Strike or the Great Strikes. Violence broke out in Martinsburg, West Virginia, and spread along the rail lines through Baltimore and on to several major cities and transportation hubs of the time, including Reading, Scranton, and Shamokin, Pennsylvania; a bloodless general strike in St. Louis, Missouri; and a short lived uprising in Chicago, Illinois. In the worst case, rioting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, left 61 dead and 124 injured. Much of the city's center was burned, including more than a thousand rail cars destroyed. What began as the peaceful actions of organized labor attracted the masses of discontented and unemployed workers spawned by the depression, along with others who took opportunistic advantage of the chaos. In total, an estimated 100,000 workers participated nationwide.[18]\nIn 1877, the city of Reading was largely controlled by the  Philadelphia and Reading Railway under Franklin B. Gowen. The town was heavily reliant on rail along with the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company. There was a general doubt as to whether conditions existed for serious labor troubles. At one point, the Pottsville Miners Journal wrote in an editorial that \"the men have no organization, and there is too much race jealousy existing among them to permit them to form [a strike]\".[3]\nReading had seen strikes for a time. In early 1877, members of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen had requested a raise. When the railroad refused, and \"the men had no choice but to strike\", the railroad effectively crushed the trade union. They issued a letter telling their employees that, of those who were members of the Brotherhood, \"It has been deemed unadvisable to retain in the employment of this Company any one who is a member of that organization,\" issuing an ultimatum that they would either leave the union or lose their jobs. Many citizens of Reading were subsequently fired and blacklisted. Others who were still employed by the company were owed back wages, and had not been paid since the end of strikes in May, but they were eventually paid on July 20.[3][19][b]\nThroughout much of the early strikes elsewhere, there was little unrest in the town. Upon the start of strikes nationwide on July 16, the town remained relatively calm, to the point that the mayor left on a vacation to Ocean Grove, New Jersey.[20][3]\nViolence broke out on July 22, 1877, when a car filled with roof shingles was set ablaze on a railroad siding, near the corner of Elm Street and 7th Street.[c] A crowd of over two thousand people took the depot, and burned \"two cabooses, seven freight cars, and the watch house at the Reading and Lehigh Railroad junction at Bushong\u2019s Furnace\".[3][d] As a result of the ongoing unrest throughout Pennsylvania, the state militia was assembling to travel to the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg, under order of the governor. In order to prevent the militia from reaching the capitol, a group of rioters set fire to the Lebanon Valley Branch bridge over the Schuylkill River. The bridge was completely destroyed, with only the brick piers remaining. Rail travel with Harrisburg was blocked, the telegraph lines were damaged, and the debris halted passage both up and down the Schuylkill.[21] The damage was estimated at $150,000 (equivalent to $3,817,000 in 2021).[22][e]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Blue Eyed Six were a group of six men, all of them coincidentally blue-eyed, who were arrested and indicted on first degree murder charges in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania, in 1879.[1]\nThe Six were Charles Drews, Frank Stichler, Henry F. Wise, Josiah Hummel, Israel Brandt, and George Zechman. This group of friends and unsavory business associates conspired to murder their neighbor, Joseph Raber, for an insurance pay-off. Raber, age 65, lived in poverty with his housekeeper in a charcoal burner's hut in the Blue Mountain area of northern Lebanon County. Raber had no steady employment and depended mainly on the charity of his equally impoverished neighbors.\nIn early July 1878, four of the conspirators met at Brandt's hotel at St. Joseph Spring and agreed to insure Raber for a total of $8,000. The men told the insurance agent that they had agreed to take care of Raber for the rest of his life and wanted the policy to cover his eventual burial expenses. Several assessment-type life insurance policies were sold on Joseph Raber, with his cooperation, with the men named as the beneficiaries.\nLater that year they enlisted two other men to drown Raber in Indiantown Creek. Without any evidence to the contrary, the coroner ruled the death accidental. Although the local citizenry suspected foul play, it wasn't until two months later, when Drews' son-in-law Joseph Peters reported to the constable that he was an eye-witness to the murder, that the six men were arrested and held over for trial.\nIn a highly unusual move, the Six were tried together. Due to this and, perhaps, to the fanciful nickname that the conspirators were given by the newspapers, the trial gained more than its share of attention. Reporters from throughout the east coast descended on the city of Lebanon, the county seat of Lebanon County, and the story was carried worldwide. The trial began on 18 April. The Commonwealth's main witness was Drews' son-in-law, but he was only one of thirty-six witnesses called by the prosecution.\nThe defense called twenty-two witnesses. The witnesses on both sides were mainly friends, neighbors, and family members who contradicted each other at every turn. It became evident that there were many people who knew of, or suspected, the plot before and after Raber's death, but who did not come forward for fear of mortal retaliation. At 3:30\u00a0p.m. on 24 April 1879, the fate of the Blue Eyed Six was left in the hands of the twelve men of the jury.\nThe wait was not long. Five hours later the courthouse bell rang out, announcing that they had reached their verdicts. The jury returned verdicts of guilty of first degree murder for all six of the defendants. Defense requested that the jury be polled, and so the word \"Guilty\" was uttered seventy-two times, once for each defendant from each juror.\nThe local newspaper noted that it was the first time in the recorded history of common law of the United States and England that six people were convicted of murder on a single indictment. On appeal, the judge awarded Zechman a new trial, based on the lack of direct evidence presented by the Commonwealth against him personally. He was acquitted in his second trial on essentially the same evidence. The other five defendants were sentenced to death by hanging.\nDrews and Stichler, who had committed the crime, were hanged first. After all other appeals were exhausted, the accomplices Wise, Hummel, and Brandt were hanged the following year. The acquitted Zechman died of natural causes within the decade. Apart from the actual murder trial, the whole proceeding turned out to be an indictment of the murky business of assessment life insurance, which led to major changes in insurance law, particularly with regard to the practice of insuring people in whom one had no legal interest.\n",

Fonder had also been the prime suspect in the possible homicide of her father, Edward Fonder III, who disappeared in 1993.\nMary Jane Fonder was born on July 5, 1942, to Alice and Edward Fonder III of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[1] Fonder and her brother, Edward Fonder IV, grew up in West Philadelphia, where their father was a machinist and their mother was a proofreader.[1] Fonder experienced emotional problems during her childhood.[1] When Fonder was eight years old, her family purchased a second home in Springfield Township, a small rural town in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.[1] She attended John Bartram High School in Philadelphia, but had difficulty with her schoolwork due to emotional issues.[1] She was institutionalized for one month during her childhood after attempting to commit suicide by overdosing on chloral hydrate.[1] Shortly afterward, Fonder dropped out of high school and found social interactions increasingly difficult.[1]\nFonder worked various jobs during her early adulthood, including at a ceramics studio, a department store, various knitting factories, and the J.P. Lippincott publishing company, where she was a punchcard operator.[1] Fonder did not start dating until her late thirties and never formed any serious romantic relationships.[1] In 1987, at age 45, Fonder moved back to Springfield Township to care for her aging parents.[1] In 1992, her mother had a leg amputated due to circulation problems. However, she experienced surgical complications and died after spending four months in a coma.[1]\nEdward Fonder III became depressed after his wife's death and began fighting with his daughter more often.[1] Mary Jane Fonder later claimed their relationship became damaged beyond repair after two of Edward's elderly cousins visited from the Philadelphia area and harshly criticized how Mary Jane ate chicken.[1]\nOn August 26, 1993, the 80-year-old Edward Fonder III disappeared from the Springfield Township residence he shared with his daughter. Mary Jane Fonder claimed she had heard the front door open while lying in bed that morning and believed her father was stepping outside to get the newspaper.[1] Fonder claimed she went back to sleep and, after waking up at around 11:00 a.m., found that her father had disappeared. Fonder contacted the police and unsuccessfully searched for her father with the assistance of neighbors. Township police were suspicious of Fonder's claims that her father had wandered off, partially because the elderly man had trouble moving by himself and had no money or access to his medication.[1]\nMary Jane Fonder became the prime suspect in the possible homicide of her father.[1] The investigation was led by Springfield Township police officer Kimberly Triol. During one interview in Fonder's home, Triol discovered a bucket filled with pinkish water along with towels, a mop, and a chicken. She also found the corpse of a dog wrapped in plastic inside Fonder's freezer; it had been given a lethal dose of diabetes medication.[3] Fonder also displayed a Taser gun in a non-threatening manner to Triol during one of their interviews.[1]\nFonder initially cooperated with police in their investigation, but ceased contact with them after she perceived Triol had attempted to elicit a confession from her.[1] In February 1994, about six months after her father's disappearance, Fonder voiced her displeasure with police tactics, claiming they had forced her to hire a lawyer and to ban police from her property.[4]\nOn January 23, 2008, 42-year-old Rhonda Smith was shot as she did volunteer work in the office of the Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church in Springfield Township.[5] Smith, shot twice in the head, died at a hospital after being disconnected from life support.[1]\nFonder, then 65 years old, became a suspect early on in the investigation after the church's pastor told police about Fonder's history of inappropriate behavior,[4] which included leaving rambling voicemail messages for him and surreptitiously placing food in his kitchen without his knowledge or consent.[6][7]\n",

Despite being shot multiple times in the left arm, Hartnett was able to exit his car and shoot the fleeing suspect, Edward Archer. Later in the hospital, Archer claimed he pledged allegiance to ISIS. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated the shooting as a terrorist attack.\nThe case is widely cited in scholarly work on lone wolf terrorism, as in example of an individual who carries out an act of terrorism without having had actual contact with terrorist groups or individuals.\nArcher was convicted of the attempted murder of Officer Hartnett in January 2018.  He was sentenced to between 48.5 and 97 years behind bars.[3][4]\nUniformed police officer Jesse Hartnett was driving his marked Chevrolet Impala patrol car at about 11:40\u00a0p.m. at 60th Street and Spruce Street in West Philadelphia, when Archer, who had had no previous contact with the police on that particular evening, suddenly rushed toward the patrol car and fired 13 shots at Harnett, shoving his gun through the window to fire at point blank range.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11] The attacker, who was wearing a white thawb (a robe generally worn by Muslim men), reportedly waved down the police car, then began firing as the car slowed down.[6][12] He first fired through the driver's side window, then ran up to the car, reached through the shattered window, and continued firing directly at Hartnett,[11][13] who shielded his head with his left arm.[14]  Altogether, Archer fired 13 bullets at Harnett at close range; 3 of the bullets hit the officer.[15]\nHartnett, badly wounded and bleeding from three gunshot wounds to his left arm, nevertheless managed to stop the car, get out, and give chase. He was able to fire off three gunshots,[16] shooting Archer in the buttocks before radioing for help.[6][13][17] Archer was arrested a block away by other responding officers.[11]\nThe 9mm Glock 17 that Archer used to shoot Officer Harnett was recovered at the scene; the pistol had been stolen from the home of a police officer in 2013.[18][19]\nAfter he was arrested, Archer told investigators, \"I follow Allah,\" and, \"I pledge allegiance to the Islamic State, and that's why I did what I did.\"[20][21][22][23][6][7]\nEdward Archer, aged 30, was unemployed and living with his mother at Yeadon, Pennsylvania, at the time of the shooting.[24][25] He was allegedly armed with a 9mm Glock 17 handgun capable of carrying 13 rounds, which was reported stolen from the home of a police officer in October 2013;[6][7][11][25][26] the gun was recovered shortly after the shooting in Archer's thawb.[16][27] Archer confessed that he committed the attack \"in the name of Islam\", that Allah ordered him to commit the attack, and that he targeted a police officer because they defended laws that went against the teachings of the Quran.[6][7][11][26][28]\nArcher was said to have become interested in Islam during his teenage years.[29] He was well known to Asim Abdur Rashid, imam of Masjid Mujahideen on south 60th Street in West Philadelphia, who knew him by his Muslim name, Abdul Shaheed.[30][31][24]  According to Imam Rashid, Archer had made the Haj to Mecca and had studied for perhaps six months in Egypt.[30]  He was described by local Muslims as devout, interested in the religion, and closely involved in the establishment of community activities.[32]\n",

        "paragraph": "Pennsylvania Hall, \"one of the most commodious and splendid buildings in the city,\"[2] was an abolitionist venue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, built in 1837\u201338. It was a \"Temple of Free Discussion\", where antislavery, women's rights, and other reform lecturers could be heard.[3] Four days after it opened it was destroyed by arson, the work of an anti-abolitionist mob. Except for the burning of the White House and the Capitol during the War of 1812, it was the worst case of arson in American history up to that date.\nThis was only six months after the murder of Rev. Elijah P. Lovejoy by a pro-slavery mob in Illinois, a free state. The abolitionist movement consequently became stronger. The process repeated itself with Pennsylvania Hall; the movement gained strength because of the outrage the burning caused. Abolitionists realized that in some places they would be met with violence. The country became more polarized.\nLocated at 109 N. Sixth Street, the site was \"symbolically and strategically ideal\". It was near where the United States was born, where the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were created. It was also in the middle of the Philadelphia Quaker community, so active in the beginnings of the abolition of slavery and in aiding fugitives.[4]:\u200a1\u200a\nThe inspiration for the building, to the extent there was one, was Temperance Hall, also in downtown Philadelphia, at 538\u201340 N. Third St. It seated 300\u2013600, and was the venue for various lectures and debates. Many organizations, including abolitionist groups, held meetings there in the 1830s, \"with [an anti-abolitionist] crowd at one time determined to burn the place down.\"[5]\nConsidering the organization that built it, the offices and stores located there, and the meetings held during the four days of its use, the new building was clearly intended to have an abolitionist focus. But to name it \"Abolition Hall\" would have been reckless and provocative. \"Pennsylvania Hall\" was a neutral alternative. \"The Board of Managers took pains to make clear that the hall was not exclusively for the use of abolitionists. It was to be open on an equal basis for rental by any groups 'for any purpose not of an immoral character'.\"[6]:\u200a128\u200a\nThe Hall was built by the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society \"because abolitionists had such a difficult time finding space for their meetings\".[2] The building was designed by architect Thomas Somerville Stewart; it was his first major building.\nTo finance construction a joint-stock company was created. Two thousand people bought $20 shares, raising over $40,000. Others donated material and labor.[2]\nOn the ground floor were four stores or offices, which fronted on Sixth St.[1]:\u200a3\u200a[6]:\u200a127\u200a One was an abolitionist reading room and bookstore; another held the office of the Pennsylvania Freeman, John Greenleaf Whittier's newly-reincarnated abolitionist newspaper.[7] Another held the office of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, the building's manager, and the fourth was devoted to the sale of products grown or produced without slave labor (free produce).[8]\nThe first floor also contained \"a neat lecture room\" seating between 200 and 300 persons, fronting on Haines Street. There were two committee rooms and three large entries and stairways 7 feet (2.1\u00a0m) wide leading to the second floor.[1]:\u200a3\u200a\n",

Racial tensions increased greatly during the World War I industrial boom due to white hostility toward the large influx of southern blacks who moved North as part of the Great Migration. The riot began after a black man walking in a white neighborhood with his girlfriend and another couple bumped into each other. This led to a fight in which the black man stabbed and killed the white man. In retaliation, white gangs targeted and attacked blacks throughout the city. Four days of violent melees involving mobs of hundreds of people followed. The Chester police along with the Pennsylvania National Guard, Pennsylvania State Police, mounted police officers and a 150-person posse finally quelled the riot after four days.  The riot resulted in 7 deaths, 28 gunshot wounds, 360 arrests and hundreds of hospitalizations.\nChester, a small town known for shipbuilding and textile manufacturing, had a community of approximately 4,400 blacks by 1900. The community included businesses and churches.  Chester's neighborhoods, largely white and black middle- and working-class, were generally segregated by race, income and social status.[1]\nThe increase in industrial manufacturing due to economic production related to World War I brought massive and disruptive growth to Chester.  The Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Co. opened in 1917 to build tanker ships,[2] the idled Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works shipyard was revived as the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation[3] and the Baldwin Locomotive Works in nearby Eddystone produced locomotives and railway gun carriages for the war.[4]  Between 1910 and 1920, Chester's population increased from 34,000 to 58,000 due to an influx of southern and eastern Europeans as well as southern U.S. blacks arriving to work in the shipyards and other industrial manufacturing.[5]\nThe hostility of Chester's white residents toward black residents grew as southern blacks migrated to Pennsylvania as part of the Great Migration.[6]  In 1910, Chester was home to approximately 6,000 blacks, 15% of the city's population.  At the height of the World War I industrial boom, the population of blacks in Chester increased to 20,000, 25% of the city's population.[7]  Black workers lived in filthy and overpopulated segregated work camps hastily erected near factories.  The white residents of Chester became frustrated with the rapid changes and congestion in Chester and placed the blame for these social ills on the influx of black workers.[8]  Many white workers viewed black workers as strikebreakers and resentment toward blacks in Chester mirrored race riots in East Saint Louis and Philadelphia.[9]  There were multiple cases of individual interracial violence in Chester leading up to July 1917.[10]\n",

As victims, he primarily chose prostitutes working in parking lots and truck stops located alongside Interstate 71. There are suspicions that he committed three similar killings in New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania, between 1986 and 1988. Dr No was identified as Samuel Legg III\nSome of the victims were prostitutes at the Union 76 truck stop in Austintown, east of Akron and west of Youngstown, which is the largest in Ohio, leading the investigators to suspect that the killer was a truck driver. Most victims were found without underwear and shoes. \nThe killings began in 1981, when the body of a young woman was found in Miami County, Ohio on April 24. After a forensic examination, it was determined that the victim died from strangulation, having received a head injury beforehand. At the time of her discovery, no personal belongings or documents were found, making her identification difficult. She was well-groomed, and there was no evidence of sexual assault; investigators did not characterize her as a prostitute. She was nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl\", from a tasseled buckskin poncho she was wearing. In 2018, the victim was finally identified as Marcia King.[2][3]\nThe next victim was 25-year-old Marcia Matthews, who was found, beaten but barely alive, on June 16, 1985 by a trucker one mile away from the Union 76 truck stop. She died two and a half days later from a traumatic brain injury, sustained after a beating with a blunt object.[4]\nOn July 20, 1986, the body of 23-year-old prostitute Shirley Dean Taylor was discovered, who was also beaten and strangled to death. Before her disappearance, she was seen at the Union 76 truck stop, where, according to witness reports, she went to meet a regular client nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whose identity was never established. Her body was discovered a few miles from the place of her disappearance, with her underwear and shoes missing. \nIn December 1986, 18-year-old prostitute April Barnett also went missing from the Union 76 truck stop, with her body found only a few days later 70 miles from Austintown. As with previous cases, the victim was beaten and strangled to death, with some of her clothes missing as well. \nA few days after, 28-year-old prostitute Jill Allen was found murdered in Illinois, near Interstate 70. Despite the fact that she had been found in another state, she was deemed a victim of the same killer due to the modus operandi. Allen had also been beaten and asphyxiated, with strangulation marks found on her neck. Her shoes, bra, and underwear were never found.[5]\nThe next victim was 27-year-old Anne-Marie Patterson, who went missing on February 7, 1987 from the Union 76 Austintown. Her semi-decomposed body was found 40 days later, 250 miles away from Austintown, near Cincinnati. A week before the disappearance, Patterson had been arrested by police. At the police station, she gave information about a murder suspect and described his car. During the investigation, law enforcement agencies discovered that Patterson had made an appointment via CB radio with the client, nicknamed \"Dr. No\", whom she characterized extremely negatively, and then disappeared. From this, the police and later the media used the nickname for the unidentified criminal.[6][7]\nOn August 10 1987, another victim's body was found in Englewood. The victim's jeans and underwear were at her ankles, while the upper parts of the clothes were missing. According to the nature of grass depressions and tire tracks located at the scene, forensic experts determined that the killer threw the victim's corpse out of his car. An autopsy revealed that the victim was a young woman, aged 20-25, and had died from strangulation. Despite the abundance of tattoos on her body, as well as jewelry the offender had not stolen, she remained unidentified until 2010. The victim was identified as Paula Beverly Davis, 21, after relatives recognized her tattoos pictured from her listing in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System.[8][9][10] Although she was included on the task force relating to the murders (formed in 1991), additional theories exist suggesting a drug dealer's retaliation, an unknown woman last seen in her company, or an unrelated serial killer.[11]\n",

On July 3, 1986 their mutilated and dismembered bodies were found burning at a baseball diamond in Middletown.[2][3]\nAfter getting into a light medium-sized van with two male clients on June 30, 1986, the men they had left with were never seen again. Other transgender sex workers describe the men last seen with the victims as being two white men between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five. The driver had curly dark hair and a mustache; the second suspect was blonde and clean shaven.[4] At 12:31\u00a0a.m. on July 3, 1986, police and firefighters responded to the report of a brush fire; the Fairless Hills Fire Co. found two burning bodies instead. Through meticulous fingerprint analysis, hands cut off of the charred victims were matched with prison records by the FBI, both being identified as Jonathan Streater and Faustino Arroyo.[5]\nTanya Moore was a thirty-one-year-old transgender sex worker. She was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Tanya had over twenty arrests for prostitution in Pennsylvania going back thirteen years prior to her death. Tiffany Hall, a friend of Tanya and Tina said, \"Streater was clean cut and went to church\". but that Tina was \"boy crazy\" and estranged from her family; always getting bailed out of jail for prostitution and other offenses.[6]\nTina Rodriguez was a twenty-seven-year-old transgender sex worker. She was born in Puerto Rico, but grew up in Camden, New Jersey. She had over fifty prostitution arrests in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York prior to her death. Her half-brother, Arnaldo Mojica, told a newspaper in 1986 that Arroyo hadn't been seen at the family's home in Camden for six months leading up to the murders. Mojica said the family knew Arroyo was \"gay\". Arnaldo also said that Arroyo's mother \"went all the time to Philadelphia to get him out of jail, going on to say, \"We tried to help him, tell him to stay home, but he would always go away.\" Tina was the smaller of the two; weighing one hundred and twenty pounds (54\u00a0kg) at five\u00a0foot six\u00a0inches (1.68\u00a0m) tall.[7]\nAround 2001, a witness told police Moore and Rodriguez were killed by himself and an \"infamous member of the Warlocks Motorcycle Club\" after picking them up for sex and discovering they were transgender. No charges were filed because the statement was made under a proffer agreement.[8]\n",

Daugherty, who was mentally disabled, was tortured and murdered before being wrapped in Christmas decorations, put inside a garbage can, and dumped in the parking lot of Greensburg-Salem Middle School.\nAmber Meidinger met Melvin Knight at a homeless shelter in Washington in January 2010. They moved to several locations before settling in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where they met Jennifer Daugherty.[1] Knight met Ricky Smyrnes after meeting previously in jail.[2]\nMelvin L. Knight (born October 27, 1989)[3] was born to a drug-addicted father who was imprisoned during the early years of his life. He developed lifelong learning and social problems after he fell out of a moving vehicle and hit his head at age 5.[4]\nAngela Lynn Marinucci (born July 14, 1992),[3] according to testimony by her mother and half-sister, Marinucci suffered a head injury when she was hit by a truck in 2008, at the age of 15. The injury substantially altered her behavior and pushed her into a downward spiral that ended with Daugherty\u2019s death, according to the defense. Two mental experts testified that Marinucci as a child, suffered from depression and that she may have had drug and alcohol addictions as a teenager.[5]\nMeidinger told jurors, \"at some point, she [Daugherty] trusted me because she knew me from the West Place (a center for people with special needs).\" Meidinger testified she and her then-boyfriend and co-defendant Melvin Knight met Smyrnes on February 8, 2010, after she and Knight had been staying at a Greensburg-area hotel. Knight and Smyrnes knew each other after meeting in jail, and Meidinger was pregnant with Knight's child when all three met up. Smyrnes offered Meidinger and Knight to stay at his apartment at 428 N. Pennsylvania Avenue in Greensburg.[6]\nRicky Ven Edward Smyrnes (born March 6, 1986)[3] was born to a drug-addicted Philadelphia sex worker and a Pittsburgh gang member. He was moved into and out of foster homes as a child and was treated for mental health disorders as early as age 4. He suffered abuse and neglect until he was taken in by the Smyrnes family in North Huntingdon at age 10, according to testimony by forensic psychologist Alice Applegate.[7] His lawyer, Terri Fayes, told the jury that Smyrnes suffered sexual and physical abuse from his father and his uncle. She also explained how he had tried beer, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana by age 6, had been diagnosed with PTSD at age 8, and had undergone 103 therapy sessions by age 10. She added he was diagnosed as having as many as seven different personalities, and 15 total psychiatric issues. In 1997, he burglarized his neighbor's home and stole knives, guitars, coins, bullets, and cash. That same year, he sexually assaulted a woman in her basement.[8]\nAccording to a testimony by Meidinger, the group went through her purse and stole money, gift cards, and her cell phone. They poured liquids into her bag, hit her head with filled soda bottles, cut her hair, painted her face with nail polish, and dumped liquid and spices on her head. Meidinger said she and Angela Marinucci took turns violently hitting Daugherty with a metal towel rack and crutches. She also noted that Daugherty was stripped naked, gagged, and raped by Knight.[1] They also forced her to consume feces, urine, and detergent.[9][10] Meidinger also said Knight took Daugherty to the living room where Marinucci poured a bottle of water over Daugherty's head and Knight and Smyrnes dumped oatmeal and spices on her head. Daugherty said that her eyes were burning, and Smyrnes told her to take a shower because she smelled bad.[2]\nAccording to her relatives, Daugherty had the mental abilities of an adolescent, trusted everyone, and thought that the suspects were her \"friends.\"[11]\n",

Haefner was never charged with her murder, and died in 2002.\nElizabeth Ruth \"Betsy\" Aardsma[5] was the second of four children.[6] She was born in Holland, Michigan, to Esther and Richard Aardsma, and raised in a middle-class, religious and conservative household on West 37th Street.[7] Aardsma's father was a sales tax auditor for the Michigan State Treasurer, while her mother was a housewife.[8]\nAs a child, Aardsma displayed a flair for art and poetry. By adolescence, she had developed somewhat liberal ideals and displayed a concern for the underprivileged. Aardsma attended Holland High School and performed well academically, graduating with honors in 1965.[2][n 1]\nShortly after graduating from high school, Aardsma enrolled in Hope College in the fall of 1965, with aspirations to become a physician.[9] Her roommate, Linda DenBesten, later recollected Aardsma as an intelligent and fascinating individual who exhibited feminist traits.[10]\nIn the fall of 1967, Aardsma enrolled at the University of Michigan, studying art and English and sharing an apartment with three other female students. By her senior year, she had begun dating a medical student named David Wright, who by all accounts was her first serious boyfriend.[n 2] She graduated from this institution with honors in the summer of 1969.[10]\nUpon graduation from the University of Michigan, Aardsma initially intended to join the Peace Corps and travel to Africa, although she opted to enroll at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) when she discovered that Wright, her boyfriend, intended to study there and that he could not guarantee he would remain loyal to her if she traveled abroad for any significant length of time.[12]\n",

Rose had an empty handgun magazine in his pocket and gunshot residue on his hand. Allegheny County Medical Examiner Daniel Wolfe said the residue was likely the result of Rose firing a gun.[2][3][4] He was transported to McKeesport Hospital where he was later declared deceased.[5]\nFollowing the shooting, Rosfeld was charged with criminal homicide.[6] After a 4-day trial, Rosfeld was acquitted on all counts.[7]\nOn October 25, 2019, Rosfeld and East Pittsburgh settled a civil lawsuit over Rose's death for $2 million.[8]\nRose was 17 years old when he died.[9] He had worked as a community volunteer and was a student at Woodland Hills High School, where he took Advanced Placement classes.[10][11] According to the family attorney, Rose had no significant criminal record prior to his death.[12] His mother had been a clerk for another police department.[12] His maternal grandfather had been a police officer for more than 35 years in a different jurisdiction.[13]\nRosfeld, the officer involved in this shooting, had been sworn in to the East Pittsburgh Police Department only a few hours before the shooting, and trained with the department for three weeks prior. He had seven years experience with other police departments, including those in the Pennsylvania towns of Oakmont and Harmar, and the University of Pittsburgh.[14] Rosfeld left the University of Pittsburgh \u201cafter discrepancies were found between one of his sworn statements and evidence in an arrest.\u201c [15]\nOn Tuesday June 19, 2018, there was a drive-by shooting in North Braddock around 8:30\u00a0p.m. 10 minutes later, police stopped a car matching witness descriptions of the silver Chevrolet Cruze used in the drive-by shooting. The police observed bullet holes on the side of the car.[16]\nA video recording taken by a bystander shows police ordering the driver to step out from the car.[16] While the driver was being handcuffed, Rose and the third occupant, Zaijuan Hester, ran from the car.[17] Rosfeld fired three rounds, and Rose was struck by all three.[17] He was pronounced dead at McKeesport Hospital.[5]\nIn the video, a woman's voice is heard saying, \"Why they shooting at him? All they did was run, and they shooting at them.\"[sic] [3] Police said that Rose had been unarmed when he was shot.[17] Hester escaped, but was later arrested.[18]\nHester was charged with the drive by shooting.[19] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published video footage showing Rose in the front passenger seat of a Chevrolet Cruze, while Hester fired through the rear window behind him. Contradicting that video evidence, drive-by victim William Ross told investigators on January 17, 2019 that Rose was in fact the individual who had shot him: \"The beef was between me and him, that car came by, he shot me, I ran to the store.\"[20]\n",

Gosnell was convicted of the murders of three infants who were born alive after using drugs to induce birth, was convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of one woman during an abortion procedure, and was convicted of several other medically related crimes.[3][4][5][6][7]\nGosnell, based in the Mantua neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned and operated the Women's Medical Society Clinic, a non-compliant abortion clinic that was dubbed a \"house of horrors\" during the trial.[8] He was a prolific prescriber of OxyContin.[9] In 2011, Gosnell, his wife Pearl, and eight employees were charged with a total of 32 felonies and 227 misdemeanors in connection with deaths, illegal medical services, and regulatory violations. Pearl and the eight employees pleaded guilty to various charges in 2011 while Gosnell pleaded not guilty and sought a jury trial.[10]\nIn May 2013, Gosnell was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of three of the infants and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, an adult patient at the clinic following an abortion procedure. Gosnell was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour informed consent law. After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.[11][12] Gosnell was sentenced to an additional 30 years in prison for federal drug charges.[13]\nGosnell was born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the only child of a gas station operator and a government clerk[14] in an African-American family.[15] He was a student at the city's Central High School from which he graduated in 1959.[16][17] Gosnell initially attended the University of Pennsylvania,[18] then graduated from Dickinson College with a bachelor's degree.[19] He received his medical degree at the Thomas Jefferson University in 1966.[16]\nIt has been reported that Gosnell spent four decades practicing medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and a teen aid program.[16] He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua.[14][20] Gosnell told The Philadelphia Inquirer in October 1972: \"As a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them.\"[21]\nThat same year, Gosnell also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental \"Super Coil\" method invented by Harvey Karman. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. However, complications from the procedure were reported by nine of the women, with three of these reporting severe complications.[22][23]\nThe 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a \"respected man\" in his community, and a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce's \"Young Philadelphian of the Year\" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House.[21] By the late 1980s, however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien.[21]\nGosnell has been married three times. His third and current wife, Pearl, had worked at the Women's Medical Society as a full-time medical assistant from 1982 until their marriage in 1990.[1]  They have two children.[24] Gosnell has four other children from his two previous marriages.[24] In covering his background, media commentators drew attention to the \"incredibly diverse\" portrayals of Gosnell, touching on both his community works \u2013 the creation of the halfway house and teen aid program \u2013 contrasted with portrayals of his practice as an abortion mill in which viable fetuses and babies were routinely killed following illegal late-term procedures.[16]\n",

His deformity was the genetic condition ectrodactyly, in which the fingers and toes are fused together to form claw-like extremities. Because of this, Stiles performed under the stage name \"Lobster Boy\".\nAccording to Grady's father, the Stiles family had a long history of ectrodactyly, dating back to 1840. Grady Stiles Jr. was the fourth child of Grady F. Stiles Sr. and his wife Edna. Capitalizing on his deformity, Grady Stiles Sr. was a sideshow attraction in a traveling carnival. After Grady Jr. was born he was folded into his father's sideshow act at the age of seven.[1] Stiles married twice and had four children, two of whom also had ectrodactyly. Stiles and his two children toured together as The Lobster Family. When not traveling with the carnival, the Stiles family lived in Gibsonton, Florida, where many other carnival performers lived during the winter season.\nStiles was an alcoholic and was abusive to his family.[1] Due to his ectrodactyly, he was unable to walk. While he sometimes used a wheelchair, he most commonly used his hands and arms for locomotion. He developed substantial upper body strength that, when combined with his bad temper and alcoholism, made him dangerous to others.\nIn 1978 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Stiles shot and killed his oldest daughter's fianc\u00e9 on the eve of their wedding. He was brought to trial, where he openly confessed to killing the man and was convicted of third-degree murder.[2][3] He was not sent to prison as no state institution was equipped to care for an inmate with ectrodactyly. Stiles was instead sentenced to house arrest and fifteen years probation.\nStiles stopped drinking thereafter, and during this period remarried his first wife, Mary Teresa. However, he soon began drinking again and his family claimed that he became even more abusive. In 1992, Teresa, together with her son from a previous marriage, Harry Glenn Newman Jr., hired a seventeen-year-old sideshow performer named Chris Wyant to kill Stiles for $1500 dollars .[4]\nWyant was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to 27 years in prison. Harry Newman was given life in prison for his role as the mastermind and Teresa was given 43 years in prison for conspiracy to commit murder.\nStiles' son, Grady Stiles III, disputes the claim that Teresa had him murdered. According to him, his mother, Teresa, and father were arguing. Teresa had said 'Something needs to be done.' Teresa's son overheard this, and went to a neighbor and repeated those words. Shortly after this happened, as Stiles smoked a cigarette while watching television on the sofa, the neighbor entered his home with a semi-automatic pistol and shot him in the head twice, killing him. Stiles was reportedly widely disliked in his community, so much so that only 10 people came to his funeral, and nobody volunteered as a pallbearer to carry his coffin.[5]\nFred Rosen wrote a book on the case called Lobster Boy: The Bizarre Life and Brutal Death of Grady Stiles Jr., and E! made a True Hollywood Story episode based on the case titled \"The Murder of Lobster Boy\". A&E Network also made a City Confidential episode based on the case called \"Gibsonton: The Last Side Show\".\nStiles' likeness appears on the album cover for Silverchair's Freak Show.\nA person like Grady, going by the name of \"Lobster Boy\", appears in a Deadpool comic. Deadpool was hired to assassinate him, but fails when he figures out he is possessed by Xaphan, a fallen angel, and starts possessing the souls. He was later saved by the two Ghost Riders, but at the end is shot again in the head by Deadpool for being cruel to other freaks.[6]\n",

In his early years, Page said that he had no awareness of racial differences. His family moved to Youngstown, Ohio when he was nine, and they lived in a neighborhood largely composed of families of European descent. He said that many of his childhood friends were Polish and Italian. Representatives from the Ohio State University football team pursued Page and his friend Joe Donchess, but Page did not finish high school and Donchess ended up as an All-American end at University of Pittsburgh.[1]\nIn 1923, Page signed with the Toledo Tigers, but he was cut before playing a game. Over the next several seasons, he played for numerous Negro league teams, including the Newark Stars, Brooklyn Royal Giants and Baltimore Black Sox.[2]\nPage played with the Homestead Grays in 1930 and 1931. Page is sometimes remembered for a fight that he had with Grays teammate George Scales. He knocked out two of Scales's teeth after Scales criticized his performance on the field. The fight was broken up, but Page slept with a gun in his hand that night and Scales kept a knife in his hand.[3] He moved on to the Pittsburgh Crawfords, where he batted in front of Cool Papa Bell.[4] Players on Gus Greenlee's Crawfords teams frequently worked for Greenlee in the offseason.[5] One winter after a Crawfords season, Page made $15 per week to act as a watchman at the numbers house of owner Gus Greenlee.[6] Teammate Judy Johnson once worked as Greenlee's chauffeur.[5]\nIn 1934, popular major league pitcher Dizzy Dean assembled a team of major league players and a team of Negro league players to tour large metropolitan areas and play exhibition games against each other. The Negro league team included Page, Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, Jud \"Boojum\" Wilson and Cool Papa Bell. The major league team included Paul Dean, Larry French and a retired Hack Wilson. Page said that his team won seven out of nine matchups.[7]\nAfter retiring from baseball, Page operated a bowling alley in Pittsburgh.[8] He was inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1977.[9] Page was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat on December 1, 1984. Jeffrey Sullivan, 20, was charged with his murder. Sullivan had performed yard work for Page and said that Page owed him money. Sullivan was convicted of second-degree murder and is serving a life sentence.[9]\nIn August 2013, the Negro Leagues Baseball Grave Marker Project announced that it would hold a ceremony to mark Page's grave at Allegheny Cemetery in Pennsylvania. Page's ashes were thought to have been lost, but they were located in a community cellar at the cemetery. During his later life, Page raised money to mark the grave of Negro league star Josh Gibson at the same cemetery.[9]\n",

        "paragraph": "Troy LaFerrara was a Port Trevorton, Pennsylvania man murdered on November 11, 2013. Miranda Barbour and her husband, Elytte Barbour, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in September 2014.[1] The murder is notable because of the unsubstantiated claim by one of the killers, Miranda Barbour, that she had murdered at least 22 other people, triggering worldwide news coverage of the case.[2]\nThe couple met Troy LaFerrara through an ad on Craigslist, where Miranda offered to have sex with him in exchange for payment.[3][4] Elytte has publicly denied that Miranda is a sex worker. He said that she met men that paid her for \"delightful conversation.\"[5] Miranda has stated that she agreed to meet LaFerrara for sex, charging $100.[6]\nOn November 11, 2013, Miranda allegedly met LaFerrara at the Susquehanna Valley Mall parking lot in Hummels Wharf, Pennsylvania. After settling on payment, Miranda and LaFerrara then drove six miles to Sunbury, a small city located about 100 miles northwest of Philadelphia.[7] Elytte Barbour told police that he hid under a blanket in the back seat waiting.[8] After she allowed LaFerrara into her vehicle, Miranda signaled to Elytte, who jumped out and wrapped a cord around LaFerrara's neck as Miranda stabbed him 20 times in their Honda CR-V.[9] LaFerrara's body was discovered the next day, November 12, 2013, in a residential back yard in Sunbury.\nPolice said after Miranda and Elytte dumped LaFerrara's body, the couple then bought bleach wipes, towels, and cleaning liquid to remove the blood from inside the vehicle and then went to dinner. According to the arrest affidavit, Elytte said the couple killed LaFerrara because they just wanted to murder someone together.[10]\nAccording to police, the Barbours initially denied even knowing LaFerrara, but police traced the last call from LaFerrara's phone to Miranda's phone. As the investigation developed, the couple's stories allegedly changed from Miranda's story of self-defense to a mutual confession to premeditated murder.[11] The killing allegedly was a thrill killing, timed for three weeks after the couple's wedding, police have said.\nMiranda Barbour, 19, and Elytte Barbour, 22, pled not guilty to first-degree murder charges that carried a possible death penalty upon conviction. Both plead out to second-degree murder in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison.\nIn an interview with the Sunbury Daily Item, Miranda Barbour claimed she was molested by a relative at the age of four. Barbour's mother confirmed that Miranda's uncle was charged with sexual abuse of a minor and sentenced to 19 years in prison.[15] Barbour claimed that she joined a satanic cult at the age of 13 and soon after committed her first murder when the cult leader forced her to shoot a man indebted to their cult.[15] She claimed to be responsible for the deaths of \"at least 22 people\" between 2008 and 2013.[16][17]  This claim triggered worldwide media attention and led to investigations of the claim by the FBI and other police forces.[2]\nA Northumberland County District Attorney told The Daily Item that he was skeptical of Miranda's claims, saying \"We have been in contact with other law enforcement agencies where she has lived and haven't received any information verifying what she said.\"[18] The Alaska State Troopers released a statement saying they have no evidence Barbour committed any murders during her time in Alaska.[19]\nElytte Barbour graduated from Triton High School in 2010.[20]\nHe married Miranda (n\u00e9e Dean) on October 22, 2013 when they were residing in Dunn, North Carolina.[20][21]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nOn April 4, 2009, a shootout occurred at 1016 Fairfield Street[2] in the Stanton Heights neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, stemming from a mother and her 22-year-old son's argument over a dog urinating in the house.[3] At approximately 7:11\u00a0a.m. EDT, 22-year-old Richard Poplawski opened fire on two Pittsburgh Police officers responding to a 9-1-1 call from Poplawski's mother, who was attempting to get the police officers to remove her son from the home.[3] Despite Poplawski's mother telling the 9-1-1 operator that Poplawski had guns, the police officers were not told.[4]  Three police officers were ultimately confirmed dead, and another two were seriously injured.[5]\nAccording to Pittsburgh Police Chief Nathan Harper, Poplawski was armed with a semi-automatic AK-47-style rifle, a Savage 67 12-gauge shotgun, a .22-caliber Mossberg 702 Plinkster semi-automatic rifle and two handguns (a 4-inch Dan Wesson Model 14 .357 Magnum revolver and a .380-caliber Bersa Thunder 380 handgun), protected by a bulletproof vest, and had been lying in wait for the officers.[5]  According to police and witnesses, he held police at bay for four hours as the fallen officers were left bleeding nearby, their colleagues unable to reach them. More than 600 rounds were fired by the SWAT teams and Poplawski.\nThe victims were the first Pittsburgh city officers killed in the line of duty in 18 years.[5] The incident was the third-deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 attacks, following a 2016 mass shooting in Dallas, Texas;[6][7] and a pair of related shootings two weeks earlier in Oakland, California.[8][9]\nOn June 28, 2011, Poplawski was sentenced to death by lethal injection on three counts of murder in the first degree.[10]\nAt 7:03\u00a0a.m., officers Paul Sciullo and Stephen Mayhle of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police responded to a 9-1-1 call from Poplawski's mother over a domestic disturbance.  When the officers arrived at the scene, the mother answered the door, explaining that she wanted Poplawski out of the house. As the two officers entered the home, Poplawski was reportedly wearing a bulletproof vest and \"lying in wait\". Sciullo was immediately shot in the head. Almost immediately thereafter, Officer Mayhle was also shot in the head.[5]\nOfficer Eric Kelly, on his way home after completing his overnight shift, heard the call for help and arrived at the scene. Poplawski then shot Kelly as he was attempting to aid Sciullo and Mayhle. Officer Timothy McManaway arrived at the scene and was shot in the hand while attempting to pull Kelly to safety, after he saw Kelly wave at him. McManaway sought cover and returned fire. Another officer, Brian Jones, suffered a broken leg when a fence he was climbing collapsed. A short time later, more officers, SWAT team members, and other law enforcement officers arrived and were fired on as well.[5]\nA neighbor who witnessed the incident reported \"They couldn't get the scene secure enough to get to them. They were just lying there bleeding, by the time they secured the scene enough to get to them, it was way too late.\"[5]\nThe standoff with police lasted for approximately four hours. Poplawski's friend Edward Perkovic said he got a call at work from Poplawski during which he said, \"Eddie, I am going to die today. ... Tell your family I love them and I love you.\"  Perkovic said \"I heard gunshots and he hung up. ... He sounded like he was in pain, like he got shot.\"[11]\nAccording to the sources, Poplawski was shot in the leg before surrendering to authorities.[12]\nPoplawski was transported to UPMC Presbyterian after the shooting where he was treated under custody.[13] On April 5, Poplawski was moved from the hospital to the Allegheny County Jail.[14]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Pittsburgh railway strike occurred in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as part of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877. It was one of many incidents of strikes, labor unrest and violence in cities across the United States, including several in Pennsylvania. Other cities dealing with similar unrest included Philadelphia, Reading, Shamokin and Scranton. The incidents followed repeated reductions in wages and sometimes increases in workload by railroad companies, during a period of economic recession following the Panic of 1873.\nBetween July 21 and 22 in Pittsburgh, a major center of the Pennsylvania Railroad, some 40 people (including women and children) were killed in the ensuing riots; strikers burned the Union Depot and 38 other buildings at the yards. In addition, more than 120 locomotives and more than 1,200 rail cars were destroyed. Due to track damage, trains did not run for a week following the cessation of violence. Estimates of losses ranged from $2 million to $5 million, according to the railroad company and an 1878 report by a state legislative investigative committee. Pittsburgh was the site of the most violence and physical damage of any city in the country during the Great Strike. Fresh troops arrived in the city on July 28, and within two days peace had been restored and the trains resumed. \nCommentators would later place blame for the incident on a range of actors, from the railroad, to reluctant or even sympathetic members of the police and militia, to tramps and vagrants who travelled to the city to take part of the growing public unrest. In the immediate aftermath, the events in Pittsburgh and elsewhere help to solidify support for various labor groups, which had struggled during the years of the economic downturn. \nA number of historical markers have since been erected at points throughout the city of Pittsburgh to commemorate events that took place during the strikes.\nThe Long Depression, sparked in the United States by the Panic of 1873, had far-reaching implications for US industry, closing more than a hundred railroads in the first year and cutting construction of new rail lines from 7,500 miles (12,100\u00a0km) of track in 1872, to 1,600 miles (2,600\u00a0km) in 1875.[2]\nApproximately 18,000 businesses failed nationwide between 1873 and 1875, production in iron and steel dropped as much as 45 percent, and a million or more lost their jobs.[3][4] In 1876, 76 railroad companies went bankrupt or entered receivership in the US alone, and the economic impacts rippled through many economic sectors throughout the industrialized world.[5]:\u200a31\u200a\nDuring the summer of 1877, tensions erupted across the nation in what would become known as the Great Railroad Strike, or simply the Great Strikes. Work stoppage was followed by civil unrest across the nation. Violence began in Martinsburg, West Virginia and spread along the rail lines through Baltimore, and on to several major cities and transportation hubs of the time, including Reading, Scranton and Shamokin, Pennsylvania; a bloodless general strike in St. Louis, Missouri; and a short lived uprising in Chicago, Illinois.\nWhat began as the peaceful actions of organized labor attracted the masses of working discontent and unemployed of the depression, along with others who took opportunistic advantage of the chaos. In total, an estimated 100,000 workers participated nationwide.[6] State and federal troops followed the unrest as it spread along the rail lines from city to city.[7][8]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nEvelyn Hoey (December 15, 1910 \u2013 September 11, 1935) was a Broadway theatre torch singer and actress.\nHoey was noted for her performances in Fifty Million Frenchmen and Good News. She began performing at the age of 10 in Minneapolis. As an adult she appeared in London, England and Paris, France. She had one movie credit with a role in the 1930 comedy Leave It To Lester. The film was directed by Frank Cambria and co-starred Lester Allen and Hal Thompson.\nHoey was found shot to death in an upstairs bedroom of oil heir Henry H. Rogers III's Indian Run Farm house, Wallace Township near Downingtown, Pennsylvania in 1935. A bullet was discharged in her brain on the night of September 11. She had been a guest at the home for a week. Others present there during this time were Rogers, photographer William J. Kelley, a Japanese cook, George Yamada, a butler, and Rogers' chauffeur, Frank Catalano. Hoey's body was removed to a morgue in Downingtown. Later the body was taken to the county hospital in West Chester, Pennsylvania for an autopsy.\nRogers was the son of a deceased  millionaire, Colonel Henry Huddleston Rogers Jr., a former Standard Oil executive. Colonel Rogers and his father Henry Huttleston Rogers had made millions in oil, together with the family of John D. Rockefeller. Rogers Jr. left virtually his entire inheritance to his wife, a daughter, and to a son from his daughter's first marriage. Henry H. Rogers III was excluded from the provisions of his father's will through the careful wording of lawyers. He lived on $500,000 annually from a trust fund provided by his father's will. The income was to go to him during his lifetime but would return to the estate when he died.\nRogers left his father's home when he was twenty. He found work in a Cleveland, Ohio machine shop, working for twenty five cents an hour. He wanted to become an engineer and aspired to complete his education in Oxford, England. Rogers eventually went to Hollywood to study camera technique. There he partnered with Harold McCracken to produce pictures. His first film was a comedy concerning nudism. He was estranged from his wife, the former Miss Virginia Lincoln, a physician's daughter from Cleveland. The couple were married in 1929.\nAt a coroner's inquest Rogers and Kelley both insisted they were seated in the living room on the first floor when they heard the shot that caused Hoey's death. Their testimony was supported by Yamada, Catalano, and a farmer who was present when he called to collect some wages he was owed. Rogers and Kelley were discharged by the coroner. They had been under $2,500 bail each. The coroner's jury returned an open verdict that Hoey killed herself in the second floor bedroom.\nIn October 1935 District Attorney William E. Parke requested that a grand jury investigate the fatal shooting of Evelyn Hoey. The prosecutor asked that the shooting be studied as well as the conduct of members of the coroner's jury, and people with whom they had been in contact. Particularly he wanted to identify their association with certain newspaper men who covered the inquest. Parke believed the jury's verdict indicated they felt a homicide had been committed. After asking for a grand jury he said he did not know whether any new evidence had been found.\nA jury of eighteen men and four housewives convened in West Chester on November 12, 1935. Among the witnesses was Hoey's singing coach, Victor Andoga, of New York City. Andoga testified that he believed Hoey committed suicide because of anguish over a love affair with a New York theatrical man. He said that she was also worried that her voice was failing. According to him she twice told him she wanted to end her life. \nHoey confided to Andoga in 1932 that a man wanted to marry her but she was unwilling because of her affection for the theater man. She asked him to test her voice when she returned from a trip to Bermuda in 1934. Hoey disclosed to Andoga that she took the trip with the idea of\nslipping off the ship overboard, but lost her nerve.\n",

She is best known for her role as a USAF lieutenant who was one of two F-16 pilots who flew their unarmed planes in an attempt to ram and down[1] United Airlines Flight 93 before it reached Washington, D.C., during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.[2]\nHeather Penney majored in literature at Purdue University. Her father was retired Air Force Col. John Penney (born 1947), who served from 1970 to 1979 during the Vietnam War and joined United Airlines in 1979 and served until his retirement in 2007.[3]\nPenney was the \"only woman in her fighter pilot training class and the only woman in her fighter squadron\", the 121st Fighter Squadron[4] of the District of Columbia Air National Guard, stationed at Joint Base Andrews.[5] In 2009, she transferred to the 201st Airlift Squadron,[6] which provides short notice worldwide transportation for the Executive Branch, Congressional Members, Department of Defense officials and high-ranking U.S. and foreign dignitaries.\nPenney, who was a first lieutenant at the time, was ordered into the air in her F-16 fighter jet alongside Marc H. Sasseville's aircraft at Andrews Air Force Base as the terrorist attacks were unfolding on September 11, 2001. They were ordered to down United Flight 93 before it reached the Washington, D.C. airspace, but because of the urgency, there was not enough time to outfit their aircraft with live ammunition. The mission could only have been accomplished by ramming the plane with their respective fighter jets. Penney and Sasseville were never able to intercept United 93, as it had crashed at least 35 minutes before they took off, and likely would have reached Washington 15 minutes prior to being airborne.[7] In the Washington Post, Penney described her willingness to down Flight 93 without using live ammunition, saying that \"there are things in this world that are more important than ourselves. [...] We belong to something greater than ourselves. As complex and diverse and discordant as it is, this thing, this idea called America, binds us together in citizenship and community and brotherhood.\"[1][8]\nShe served two tours of duty in the Iraq war.[9]\nIn 2006, Penney joined Lockheed Martin as director of USAF Air Superiority Programs, Aviation Systems, Lockheed Martin Washington Operations[10] while still serving part-time with the Air National Guard. At Lockheed Martin, she was working for Lockheed Martin on the F-35 project.[2] On September 7, 2017, Penney and her father, John Penney, gave a lecture, titled 9/11 Perspectives at National Air and Space Museum, as part of the GE Aviation Lecture Series.[11] After leaving Lockheed in 2018, Penney joined the think tank Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies as a defense policy expert.[12][13]\nIn 2012, Penney received the Emerging Voice Award from the Purdue University College of Liberal Arts and the Purdue Alumni Association.[6] She was given the 2017 Outstanding Aviator Award from The Wings Club Foundation and the International Aviation Womens Association.[14]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Philadelphia Arena was an auditorium used mainly for sporting events located at 46th and Market Streets in West Philadelphia.\nThe address of the building, originally named the Philadelphia Ice Palace and Auditorium, was 4530 Market Street. The building stood next to what would become the WFIL TV studio that broadcast American Bandstand.  It was built by George F. Pawling, of George F. Pawling & Co., Engineers and Contractors, and opened on Saturday, February 14, 1920 with a college hockey game between Yale and Princeton Tigers; the Bulldogs won, 4\u20130, before a crowd of over 4,000[1] despite the fact that the arena had only one small entrance at the time.\nOne of the first teams to make the Arena home was the Yale University men's ice hockey team. Yale did not have a suitable on-campus venue in 1920 and played home games in Philadelphia.[2] During the 1920\u20131921 season, Yale, Princeton, and Penn made the Arena their home ice.[3]\nJules Mastbaum, owner of a movie theater chain (The Stanley Company of America), acquired the building in 1925 and renamed it the Arena.  In 1927 the Arena was purchased by Rudy Fried and Maurice Fishman who operated the facility until 1934, when their partnership was placed in receivership.  In 1929, Peter A. Tyrrell (1896\u20131973) joined the Arena as boxing matchmaker and subsequently became the facility's publicist.  In 1934 Tyrrell was named a friendly receiver-in-equity by George Welsh, a federal judge.  Tyrrell became general manager of the Arena and served in that capacity until 1958, returning the corporation to profitability and enriching the variety of public entertainment.[4]\nThe arena was the site of several historic sporting events, including the professional debut of Sonja Henie, fresh from her triumph in the 1936 Winter Olympics. Roy Rogers, cowboy movie star, performed in his first rodeo at the Philadelphia arena in 1943. The Roy Rogers Rodeo played the Arena every season for more than 20 years, and in 1946, when a young cowgirl died after riding a bucking bronco, her funeral was held there. Rogers and the Sons of Pioneers sang \"Roundup in the Sky\", and after the closing prayer, everybody rode out to the cemetery. It was also the home of the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association Banquet. Professionally, the arena was the home of the Philadelphia Quakers of the NHL in their only season, 1930\u20131931, as well as home ice for several minor league hockey teams such as the Philadelphia Arrows, Philadelphia Ramblers, the Philadelphia Comets, the Philadelphia Falcons/Philadelphia Rockets and the Philadelphia Ramblers (EHL), as well as the Philadelphia Warriors and part-time home of the Philadelphia 76ers of the NBA when the Philadelphia Convention Center was unavailable.\nThe arena was also a major venue for boxing and wrestling before the opening of the Spectrum. Throughout the history of the Arena, such legends as Sugar Ray Robinson, Lew Tendler, Gene Tunney, Joe Frazier, Jack Delaney, and Primo Carnera fought there. Several championship wrestling matches occurred there, both for the NWA and the WWWF (including Stan Stasiak winning the WWWF championship belt in 1973, the only time until 1977 the belt ever changed hands outside of Madison Square Garden). Roller Derby also was held there, through the team named the Philadelphia Warriors, not connected with the basketball team, owned by Bill Griffiths, the owner of the Los Angeles Thunderbirds and Roller Games.\n\"Didja Get Any Onya?\" on the album Weasels Ripped My Flesh by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention was recorded at this venue on March 2, 1969.\nThe Arena was not used as much for political and other events, as those events tended to be held at Convention Hall.  However, many of the city's mayoral inauguration parties were held there.  Evangelist Billy Sunday spoke there, and before the United States entered World War II, Charles A. Lindbergh gave a speech before an America First Committee Meeting.\nIn 1947 the Arena was sold to Triangle Publications, along with the NBA franchise and the Philadelphia Warriors Basketball team.  This transaction made TV station WFIL-TV (Channel 6), owned by Triangle Publications, the first joint ownership of a major professional sports team and TV station.  In 1958, a group headed by Tyrrell purchased the Arena from the Walter Annenberg Foundation, to which ownership had been transferred by Triangle Publications.  At the time of Tyrrell's retirement in 1965, the Arena building was sold at auction to James Toppi Enterprises, a sports promotion concern.\n",

The perpetrators included a girl he was dating and his best friend since childhood. Due to the manner in which Sweeney was murdered, the ages of the teens involved, and the seeming indifference of the perpetrators, the crime received national media coverage.[2]\nJason Sweeney left school and was working for his father, a contractor, on a building project in Philadelphia. He recently met a girl he liked, 15-year-old Justina Morley, with whom he had a date on the evening of Friday, May 30, 2003. Unbeknownst to Sweeney, Morley engaged in sexual relations with two other 16-year-olds, Nicholas Coia and Edward Batzig Jr.[3] Batzig was Sweeney's best friend since the fourth grade. Nicholas Coia and his 17-year-old brother, Domenic Coia, were also friends with Sweeney, but the brothers later ended the friendship.[4]\nWith the promise of sex, Morley lured Sweeney to \"The Trails,\" a wooded area of Fishtown near the Delaware River, where Batzig and the Coia brothers were lying in wait. Batzig took the first blow, striking Sweeney in the head four or five times.[5]  Batzig and the Coia brothers then pummeled Sweeney, primarily on his head and face, with a hatchet, a hammer and a rock until he was dead. Batzig later told a detective how he hit Sweeney with the hatchet face four or five times. Batzig said, \"Jason started begging for his life, but we just kept hitting him.\"[6] Batzig also said that Sweeney looked at him during the beating and said, \u201cPlease stop, I'm bleeding,\" after which Batzig hit Sweeney again with the axe.[citation needed] They finished by dropping a boulder on the right side of his head.[7] Sweeney's head was crushed and the only bone left undamaged was his left cheekbone.[8] He was identified by a cut on his hand that he sustained at his construction job.[citation needed]\nFollowing Sweeney's murder, the four assailants stole the $500 cash he earned from work.[7] Before leaving the crime scene, the Coias, Batzig and Morley shared a group hug and split the money, which they used to buy jewelry and illegal drugs\u2014heroin, marijuana, and Xanax\u2014and then \"partied beyond redemption,\" according to Domenic.[6][9]\nDomenic Coia confessed in a court hearing that they were all involved in the murder of Sweeney. The police said the murder was planned days before. Part of the preparation of the murder was listening to the Beatles song \"Helter Skelter\" over forty times, prompting later news coverage to draw a parallel to the Manson family murders.[2][6] Joshua Staab, 18, a friend of Domenic Coia, said that the group bragged about their plan to kill Sweeney by using Justina Morley as \"bait.\" Staab also said that Batzig knew that Sweeney would have his paycheck earnings on him on the day of the murder. The prosecutor asked Staab about the teens' demeanor after the killing. Staab said, \"They seemed pretty fine. In a way, happy.\"[6]\nAlthough all four teens involved in the murder were drug addicts, they were not high before they murdered Sweeney. In response to a detective's question about whether they were high during the killing, Domenic Coia answered, \"No, I was as sober as I am now. It is sick, isn't it?\"[6] A detective involved in the case and a forensic psychologist later opined that the killers' motivation went beyond robbery and stemmed from envy and resentment of Sweeney's relative success in life.[10]\nIn his memoir, Domenic Coia gave a different account of the murder. Domenic claimed he panicked when Batzig actually hit Sweeney and only participated when he feared him and his brother getting caught. He also denies stating he was sober during the attack and states he later prevented them from killing Justina Morley as they feared she would testify. He also denies involvement in any plans for the murder before the day it happened.\nJustina Morley claimed that she started smoking marijuana at the age of 10, and shortly thereafter started taking prescription pills and snorting cocaine. April Frederick, Morley's mother, said her daughter started cutting her wrists at the age of 10. Morley was hospitalized for threatening suicide and self-mutilation in 2002. She was once admitted to Friends Hospital for cutting her wrists, knees and thighs, taking pills and displaying a suicide poem, which she penned on her door. Morley told her mother that she would commit suicide if her mother did not take her out of the hospital; her mother then took her out against the hospital's advice. Morley was expelled from public school in the eighth grade, which she then repeated at the private Holy Name of Jesus Catholic school in Fishtown.\nA psychiatrist hired by the defense team, William Russell, said the reason Morley began sexual activity at an early age \"was an attempt at validation of self-worth\". Morley testified that she had sex with both Nicholas Coia and Batzig in exchange for heroin just a few days before they murdered Sweeney.\nMorley was released on Dec. 20, 2020.\n[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJoseph Augustus Zarelli (January 13, 1953[4] \u2013 February 1957), previously known as the \"Boy in the Box\" and \"America's Unknown Child\", was a boy whose naked, extensively beaten body was found on the side of Susquehanna Road, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 25, 1957. Joseph appeared to have been cleaned and freshly groomed, with a recent haircut and trimmed fingernails, although he had suffered extensive physical abuse before he died, with multiple bruises on his body. Joseph was also found to be malnourished. The body was covered with scars, some of which were surgical (most notably on his ankle, groin, and chin). The police believe that the cause of death was homicide by blunt force trauma.[5]\nDespite the publicity and sporadic interest throughout the years, the boy's identity remained unknown for decades. On November 30, 2022, the Philadelphia Police Department announced that detectives had determined the boy's identity using DNA and genealogical databases.[5][6] On December 8, 2022, more than 65 years after his body was found, the boy was publicly identified as Joseph Augustus Zarelli during a press conference held by Philadelphia Police Department.\nOn February 25, 1957,[7] Zarelli's body, wrapped in a plaid blanket, was found in the woods off Susquehanna Road in Fox Chase, Philadelphia.[8] The body was discovered by a young man who was checking his muskrat traps. Fearing that the police would confiscate his traps, he did not report what he had found.[9] A few days later, a college student spotted a rabbit running into the underbrush. Knowing that there were animal traps in the area, he stopped his car to investigate and discovered the body. He was also reluctant to have any contact with the police, but he did report what he had found the following day, after hearing of the disappearance of Mary Jane Barker.[10][9]\nThe naked body was inside a cardboard box that had once contained a bassinet of the kind sold by J. C. Penney.[8][11] Zarelli's hair had been recently cropped, possibly after death, as clumps of hair clung to the body. There were signs of severe malnourishment, as well as surgical scars on the ankle and groin, and an L-shaped scar under the chin.[12]\nThe police received the report and opened an investigation on February 26, 1957. The dead boy's fingerprints were taken, and police at first were optimistic that he would soon be identified. However, no one ever came forward with any useful information.[8]\nThe case attracted considerable media attention in Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley. The Philadelphia Inquirer printed 400,000 flyers depicting the boy's likeness, which were sent out and posted across the area, and were included with every gas bill in Philadelphia.[12] The crime scene was combed over and over again by 270 police academy recruits, who discovered a man's blue corduroy cap, a child's scarf, and a man's white handkerchief with the letter \"G\" in the corner; all clues that led nowhere.[12][13] The police also distributed a post-mortem photograph of the boy fully dressed and in a seated position, as he may have looked in life, in the hope it might lead to a clue.[12]\nIn 1998, his body was exhumed for the purpose of extracting DNA, which was obtained from a tooth.[14] On March 21, 2016, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children released a forensic facial reconstruction of the victim and added him into their database.[15] The body was then exhumed yet again in 2019 to retrieve additional DNA samples.[5]\nThe child was an unidentified murder victim for decades. However, on November 30, 2022, the Philadelphia Police Department announced that they had identified the child through the use of genetic testing and investigative genetic genealogy, and that they would provide a case update in the following week.[5] Sources stated that he was the child of a prominent family in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.[16] Authorities said that the investigation will use this new information to continue to search for suspects.[16] On December 8, 2022, the child was publicly identified as 4-year-old Joseph Augustus Zarelli, born on January 13, 1953. Genealogists had uncovered his name more than a year earlier, in October 2021.[17] On January 19, 2023, the names of Zarelli's parents were reported.[18]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Philadelphia Election Riot in 1742 was a riot that occurred due to political disagreements among the constituents of the increasingly diverse population in the city.[1] Politics in Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia, had long been dominated by the Quakers but, with their political dominance increasingly threatened by the predominantly Anglican Proprietary Party, tensions grew in the city. The Quakers and Anglicans were predominantly led by Isaac Norris II and William Allen, both of whom were well respected and held significant political power.[2] In an attempt to swing the vote, the Proprietary Party \"hired armed sailors\" to disrupt the Quakers who, in their own attempt, were bringing \"unnaturalized Germans from the country to vote.\"[3] On voting day, October 1, 1742, violence broke out between the two sides.\nThe Quakers had dominated the political landscape of Philadelphia for years and the growing German population seemed to be a means by which they could continue this domination. Realizing this, John Kinsey and, particularly, Isaac Norris II led the Quakers in attempting to convince the Germans to vote along with their interests.[4] Attempts to persuade the increasing German population seemed to be paying off, as voter turnout tripled between 1739 and 1740.[5] The German population found the Pacifism of the Quakers attractive, as the former saw it as protection from the draft and high taxes.[5] However, John Isaac also drew the Germans to their cause by making property available to them, in addition to doing regular business with the Germans.[4]\nAlthough the Quakers had won the favor of the German citizens, they, like the Anglicans, resented the Germans who had begun migrating to the colony after 1715.[6] By the 1750s, the German population of Pennsylvania had increased greatly, with 40% of the colony's constituents being German.[6] Throughout the same decade, the German vote was effectively split and didn't play much of a role in elections; however, that began to change in the 1760s, when the Propriety Party began to recruit the equally disliked Dutch to their side, and the Quakers saw it necessary to redouble their efforts to gain the support of the Germans.[6] The Germans were much more fond of farming than politics, thus, rather than striving to gain political power themselves, they fancied their position as swing voters, as it ensured that they would also benefit from those who needed their support.[6]\nFailing to win the favor of the German vote, William Allen and his fellow Anglicans sought to amend the election process by reviving a 1739 election law that provided party-specific election inspectors.[7] In part, this was because of the distrust of the Quakers which derived from their prior electoral day transgressions. The Quakers, from 1739 to 1741, had taken advantage of the voting process. The election official would collect the filled out ballot from the citizen and run it upstairs to the counting area, by blocking the stairs and only allowing favorable ballots through.[4] Allen hoped that the revival of the election law would allow for a fair vote. However, the two sides could not agree on the means by which to guarantee a fair election and, as such, distrust grew between the two sides.[4]\nWith election day coming fast, both sides had damning rumors swirling around their respective camps. The Quakers believed that the Anglicans were going to attack the polls with a large number of vigilantes, which they were, as a few dozen sailors had been hired.[5][4] On the other hand, the Anglicans believed that the Quakers were upping their effort to obstruct the voting officials by bringing even more Germans, which they were, and other citizens who were seen as unqualified to vote.[4]\nOn October 1, 1742, the \"Bloody Election,\" as scholars refer to it, led to an outbreak of violence between the Quakers and Proprietary Party. The voting was to take place in the \"Market Place\" for the City of Philadelphia and Philadelphia County elections at 9:00\u00a0am, and city officials had asked that no weapons be carried due to a fear of violence.[4] At the polls, the two sides debated once more over who should be the inspectors of the election.[7] While the debate was occurring, about fifty to eighty sailors carrying blunt objects, mostly clubs, gathered among the crowd.[4] Just as Isaac Norris II was chosen as an inspector, the mob of sailors violently assaulted the crowd.[4]\nEven though the sailors were destroying property and injuring many, when Allen was asked to call the sailors off, he claimed they had as much right to be there as the Dutch and Germans.[4] Eventually, German and Dutch citizens picked up makeshift weapons of their own to beat back the assailant sailors, who retreated to their ships.[4]\nWilliam Allen was widely blamed for the riots and, thus, the riot politically benefitted the Quakers, who did better in the coming elections, as the Anglican's Proprietary Party lost the election in a landslide.[4] Reports show that many voters had altered their original ballots, crossing out their original vote for the Proprietary Party and instead voting for the Quaker Party.[3]\nFifty-four sailors and party leaders were jailed. Allen, the Proprietary leader, in an effort to clear his name, sued one of the Quaker leaders for claiming that Allen had planned the assault. The matter was turned over to the Quaker-led Assembly (over Allen's objections) for investigation. The Assembly cast the investigation as the result of public outcry, when it is likely none truly existed.[3] After questioning 49 witnesses, most of whom were Quakers and included none of the sailors, the Assembly ruled that Allen, his business partner, the mayor, and two others (all Anglicans) should be investigated for being negligent in their duties and subverting the Pennsylvania Charter. Allen was ruled the instigator of the riot. After months of investigation, they turned the matter over to the Quaker-controlled Supreme Court.[3]\n",

They had been suffocated, presumably by Elmo Noakes (father of Dewilla and Cordelia, and stepfather of Norma).\nThe next day, Elmo shot and killed his 18-year-old niece Winifred Pierce, then himself with a .22 rifle.[2]\nDiscovery of the girls' bodies started a nationwide media frenzy resulting in many false leads as to the identities of the girls. Photographs of the children lying on a blanket were printed in newspapers across the country. Thousands came to view the bodies in hopes of identifying them.\nDeath masks were made before burial to aid in the search for the girls' identities. Some clothing, towels, and children's books were found, but labels which may have contained their names had been torn off. Only the name \"Norma\" was found in one of the children's books.\nNoakes and Pierce were found over 100 miles away, near Altoona, Pennsylvania the day after discovery of the girls' bodies. Pierce had a gunshot wound to the heart and another to the head. Noakes had a single gunshot wound to the head.\nUsing the description of the car, the reasoning for this identification the physical features of the dead girls, and Elmo Noakes' fingerprints on military records, the bodies were identified.[10]\nThere are many theories which purport to account for the tragedy.\nEarly speculations included a cult killing due to a \"sign\" or mystic symbol found upon the head of Norma Sedgwick.

Daugherty, who was mentally disabled, was tortured and murdered before being wrapped in Christmas decorations, put inside a garbage can, and dumped in the parking lot of Greensburg-Salem Middle School.\nAmber Meidinger met Melvin Knight at a homeless shelter in Washington in January 2010. They moved to several locations before settling in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where they met Jennifer Daugherty.[1] Knight met Ricky Smyrnes after meeting previously in jail.[2]\nMelvin L. Knight (born October 27, 1989)[3] was born to a drug-addicted father who was imprisoned during the early years of his life. He developed lifelong learning and social problems after he fell out of a moving vehicle and hit his head at age 5.[4]\nAngela Lynn Marinucci (born July 14, 1992),[3] according to testimony by her mother and half-sister, Marinucci suffered a head injury when she was hit by a truck in 2008, at the age of 15. The injury substantially altered her behavior and pushed her into a downward spiral that ended with Daugherty\u2019s death, according to the defense. Two mental experts testified that Marinucci as a child, suffered from depression and that she may have had drug and alcohol addictions as a teenager.[5]\nMeidinger told jurors, \"at some point, she [Daugherty] trusted me because she knew me from the West Place (a center for people with special needs).\" Meidinger testified she and her then-boyfriend and co-defendant Melvin Knight met Smyrnes on February 8, 2010, after she and Knight had been staying at a Greensburg-area hotel. Knight and Smyrnes knew each other after meeting in jail, and Meidinger was pregnant with Knight's child when all three met up. Smyrnes offered Meidinger and Knight to stay at his apartment at 428 N. Pennsylvania Avenue in Greensburg.[6]\nRicky Ven Edward Smyrnes (born March 6, 1986)[3] was born to a drug-addicted Philadelphia sex worker and a Pittsburgh gang member. He was moved into and out of foster homes as a child and was treated for mental health disorders as early as age 4. He suffered abuse and neglect until he was taken in by the Smyrnes family in North Huntingdon at age 10, according to testimony by forensic psychologist Alice Applegate.[7] His lawyer, Terri Fayes, told the jury that Smyrnes suffered sexual and physical abuse from his father and his uncle. She also explained how he had tried beer, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana by age 6, had been diagnosed with PTSD at age 8, and had undergone 103 therapy sessions by age 10. She added he was diagnosed as having as many as seven different personalities, and 15 total psychiatric issues. In 1997, he burglarized his neighbor's home and stole knives, guitars, coins, bullets, and cash. That same year, he sexually assaulted a woman in her basement.[8]\nAccording to a testimony by Meidinger, the group went through her purse and stole money, gift cards, and her cell phone. They poured liquids into her bag, hit her head with filled soda bottles, cut her hair, painted her face with nail polish, and dumped liquid and spices on her head. Meidinger said she and Angela Marinucci took turns violently hitting Daugherty with a metal towel rack and crutches. She also noted that Daugherty was stripped naked, gagged, and raped by Knight.[1] They also forced her to consume feces, urine, and detergent.[9][10] Meidinger also said Knight took Daugherty to the living room where Marinucci poured a bottle of water over Daugherty's head and Knight and Smyrnes dumped oatmeal and spices on her head. Daugherty said that her eyes were burning, and Smyrnes told her to take a shower because she smelled bad.[2]\nAccording to her relatives, Daugherty had the mental abilities of an adolescent, trusted everyone, and thought that the suspects were her \"friends.\"[11]\n",

An $80 million construction program completed in 1989 added a new administration building, a 28-bed infirmary, and 372 additional cells.\nAs recently as 1978 the prison held only about 1,600 prisoners in 2,000 available cells distributed among five major cellblocks of 400 cells each. The five major cellblocks were supplemented by about 40 cells in a security unit known as BAU (Behavior Adjustment Unit) or RHU (Restricted Housing Unit); this unit included a special death row section (though executions were never carried out at this prison). The original 1929 plan for the facility included eight major cellblocks of 400 cells each, or 3,200 individual cells. An engraving of this plan is found on a brass plaque just inside the facility's double-gated airlock-type main entrance.\nThe prison's two current Restricted Housing Units (RHU) are essentially prisons within a prison and house over 300 prisoners \u2014 about 10 percent of the total prison population - who are allowed one hour a day for exercise, remaining confined to their cells the other 23, where they receive three meals a day and are permitted shower visits. The prisoners in RHU are allowed only one visitor per month. SCI-Graterford has a 22-bed Mental Health Unit contracted to MHM Services to facilitate a mental health program.\nSCI-Graterford Industries provides work and economic activity within the prison, including a garment factory, undergarment factory, shoe factory, weave plant, hosiery factory, carton factory, and a mail distribution center. Prison factories and industries employ 21 civilian staff, 315 inmate staff, and in 2003\u20132004 generated revenues of $4,450,940.01. The prison also conducts farming operations and educational programs.\nIn the final period of operations, Cynthia Link, the superintendent of Graterford and the prospective superintendent of Graterford's replacement facility, SCI Phoenix, resigned and retired.[7] Laurel Harry, previously the superintendent of SCI Camp Hill, became the interim superintendent.[8]\nSCI Phoenix opened in July 2018.[9] The state began moving Graterford prisoners there on July 11, 2018, and Graterford ended operations on July 15, 2018.[10] All Graterford employees became Phoenix employees.[4] Some inmates disliked the move as they feared they would be sharing cells with other inmates, while at Graterford they had single cells.[11] The population of Graterford was reduced so the transfer of inmates to Phoenix would not involve as many people.[12]\n",

About 26 percent of the city's Jewish population live in the area.[18][19][20]\nOriginally founded as an Orthodox Jewish congregation in 1864 in downtown Pittsburgh, by an early group of Jewish immigrants, Tree of Life merged in 2010 with the recently founded Congregation Or L'Simcha.[21] The modern synagogue building, located at the intersection of Wilkins and Shady avenues in Squirrel Hill, was built in 1953. The congregation also rents space to Dor Hadash,[b] a Reconstructionist congregation; and New Light, another Conservative congregation.[22][23][24] The synagogue's main sanctuary has a capacity of 1,250 people.[25]\nSquirrel Hill has a low crime rate and is not generally regarded as racially tense. However, local rabbinic student Neal Rosenblum was murdered in the neighborhood in 1986 in an antisemitic hate crime.[26]\nThis 2018 mass shooting took place soon after Columbia University and the Anti-Defamation League independently reported a spike in antisemitic activity online, especially on the popular social networking platforms Instagram and Twitter.[27][28][29][30] In addition, other antisemitic acts had been committed elsewhere.[31]\nThe immediate rise in the months of August to October 2018 was attributed to rising tensions associated with advertising for the 2018 US midterm elections.[32] A similar rise in online attacks had occurred during the 2016 US election,[27] with the midterms being a \"rallying point\" for far-right extremists to organize efforts to spread antisemitism online among the populace.[28] In 2017 there was a 57% rise in antisemitic incidents in the United States,[30][29] in context of rising hate crimes against other groups, including Muslims and African Americans, as reported by the FBI.[30] For instance, hundreds of Jewish gravestones were vandalized in Pennsylvania and Missouri,[28] and antisemitic incidents on university campuses doubled in number.[31]\nIn August 2017, the widely publicized Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia featured Nazi symbols, salutes, and the slogan \"Blood and Soil\",[31] amid explicit racist and antisemitic rhetoric. Considerable antisemitic material was being spread online via posted conspiracy theories about wealthy Jewish individuals, including billionaire George Soros. Columbia University's Jon Albright said that these represented the \"worst sample\" of all the hate speech he had seen on Instagram.[27]\n",

Shortly before 1:00\u00a0a.m., 24-year-old Randy Stair barricaded the exits of the store and proceeded to shoot and kill three of his co-workers before fatally shooting himself.[1]\nRandy Stair, 24, arrived for his late-night shift at Weis Markets in Eaton Township, Pennsylvania (just south of Tunkhannock), on the evening of June 7, 2017, during closing time at approximately 11:00\u00a0p.m. Stair went to the back of the store to the crew area and blocked an emergency exit at the far back of the store. He then continued with his duties, stocking shelves and cleaning up from the previous day. At 12:10\u00a0a.m., he sent out links to multiple files and videos which detailed his plans via his Twitter account; these files were labeled \"Journal\", \"Suicide Tapes\", and \"Digital set\".[2][3][4]\nStair then went back to the crew area in the rear of the store, blocked the remaining exits, then locked the automatic doors at the main entrance to the store. He then pulled out two pistol grip pump-action shotguns that he had concealed in a duffel bag[5] and walked around the store and killed three employees\u2014Victoria Brong, Brian Hayes, and Terry Lee Sterling. He then approached another coworker, Kristan Newell, who had not heard the shooting due to her listening to music with headphones on while she was labeling items and stocking shelves near the rear of the store.[6] Stair was seen on CCTV surveillance camera footage standing behind Newell as she worked for about five seconds before he proceeded to the next aisle.[7]\nAfter this, Stair proceeded to fire at a glass and other merchandise in the store and shot multiple small portable propane tanks, which failed to explode.   Around this time, Newell was able to escape the store by removing the display at the entry doors and breaking the glass door. She then ran outside and hid behind some bushes and called 911.\nAfter a short time, Stair concluded his shooting of the store's contents. Stair then went to the deli section of the store, and shot another group of items. Whilst Newell was on the phone to the police, Stair placed the loaded shotgun in his mouth and fired a single round through his palate, killing himself instantly. A total of 59 shots had been fired. All of the shotgun rounds fired came from only one of the two shotguns he brought. Stair stated in his fifth \"Suicide Tape\" that the second shotgun was only for backup in case the first one \"breaks down on [him] or jams, and [he has] no way of fixing it\".\nAll three were employed by Weis Markets\nRandy Robert Stair (September 17, 1992 \u2013 June 8, 2017), who called himself Andrew Blaze, worked at Weis Markets for seven years prior to the shootings. He had kept detailed videos, recordings, and journals leading up to the shooting, most of which he uploaded to online forums and social media profiles just prior. In these writings and videos, he expressed his willingness to commit suicide, addressed the personal tragedies and other misfortunes he experienced which led him to a state of depression, described cross-dressing and questioning his gender identity, provided detailed explanations of his plans for carrying out the shooting, and explained his belief that these murders would allow him to cross over to an animated world he had imagined. Stair also had a fascination with multiple mass shootings, specifically school shootings (particularly the Columbine High School massacre and its perpetrators). In his writings, Stair called the Columbine shooters his heroes, wishing he could have met them, and said Eric was his idol out of the two boys.[10][11][12]\nFrom 2007, Stair had a presence on YouTube with his channel PioneersProductions, which featured short sketches and collaborations he had done with other content creators.[4] By 2014, however, he announced that he was going in a different direction with his content, citing numerous unfortunate events that had occurred in his life during the previous year; this led to the creation of Ember's Ghost Squad (EGS), a fan-based animated series focused on a fictional organization based on the Nickelodeon animated series Danny Phantom due to his obsession with the character Ember McLain.[citation needed]\nOn the evening of June 7, 2017, Stair uploaded a final video titled \"The Westborough High Massacre\" hours before perpetrating the shooting. In it, he described his hatred towards the people involved with the series through an angry prologue. It then featured a crudely animated sequence depicting him and one of the characters from EGS murdering students at a fictional high school, before ending with montages of previous videos explaining the motives behind the shooting.[13] He also managed nine Twitter accounts based on his characters, where he left links to journals and videos he uploaded on MediaFire.[14] He was living in nearby Dallas, Pennsylvania, with his parents and had lived in Pennsylvania all of his life.[15]\n",

Soon after leaving port, Baker seized control of the ship with two other crewmen, Peter LaCroix and Joseph Berrouse, attacking the first mate during night watch and throwing him overboard. Wounding the Captain, a William Wheland, the three held him hostage while they discussed how to sell the cargo. As none of the sailors were able to navigate the ship, they accepted an offer from Wheland to sail them to the \"Spanish Main\" so they could rendezvous with other pirates in order to sell the cargo at a port.\nAlthough promising to spare Wheland's life in exchange for sailing the ship to a haven, Baker reportedly bragged to LaCroix and Berrouse that he planned to kill him once in sight of land. After a time however, Wheland managed to surprise his captors, locking LaCroix and Berrouse in the ship's hold when they were below decks taking inventory of the ship's cargo. Sneaking up behind Baker, who was at the wheel, Wheland chased Baker up the mainmast and forced him to lash himself to the mast.\nSailing into Saint Kitts, Wheland turned the mutineers over to the American naval authorities, who transported the three on USS\u00a0Ganges back to Philadelphia. There a United States circuit court tried them for murder and piracy. The court convened from April 21\u201325, 1800 and sentenced the prisoners to death by hanging. The execution took place on May 9, reportedly to the cheers of the large number of spectators.\n",

He was best known for his appearances on the U.S. independent circuit with promotions such as Eastern Championship Wrestling, Combat Zone Wrestling, Atomic Championship Wrestling, Classic Championship Wrestling, 1CW (Delaware) and Valour Pro Wrestling.\nWilliams trained as a professional wrestler under The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson), debuting in December 1988 as Rockin' Rebel. In 1989 , Williams made a few appearances in the World Wrestling Federation losing to Honky Tonk Man and Brutus Beefcake. In 1990, Rockin' Rebel signed with the Philadelphia-based Tri-State Wrestling Alliance. While touring with the TWA, Rebel became the first Tri- State Champion and had memorable feuds with The Sandman, D.C. Drake, and C.N. Redd. He also teamed with Jimmy Jannetty to form The Confederacy. They became top contenders to the tag team titles and feuded with teams such as The Super Destroyers and The Blackharts. Despite its success, the TWA ceased operations abruptly in 1991. Rebel returned to the promotion in early 1993 after it had been renamed Eastern Championship Wrestling.\nRockin' Rebel hit the independent circuit after leaving ECW in 1995. He then had a brief stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and numerous dark matches with the then called World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He had successful tours of Japan, Korea and Puerto Rico before returning to the U.S. in 1996. Throughout the mid-1990s, Rebel and fellow ECW alum Glen Osbourne formed a successful tag team known as Darkside. Together they won the Maryland-based Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation tag team titles five times, the Virginia-based International Pro Wrestling Association tag team titles twice, and appeared regularly for the NWA. On July 25, 2000, Rockin' Rebel debuted in Combat Zone Wrestling. He joined Lobo's Army and remained in the stable until it dissolved upon Lobo's retirement. He then formed a stable known as Rebel's Army with Derrick Frazier, Doomsday Danny Rose and former Tough Enough contestant Greg Matthews. Rebel and Matthews continued to team together in many promotions around the independent circuit such as PWF, 3PW, PWU, and World-1. Between 2003 and 2005, Rockin' Rebel made numerous appearances with Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling. He later wrestled for numerous independent federations, he wrestled his last match on May 10, 2014 for JCW in a losing effort against Q. T. Marshall.[2] He was inducted into the DWF and IWPF halls of fame in 2012, and the ACW, MWF, and 1CW halls in 2014.[citation needed]\nIn the 1990s, Williams was arrested for holding his wife Stephanie hostage in a closet with a firearm to her head, also threatening to kill himself.[3]\nWilliams died at home in West Chester in the early hours of June 1, 2018.[4] On June 2, the West Goshen Township Police Department said he shot and killed his wife before shooting himself. His 10-year-old children found their bodies the next morning.[5] On June 21, 2018, Kyros Law announced that Williams' family decided to donate his brain for CTE research.[6]\n",

Her car was left running, with the lights on and driver's side door open, on the Exit 5 off-ramp of Interstate 476. Her body was found the next day in North Philadelphia, 17 miles away. She had been beaten to death with a tire iron. The beating was so savage that her skull had multiple fractures.[2] The then-unsolved crime was featured on Unsolved Mysteries and later as a solved one on Cold Case Files and The New Detectives. The story of her murder and investigation was also featured on an episode of Forensic Files as well as in the film The Dark Side of Parole.\nThe case went cold for nearly two years when many theories and suspects were investigated.[3] The case was re-opened when another woman in Pennsylvania was hit from behind while driving alone at night. The other vehicle's driver tried to get her to stop, but the woman refused and instead memorized his license plate number. That plate was registered to Arthur Bomar, but the car belonged to Maria Cabuenos, another Pennsylvania woman who had been reported missing in March 1998. Bomar's actual car was later found at a junkyard. The burn pattern found on Willard's back was consistent with the oil pan on the bottom of Bomar's car. Moreover, Willard's blood and hair were found in Bomar\u2019s car.\nWith DNA evidence, Arthur Bomar was identified as Willard's killer. He was an ex-convict convicted of second-degree murder in 1979 in Nevada; he was paroled 11 years later.[4] Bomar had repeatedly violated his parole but was never returned to Nevada to finish his sentence, due to that state's failure to arrange and finance extradition.\nBomar was convicted of first-degree murder, rape, assault, kidnapping, and abuse of a corpse and was sentenced to death.[5][6]  He was never charged with the murder of Maria Cabuenos, whose skeletal remains were found after his conviction.[7] It is theorized that on the night of her murder, Bomar hit Willard's car in order to force her to pull over. Bomar, to this day, denies any role in the crimes, claiming he was a target of racism.[8]\nWillard was a star lacrosse player at the Academy of Notre Dame de Namur in Villanova, Pennsylvania, and later at George Mason University from 1994 to 1996 (the first three seasons in program history). In 1996, Willard led the Colonial Athletic Association in scoring fifty goals and twenty-nine assists in lacrosse. She was named to the All-Conference Team in both soccer and lacrosse,[9] and to the All-American team for the Southeast region in lacrosse that year. In total, she scored 96 goals and recorded 36 assists for the lacrosse team. At the end of the 1996 season (her third), she held the school records for most goals in a game (7), most goals in a season (50), career goals, most points in a game (8), most points in a season (68), and most career points (132).[10] US Lacrosse has created a national award in her honor.[11]\nBecause of the bureaucratic issues which allowed Bomar to remain free to commit these crimes, The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (H.R. 3244), better known as \"Aimee's Law,\" was passed by the US Congress by a vote of 90\u20135 in 2000 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on October 28, 2000. It encourages states to keep murderers, rapists, and child molesters behind bars and holds the state financially accountable if it fails. It allows interstate parole violators to be jailed in their state of residence at the expense of the state where the original offense was committed. It allows offenders to be jailed in another state if circumstances allow.[12][13]\nA small roadside memorial on the exit ramp from Interstate 476 to southbound U.S. Route 1 marks the site where Willard's car was found.\n",

As of the 2020 census, the population was 74,129.[1] Its county seat is Somerset.[2] The county was created from part of Bedford County on April 17, 1795, and named after the county of Somerset in England.\nSomerset County comprises the Somerset, PA micropolitan statistical area, which is included in the Johnstown\u2013Somerset, PA combined statistical area.\nThe county is famous for being the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93, one of the four flights involved in the September 11 attacks, which crashed near the village of Shanksville after the flight's passengers struggled with Al-Qaeda hijackers for control of the plane, which terrorists intended to fly into either the U.S. Capitol or the White House.[3]\nThe Somerset County Amish community is the second oldest Amish community in the world that still exists, established in 1772. It is located in the South of the county around Meyersdale and Springs.\nSouthwestern Pennsylvania began as a huge area called Cumberland County. As population increased, the area was split into smaller counties. Bedford County was formed from part from Cumberland in 1771 and is referred to as \"Old Bedford County\" and contained what are now 20 smaller counties. In 1773 part of Bedford County was split off to form Westmoreland County. In 1787 Bedford County was split in half with the northern part becoming Huntingdon County and the southern part remained as a smaller Bedford County. Somerset County was split off from the western part of Bedford County on 17 April 1795, and the new county's name was taken from Somerset, England.[4] In 1804 the northern half of Somerset County was split off to form Cambria County. No further splits from Somerset County have occurred since 1804.[5]\nGeorge Washington passed through the area of Somerset County on a scouting expedition in late 1753, just before the outbreak of the French and Indian War.[6] The Forbes Road was cut through Somerset County several years later. This 200-mile stretch from Carlisle to what is now Pittsburgh was created by Brigadier General John Forbes in the British Expedition of 1758 to capture the French Fort Duquesne. Forbes Road was one of two great western land routes cut through the wilderness to create supply lines from the east.[7] It was later the primary route of pioneers travelling to the Ohio Country.\nFur trappers and hunters were first to stay in the region. The earliest permanent white settlement in what is now Somerset County is a region known as Turkeyfoot. People of \"The Jersey Settlement\" emigrated from Essex and Morris Counties, New Jersey, about 1770.[8]\nSomerset County gained worldwide attention in 2001 when a hijacked airliner, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed in Stonycreek Township, near the town of Shanksville as part of the September 11 attacks. The first confirmed report of the plane's crash came from Somerset County Airport as reported on NBC's The Today Show.[9] The most likely target of this flight was the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. Flight 93's cockpit voice recorder revealed crew and passengers tried to seize control of the plane from the hijackers after learning through phone calls that Flights 11, 77, and 175 had been crashed into buildings that morning. Once it became evident that the passengers might gain control, the hijackers rolled the plane and intentionally crashed it. Their actions is honored and the crash site, which is the final resting place of the passengers and crew, is now protected as part of the Flight 93 National Memorial, under the care of the National Park System.

The film chronicles the events aboard United Airlines Flight 93,[3] one of the four hijacked flights during the September 11 attacks and the only one not to hit its intended target due to the intervention of passengers and crew.\nThe film attempts to recount the hijacking and subsequent events in the flight with as much veracity as possible (there is a disclaimer that some imagination had to be used) and in real time (from the flight's takeoff). The film was made with the cooperation of many of the passengers' families,[4] though not all agreed to participate.[5]\nUnited 93 premiered on April 26, 2006, at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, a festival founded to celebrate New York City as a major filmmaking center and to contribute towards the long-term recovery of Lower Manhattan.[6] Several family members of the passengers aboard the flight attended the premiere to show their support.\nThe film opened in North America on April 28, 2006, to critical acclaim. Ten percent of the gross income from the three-day opening weekend was promised toward a donation to create a memorial for the flight's victims.[7] The total gross intake of United 93 was $31.4 million in the United States, and $76.3 million worldwide.[2][8] The film also received two Academy Award nominations, including Best Director for Greengrass.\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, four al-Qaeda members, Ziad Jarrah, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Nami and Ahmed al-Haznawi pray in a Newark, New Jersey hotel, and after Jarrah makes a final phone call to his girlfriend, board United Airlines Flight 93, piloted by Captain Jason Dahl and First Officer LeRoy Homer Jr., at Newark International Airport. Among the passengers are Tom Burnett, Todd Beamer, Jeremy Glick,  Richard Guadagno, Louis J. Nacke II, Lauren Grandcolas and Mark Bingham who is the last passenger to board, barely making the flight. United 93 becomes delayed due to airport traffic. Air traffic controllers lose contact with American Airlines Flight 11 which diverts toward New York City and realise it has been hijacked after hearing suspicious transmissions. Shortly after United 93 takes off after its slight delay, Flight 11 crashes into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, and United Airlines Flight 175 is also hijacked and heads toward New York City. Air traffic controllers learn that American Airlines Flight 77 has also been hijacked and watch in horror as United 175 crashes into the South Tower.\nAs the passengers are served breakfast on United 93, Jarrah hesitates to start the hijacking. Via an ACARS message, Dahl and Homer are notified of the WTC attacks and to beware cockpit intrusion. After Nami unsuccessfully urges Jarrah to attack, an impatient Haznawi prepares an artificial bomb in the lavatory. Ghamdi grabs flight attendant Deborah Welsh at knife point and passenger Mark Rothenberg is mortally wounded by Haznawi. As Haznawi and Nami force the passengers to the back of the plane, Ghamdi kills both pilots, despite sending out a mayday call, and Welsh, as Jarrah begins piloting the aircraft, and redirects it towards Washington, D.C., with the intention to crash it into the United States Capitol. Grandcolas (an emergency medical technician) tries to help the dying Rothenberg but Nami berates her. The hijackers jubilantly react to the success of the WTC attack. While flight attendants Sandra Bradshaw and CeeCee Lyles unsuccessfully attempt to revive Rothenberg, Bradshaw sees the hijackers moving the bodies of the pilots and Welsh and the passengers overhear this.\nAfter Flight 77 crashes into The Pentagon, FAA National Operations Manager Ben Sliney decides to shut down all United States air space and ground all flights. Passengers on United 93 learn of the other attacks from family members via airphone. Realising the hijackers have no intention of landing, Burnett, Bingham, Beamer, Glick (a former judo champion), Guadagno and Nacke form a plan to retake the plane, with assistance from flight staff, arming themselves with weapons, and learn passenger Donald Greene is a licensed pilot and passenger Andrew Garcia is a former air traffic controller. As the group gather, Haznawi and Nami anxiously realise they are losing control and Jarrah and Ghamdi become agitated, as they are twenty minutes away from D.C. and are unable to speed up to reach their target. Passenger Christian Adams, attempting to counsel appeasement, is restrained by some of the passengers, while other passengers pray and make final calls to loved ones.\nAfter Beamer urges the group to take action, the passengers charge a stunned Haznawi, tackle him and beat him. As Nami, Ghamdi and Jarrah panic, Bingham defeats Haznawi by bashing his skull in with a fire extinguisher and Nacke declares the bomb a fake. As Grandcolas, passengers William Cashman, Patrick Driscoll and Alan Beaven join the assault, Jarrah violently rocks the plane to disrupt the assault and Nami tries to hold them off with a serving cart, Mace and his own fire extinguisher. He too is subdued, and Glick gouges his eyes out before snapping his neck. As the group move Greene and Garcia though first-class, the passengers reach the cockpit door. Jarrah and Ghamdi are disheartened by the realisation that they will never reach their target, and debate on whether to crash the plane rather than cede control. The passengers breach the cockpit with the cart just as Jarrah puts the plane into a steep dive, reciting the takbir. Ghamdi tries to protect Jarrah, but the passengers overpower him and wrestle Jarrah for control. The aircraft inverts and crashes into a Shanksville field, killing everyone aboard.\n",

        "paragraph": "The 39th District Corruption Scandal refers to a persistent pattern of brutality and corruption among a cadre of Philadelphia Police Department officers, primarily from the Department's 39th District. The scandal emerged in late 1995 and received nationwide attention by 1997, eventually resulting in an investigation by Human Rights Watch. Hundreds of people were involved in the incidents that occurred in North Philadelphia in the early 1990s.  Some individuals are notable due to their direct participation, and others for their participation in related events, particularly the legal proceedings of the conviction of Mumia Abu-Jamal for the murder of Officer Daniel Faulkner.\nAccording to the Washington Post, police brutality within the district was \"particularly present under the leadership of Frank Rizzo\", and the district had \"a long history of periodic scandals and corruption cases, as well as a reputation for police brutality.\"[1] The core of the scandal involved actions by a group of Philadelphia police officers, some of whom were known to North Philadelphia as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. These officers were charged with investigating suspected crack houses and drug distribution hubs.  The officers conducted \"raids\" which were often unreported. In some of these locations the officers were also known for stealing from suspects and were described by one of the prosecuting judges as \"squash[ing] the Bill of Rights into the mud.\".[2]\nThree of the involved officers were dismissed from the department in 1991 for searching a known drug dealer's suburban apartment without a warrant. This dismissal was based on information provided by Pamela Jenkins, a prostitute and drug user who was the longtime girlfriend and informant of Officer Thomas Ryan. One of the dismissed officers, Sergeant Thomas Degovanni, was reinstated a year later, while another officer, John Baird, was in arbitration for reinstatement. The third dismissed officer, Thomas Ryan, was awarded a full disability pension by the city board of pensions.\nThe investigation into the illegal search was ultimately turned over to the FBI by the Philadelphia Police Department Internal Affairs Bureau at the direction of Police Commissioner Willie Williams, in the wake of the beating of Rodney King by the Los Angeles Police Department. Many high-ranking command officers saw this as a political move on the part of Commissioner Williams, who then actively campaigned for the position of Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.[citation needed]\nThe FBI carried the investigation as a low priority, assigning it to a rookie agent, James Williamson, as the first criminal investigation he headed. Williamson's investigation was stalled with no reliable witnesses or evidence to indict the 39th District, 5 Squad officers until Philadelphia Police Detective, James Dambach, was detailed to the FBI to assist Agent Williamson. By the summer of 1994 they had acquired enough circumstantial evidence of civil rights violations to approach former officer Thomas Ryan.\nRyan agreed to cooperate and turned over his informant and lover Pamela Jenkins to Detective Dambach and Agent Williamson. Ryan and Jenkins both agreed to wear body wires and to record their conversations with former officer Baird. In December 1994, Detective Dambach and Agent Williamson confronted Baird with the recordings made by Ryan and Jenkins. Baird, facing a long prison sentence if convicted, agreed to cooperate but was eventually charged and pled guilty to obstruction of justice for lying to a federal agent in a failed attempt to steer the investigation away from specific police officers who the Feds had targeted for indictment.\nThe federal investigation of the Philadelphia Police eventually expanded into the elite Highway Patrol Unit when Officer James Ryan (unrelated to Thomas Ryan) agreed to cooperate against the officers in that unit who engaged in the same activities as the officers in the 39th District.\nIn the wake of the scandal, nearly 1,400 cases were put under review; by 1997, between 160 and 300 had been overturned, leading to the release of more than 100 persons.  Beyond the convictions obtained by federal prosecutors, no one in the Philadelphia Police Detective was explicitly punished, other than being transferred to other units within the department, with the exception of Philadelphia Police Detective James Dambach, who upon returning to regular police duties found himself to be a pariah within the ranks. Labelled a \"Gink\" (Philadelphia police term for rat), Dambach endured the label and eventually attained the rank of lieutenant.\nThe following members of the Philadelphia Police Detective's Special Narcotics Unit, also known as The Five Squad, were convicted:\n",

        "paragraph": "On April 16, 2017, 74-year-old Robert Lee Godwin Sr. (September 7, 1942 \u2013 April 16, 2017)[1] was shot and killed with a firearm while walking in the Glenville neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The perpetrator, identified as 37-year-old Steve Stephens, posted a cellphone video of the shooting on his Facebook account, leading many media outlets, both during the manhunt and afterward, to dub Stephens the \"Facebook killer\".[2][3][4] A warrant was issued for Stephens for aggravated murder. Two days later, he died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound when cornered by police in Erie County, Pennsylvania.[4]\nThe shooting happened at around 2:00\u00a0p.m. EDT on April 16, 2017 (Easter Sunday), in the 600 block of East 93rd Street in Cleveland's Glenville neighborhood. Godwin, while walking around the streets, was carrying a bag to collect littered cans. Stephens uploaded a video of the event.[5][6] Seconds before the shooting, Stephens exited his car, approached the victim and then asked Godwin to, \"Say Joy Lane\", the name of a woman with whom Stephens had been in a romantic relationship. Stephens then said \"She's the reason why this is about to happen to you\", before fatally shooting Godwin, who fell to the ground after he was shot.[7] Facebook said the video was uploaded to the website after the fact, not livestreamed as initially reported.[8] In other Facebook posts, Stephens claimed responsibility for 13 murders, but police said they were not aware of any other victims.[6]\nA search for Stephens began soon after the shooting, prompting lockdowns at a number of locations, including Cleveland State University.[9] Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told reporters that detectives talked with Stephens by cellphone shortly after the shooting, but had no further contact with him since that time.[10]  The manhunt expanded to other states on the morning of April 17. Residents in Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, and Michigan were asked to be on alert,[11] and a US$50,000 reward was offered for information leading to Stephens' arrest on a charge of aggravated murder.[12][13] The FBI also aided the Cleveland Police Department.[14][15]\nAt 11:10\u00a0a.m. on  April 18, Stephens pulled into the drive-through lane of a McDonald's restaurant in Harborcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania, 100 miles (160\u00a0km) from the location of the shooting. An employee recognized Stephens from news reports and, after verifying with fellow employees, provided Stephens with part of his order, but stalled him by stating that his fries were still cooking. During this time police were called to the restaurant. Stephens, wary, left without his fries.[16]\nAs Stephens pulled out of the restaurant, state police gave chase heading westbound through Wesleyville, Pennsylvania. Stephens made it to the corner of Buffalo Road and Downing Avenue in the city of Erie, where Pennsylvania State Police successfully executed a tactical maneuver to bring the car to a stop. As police approached Stephens' car, he shot himself in the head, killing him instantly.[17][18]\nSteve William Stephens (December 10, 1979 \u2013 April 18, 2017) worked as a vocational specialist at Beech Brook, a behavioral health agency for children and families. He was wearing his work ID badge and repeatedly mentioned Beech Brook in multiple videos on the day of the murder.[22] Police confirmed there was no known connection between Godwin and Stephens prior to the shooting and that Godwin was selected at random.  Stephens' mother was quoted as having told authorities that Stephens told her by phone he was \"shooting people\" because he was \"mad with his girlfriend\" of about three years, who was confirmed to be safe and was cooperating with investigators at the time.[18]\nThe graphic video of Godwin's killing remained accessible to the public on Stephens' Facebook page for more than two hours on April 16 before it was removed by Facebook, according to a timeline shared by the company. The delay generated renewed criticism of Facebook over its handling of offensive content and, in particular, public posts of video and other content related to violent crimes.[23][24] \"We have a lot of work [to do], and we will keep doing all we can to prevent tragedies like this from happening\", Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his April 18 keynote address at F8, Facebook's annual developers' conference. \"Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Robert Godwin Sr.,\" Zuckerberg added.[25]\nOn May 3, 2017, Facebook announced that it was adding additional personnel to its \"global community operations\" team to proactively screen Facebook Live content for violent and other inappropriate content.  The new reviewers \"will also help us get better at removing things we don't allow on Facebook like hate speech and child exploitation\", Zuckerberg said.[26]\nOn September 2, 2017, a section of East 146th Street in Cleveland (where Godwin lived most of his adult life) was renamed \"Robert Godwin Sr. Way\" as a posthumous honor of his life and legacy in the neighborhood.[27]\n",

He left his family in 2000 to complete the Hajj, but later went to Afghanistan bound for an al-Qaeda training camp where he befriended other future hijackers and would soon be chosen to participate in the attacks.\nHe arrived in the United States in May 2001, on a tourist visa, where he would settle in Florida up until the attacks. On September 11, 2001, al-Nami boarded United 93 and assisted in the hijacking of the plane so that it could be flown into the U.S. Capitol. The plane instead crashed into a field in rural Somerset County, Pennsylvania during a passenger uprising, due to the passengers receiving information from their families of the three other hijacked planes that hit the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\nAl-Nami, much like Wail al-Shehri, Waleed al-Shehri and Mohand al-Shehri, was born in the 'Asir Province in Saudi Arabia.  Born to the Quraysh tribe of Saudi Arabia,[1] Al-Nami served as a muezzin at the Seqeley mosque after having reportedly become very religious sometime in early 1999. That autumn he left his family home in Abha in the summer of 2000 to complete the Hajj, but never returned \u2013 instead travelling to the Al Farouq training camp in Afghanistan where he met and befriended Waleed and Wail al-Shehri, two brothers from Khamis Mushayt in the same province, and Saeed al-Ghamdi. The four reportedly pledged themselves to Jihad in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail al-Shehri \u2013 who had dubbed himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions.[2] Dubbed \"Abu Hashim\", al-Nami was considered \"gentle in manner\" by his colleagues, and reported that he had a dream in which he rode a mare along with Muhammad, and that the prophet told him to dismount and fight his enemies to liberate his land.[1]\nDuring his time at al-Farooq, there is a curious mention under Mushabib al-Hamlan's details that al-Nami had recently had laser eye surgery, an uncited fact that does not reappear.\nBy October he had taken a prospective hijacker Mushabib al-Hamlan from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia where they both procured B-1/B-2 tourist/business visas on October 28 \u2013 but al-Hamlan then decided not to proceed and is thought to have returned to his family. Al-Nami's visa application has since been reviewed, and while he mentioned that al-Hamlan will be travelling with him, he listed his occupation as student but failed to provide an address for his school, and listed his intended address in the United States merely as Los Angeles \u2013 in the end he never used this visa to enter the United States, and reported his passport (C115007, which showed evidence of travel to Afghanistan) as \"lost\", and procured a new one from Jeddah (C505363).  He used the new passport to acquire a new B-1/B-2 visa in Jeddah on April 23, again recopying his answers from previously although crossing out the lines regarding al-Hamlan and previous attempts to acquire a visa.[3] He was interviewed by a consular officer, who again approved his application.  Records at the time only recorded past failures to procure a visa, so the officer had no way of realising that Nami had successfully received an earlier visa.\nIn mid-November 2000, the 9/11 Commission believes that al-Nami, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri, all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get \"clean\" passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.[4]\nWhile in the United Arab Emirates, al-Nami purchased traveler's cheques presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa al-Hawsawi.  Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Wail al-Shehri.\nIn March 2001, Ahmed al-Nami appeared in an al-Qaeda farewell video showing 13 of the \"muscle hijackers\" before they left their training centre in Kandahar; while he does not speak, he is seen studying maps and flight manuals.\nOn April 23, al-Nami was recorded obtaining a new US visa.[5]\n",

The demonstrations focused on ending the de facto segregation that resulted in the racial categorization of Chester public schools, even after the landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. The Board of Education of Topeka (1954).[1]  The racial unrest and civil rights protests were led by Stanley Branche of the Committee for Freedom Now (CFFN) and George Raymond of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons (NAACP).\nIn April 1964, a series of almost nightly protests brought chaos to Chester.  The city deputized firemen and trash collectors to help handle demonstrators[2] and the State of Pennsylvania deployed 50 state troopers to assist the 77-member Chester police force.[3] The demonstrations were marked by violence and police brutality which led to Chester being dubbed the \"Birmingham of the North\" by James Farmer.  Over 600 people were arrested over a two-month period of civil rights rallies, marches, pickets, boycotts and sit-ins.[4] National civil rights leaders such as Dick Gregory, Gloria Richardson and Malcolm X came to Chester in support of the demonstrations.  Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton convinced protestors to obey a court-ordered moratorium on demonstrations by forming the Pennsylvania Human Relations Committee to hold hearings on school desegregation.[5]\nThe protests resulted in the Pennsylvania Human Relations Committee determination that the Chester School Board had violated the law and the Chester School District was ordered to desegregate the city's six predominantly African-American schools. The city appealed the ruling, which delayed implementation, however the schools were eventually desegregated.\nDuring the 1950s and 60s, most of Chester's labor force participated in low-paying service positions or industrial work while manufacturing jobs were declining.  White and educated residents of Chester fled to suburban Delaware County to pursue better employment prospects and housing as more black residents moved into Chester.  From 1950 and 1960 the white population decreased by 19% and the black population increased by 53%.  With the white exodus, residential segregation fortified. 80% of the black population resided in a cluster of census tracts in central Chester.  White families that remained in Chester retained a higher income than black families in the city, with the median income for white families $5,880 and the median income for black families $4,059.  Black families constituted 50% of the impoverished population in Chester while white families only constituted 25%.[6]\n",

His father, Brad Evans, was a National Review journalist and his mother, Paula, a painter. His younger sister is American actress Gretchen Egolf. His younger half-brother is American/British musician Siegfried Faith-Evans. As a Roman Catholic[citation needed], his godparents were Leo Brent Bozell II and Patricia Lee Buckley. His parents divorced in Egolf's childhood and he took the surname of his stepfather, Gary Egolf. It was life in Philadelphia, however, that inspired Egolf, along with summer visits to his father's new home in Indiana. He graduated from Hempfield High School in Landisville, Pennsylvania, in 1990. Egolf briefly attended Temple University, in Philadelphia.\nEgolf dropped out of Temple and joined a punk rock band \"Freak Thing\", later \"Kitschchao\". The band did release one 7\" single on Compulsiv Records, but after the band was dissolved Egolf wanted to focus on his writing and moved to Paris, which he said was the best place to write about Kentucky, where Lord of the Barnyard was to be set. For 18 months, he wrote during the day and subsidized his rent by playing guitar in Irish bars and on the Pont des Arts as a street musician.\nIn Paris, Egolf struck up an acquaintance with Marie Modiano. Her father Patrick Modiano, French author and screenwriter (Lacombe Lucien) and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, helped Egolf get his first novel published in France in 1998 by Gallimard after it had been rejected by more than 70 U.S. publishers. Lord of the Barnyard was subsequently published in the United Kingdom and the United States and received moderately favorable reviews \u2013 with a few raves worldwide. His second book, Skirt and the Fiddle, was published in 2002 to even better critical response; his third, Kornwolf, was published after his death. He had also been working on a screenplay for Lord of the Barnyard, left unfinished.\nOutside his writing, Egolf achieved some renown as a political activist. In July 2004, he and a group of friends, later known as the Smoketown Six, were arrested outside Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for stripping down to thong underwear and piling on top of one another alongside a road that was being traveled by US President George W. Bush to protest the Abu Ghraib prison-abuse scandal.\nOn May 7, 2005, shortly after completing the manuscript for Kornwolf, Egolf shot himself in his apartment in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.[2] He left behind a seven-year-old daughter born in France and a nine-month-old daughter born in the United States.[3][4]\n",

A white mob attacked and burned African American steelworker Zachariah Walker alive in retaliation for reportedly killing Edgar Rice, a white Worth Brothers Steel company police officer.[1]\nBetween 1900 and 1910, the town of Coatesville became home to increasing numbers of African Americans and foreign-born whites.[2] The European immigrants who settled in Coatesville were unable to live in residential areas inhabited by US-born whites, and begrudgingly resorted to living near the town's African American populations.[3] This institutionalized ethnic hierarchy turned the town into a highly suspicious and segregated community.[3]\nOn August 12, 1911, Zachariah Walker, an African American resident of Coatesville, fired his handgun near a small group of immigrant workers, with the intention to scare them. Walker was under the influence of alcohol at the time.[4] Edgar Rice, a Worth Brothers Steel police officer, confronted Walker and threatened to club him.[5] Walker responded by saying he would retaliate by killing him.[6] Both Walker and Rice drew guns; Walker was first to the trigger and shot Rice twice. The officer died quickly afterwards.[6][7]\nAfter witnesses reported Rice's murder, locals searched the nearby area for Walker.[1] A young farm boy discovered him hiding in a barn, and informed two search-party members.[8] Walker scared the men away with his gun before they could apprehend him.[8]\nThe next day, a group of firefighters spotted Walker concealed in a tree.[1] As the firefighters tried to apprehend Walker, he attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. Walker ended up in custody, where a district attorney and two police officers claimed that he confessed to the crime, saying, \"I killed him easy.\"[1]\nOn August 13, 1911, an angry mob of about two thousand Coatesville residents camped outside the Coatesville Hospital, where Walker was recovering.[9] Soon after they surrounded the hospital, the mob easily pushed aside Walker's police guard, and proceeded to drag Walker out of the hospital while he was still chained to his bed.[9] The mob killed Walker by throwing him onto a makeshift funeral pyre.[9]\nAfter Walker's brutal murder, most of his remains were scavenged by souvenir hunters. Several members of the mob gathered some of his charred remains in a small box and dropped them off at the local hospital. On the box, there was a note that read: \"Return to his friends.\"[10]\nNot long after the lynching, the Coatesville Record newspaper reported that a large crowd of townsfolk had eagerly watched Walker's burning; some even collected his charred bones after the fire died down.[9] The Record interviewed Edgar Rice's widow, who was very upset because she had not personally lit Walker's pyre.[9]\nOutside Coatesville, nearly every newspaper condemned Walker's lynching as an act of inhumanity.[9] Former President Theodore Roosevelt publicly condemned lynching in general.[11] The New York Evening Post proclaimed shock that such a brutal lynching could take place in a Northern state.[12] The Atlanta Journal noted the practice of lynching could no longer be seen as an exclusively Southern crime.[12] The Richmond Planet suggested that African Americans might arm themselves to prevent further lynchings.[13]\n",

The former hit the Pentagon, while the latter later crashed in a field in western Pennsylvania.\nOn September 11, 2001, O'Brien was flying a Minnesota Air National Guard C-130H (Hercules) cargo airplane using callsign GOFER06.  He and his crew were on a return journey to Minnesota after having delivered supplies in the Caribbean.  He took off from Andrews Air Force Base, just southeast of Washington, DC, at about 9:30 am (EDT), and headed \"north and west\".  \"[We] had a beautiful view of the Mall\", he remarked.\nO'Brien later stated, \"this airplane [was] up and to the left of us, at 10 o'clock.  He was descending to our altitude, four miles or so away. The plane came nearer until it pretty much filled our windscreen.  Then he made a pretty aggressive turn, so he was moving right in front of us, a mile and a half, two miles away.\"\nWashington Reagan National Airport air traffic control asked O'Brien to identify the aircraft.  He reported that the plane was either a 757 or 767 Boeing airliner, and that its silver fuselage meant it was probably an American Airlines jet.  Controllers asked (\"vectored\") O'Brien to follow the plane (later identified as the errant AA Flight 77) as it approached Washington DC from the west.  He attempted to, having difficulty picking it out in the East Coast haze.  O'Brien saw a fireball, and initially believed the aircraft had hit the ground, but then saw the west side of the Pentagon.   He reported to the control tower, \"Looks like that aircraft crashed into the Pentagon sir\" and afterwards remarked that it had hit the west side.\nThe Hercules resumed its scheduled flight path.  When crossing western Pennsylvania at about 10:00 am, local air traffic control asked them to try to spot another errant aircraft, Flight 93.  Black smoke was seen barreling from an open field on the left hand side of the Hercules.\nO'Brien's flight was 17 miles from the crash site.  His flight observed the smoke within 1 minute 37 seconds of the crash of Flight 93.\n",

Daugherty, who was mentally disabled, was tortured and murdered before being wrapped in Christmas decorations, put inside a garbage can, and dumped in the parking lot of Greensburg-Salem Middle School.\nAmber Meidinger met Melvin Knight at a homeless shelter in Washington in January 2010. They moved to several locations before settling in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where they met Jennifer Daugherty.[1] Knight met Ricky Smyrnes after meeting previously in jail.[2]\nMelvin L. Knight (born October 27, 1989)[3] was born to a drug-addicted father who was imprisoned during the early years of his life. He developed lifelong learning and social problems after he fell out of a moving vehicle and hit his head at age 5.[4]\nAngela Lynn Marinucci (born July 14, 1992),[3] according to testimony by her mother and half-sister, Marinucci suffered a head injury when she was hit by a truck in 2008, at the age of 15. The injury substantially altered her behavior and pushed her into a downward spiral that ended with Daugherty\u2019s death, according to the defense. Two mental experts testified that Marinucci as a child, suffered from depression and that she may have had drug and alcohol addictions as a teenager.[5]\nMeidinger told jurors, \"at some point, she [Daugherty] trusted me because she knew me from the West Place (a center for people with special needs).\" Meidinger testified she and her then-boyfriend and co-defendant Melvin Knight met Smyrnes on February 8, 2010, after she and Knight had been staying at a Greensburg-area hotel. Knight and Smyrnes knew each other after meeting in jail, and Meidinger was pregnant with Knight's child when all three met up. Smyrnes offered Meidinger and Knight to stay at his apartment at 428 N. Pennsylvania Avenue in Greensburg.[6]\nRicky Ven Edward Smyrnes (born March 6, 1986)[3] was born to a drug-addicted Philadelphia sex worker and a Pittsburgh gang member. He was moved into and out of foster homes as a child and was treated for mental health disorders as early as age 4. He suffered abuse and neglect until he was taken in by the Smyrnes family in North Huntingdon at age 10, according to testimony by forensic psychologist Alice Applegate.[7] His lawyer, Terri Fayes, told the jury that Smyrnes suffered sexual and physical abuse from his father and his uncle. She also explained how he had tried beer, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana by age 6, had been diagnosed with PTSD at age 8, and had undergone 103 therapy sessions by age 10. She added he was diagnosed as having as many as seven different personalities, and 15 total psychiatric issues. In 1997, he burglarized his neighbor's home and stole knives, guitars, coins, bullets, and cash. That same year, he sexually assaulted a woman in her basement.[8]\nAccording to a testimony by Meidinger, the group went through her purse and stole money, gift cards, and her cell phone. They poured liquids into her bag, hit her head with filled soda bottles, cut her hair, painted her face with nail polish, and dumped liquid and spices on her head. Meidinger said she and Angela Marinucci took turns violently hitting Daugherty with a metal towel rack and crutches. She also noted that Daugherty was stripped naked, gagged, and raped by Knight.[1] They also forced her to consume feces, urine, and detergent.[9][10] Meidinger also said Knight took Daugherty to the living room where Marinucci poured a bottle of water over Daugherty's head and Knight and Smyrnes dumped oatmeal and spices on her head. Daugherty said that her eyes were burning, and Smyrnes told her to take a shower because she smelled bad.[2]\nAccording to her relatives, Daugherty had the mental abilities of an adolescent, trusted everyone, and thought that the suspects were her \"friends.\"[11]\n",

The 1986 film At Close Range is based loosely on Johnston's gang.\nBruce Johnston was a son of Louise and James Johnston, Sr. Along with his brother James, Jr., he was raised by his grandmother Harriet Steffy and grandaunt Sarah Martin, and neither of the boys started associating with their father until a few years before Bruce began his criminal activities.\nHe founded and led the Johnston Gang, which had a wide network and operated primarily in Chester County, according to a 1980 Pennsylvania Crime Commission report. He and the Johnston Gang also committed crimes in Lancaster County on several occasions and even crossed the state lines that bordered Maryland and Delaware. They primarily engaged in theft, stealing items that ranged from antiques to drugs.\nIn each break-in or theft, gang members used their skills in picking locks, cracking safes, and disarming or averting security systems. They used walkie-talkies and police scanners. While doing a job in one part of the county, they would divert the state police by phoning a false report elsewhere.\nIn August 1971, the gang targeted the Dutch Wonderland castle on Lincoln Highway East. The police believe that the main culprits were David, Norman, and Bruce, Sr., and that they made away with $33,000 worth of cash and property.\nAncell E. Hamm, murdered two Kennett Square patrolmen. As a result, police began heavily investigating the gang's activities.\nThe gang broke into the shop at Meadia Heights Country Club in Lancaster, PA. They drilled holes in the side of the shop and disarmed the alarm system, and used dynamite to gain access to a safe. They made off with $15,000 in money and golf equipment, none of which was ever recovered.\nJanet Gazzerro and her husband Frank were convicted of bribing a juror who was on the Chester County Common Pleas Court where among others Bruce Johnston Sr. was accused of the theft of a tractor. Janet and Frank received $83,000 in stolen rugs, jewelry and furs. Janet testified that Bruce Sr. gave her two or three garden tractors, of which she kept one or two, and gave the third to the juror in question. Bruce Sr., David and Norman Johnston and Roy Myers were acquitted of the theft charges.\nWhen the police were gathering information about the burglary ring, Manheim resident Gary G. Hauck was asked to testify. Hauck had unknowingly bought a piece of farm equipment stolen by the Johnston gang in 1976. Police traced it back to the ring and wanted Hauck to testify who he had bought it from. Hauck, then a self-employed auto body worker, told a reporter he had gotten a call at 2:00 the morning before the preliminary hearing. The caller urged him not to identify anyone at the hearing. To convince Hauck that he wasn't fooling, the caller said Hauck would find dynamite under the seat of his truck, but that it wasn't hooked up. Hauck looked and found five sticks of dynamite, and did not identify at the hearing. Later, during a trial of the brothers, Hauck said he had lied at the hearing because of the threat.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nMumia Abu-Jamal (born Wesley Cook;[3] April 24, 1954) is an American political activist and journalist who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1982 for the 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. While on death row, he has written and commented on the criminal justice system in the United States. After numerous appeals, his death penalty sentence was overturned by a federal court. In 2011, the prosecution agreed to a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. He entered the general prison population early the following year.\nBeginning at the age of 14 in 1968, Abu-Jamal became involved with the Black Panther Party and was a member until October 1970, leaving the party at age 16. After leaving, he completed his high school education, and later became a radio reporter. He eventually served as president of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists (1978\u20131980). He supported the Philadelphia organization MOVE and covered the 1978 confrontation in which one police officer was killed. The MOVE Nine were the members who were arrested and convicted of murder in that case.\nSince 1982, the murder trial of Abu-Jamal has been seriously criticized for constitutional failings;[4] some have claimed that he is innocent, and many opposed his death sentence.[5][6] The Faulkner family, politicians,[7] and other groups involved with law enforcement, state and city governments[8] argue that Abu-Jamal's trial was fair, his guilt beyond question, and his death sentence justified. \nWhen his death sentence was overturned by a Federal court in 2001, he was described as \"perhaps the world's best-known death-row inmate\" by The New York Times.[9] During his imprisonment, Abu-Jamal has published books and commentaries on social and political issues; his first book was Live from Death Row (1995).\nAbu-Jamal was born Wesley Cook in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he grew up. He has a younger brother named William. They attended local public schools.\nIn 1968, a high school teacher, a Kenyan instructing a class on African cultures, encouraged the students to take African or Arabic names for classroom use; he gave Cook the name \"Mumia\".[10] According to Abu-Jamal, \"Mumia\" means \"Prince\" and was the name of a Kenyan anti-colonial African nationalist who fought against the British before Kenyan independence.[11]\nAbu-Jamal has described being \"kicked\u00a0... into the Black Panther Party\" as a teenager of 14, after suffering a beating from \"white racists\" and a policeman for trying to disrupt a 1968 rally for Independent candidate George Wallace, former governor of Alabama, who was running on a racist platform.[12][13] From then he helped form the Philadelphia branch of the Black Panther Party with Defense Captain Reggie Schell,[14][15] and other Panthers. He was appointed as the chapter's \"Lieutenant of Information,\" responsible for writing information and news communications. In an interview in the early years, Abu-Jamal quoted Mao Zedong, saying that \"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun\".[16] That same year, he dropped out of Benjamin Franklin High School and began living at the branch's headquarters.[15]\nHe spent late 1969 in New York City and early 1970 in Oakland, living and working with BPP colleagues in those cities; the party had been founded in Oakland.[17] He was a party member from May 1969 until October 1970. During this period, he was subject to illegal surveillance as part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's COINTELPRO program, with which the Philadelphia police cooperated. The FBI was working to infiltrate black radical groups and to disrupt them by creating internal dissension.\n",

        "paragraph": "The \"kids for cash\" scandal centered on judicial kickbacks to two judges at the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, US.[1] In 2008, judges Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella were convicted of accepting money in return for imposing harsh adjudications on juveniles to increase occupancy at the PA Child Care for-profit detention centers.[2]\nCiavarella disposed thousands of children to extended stays in youth centers for offenses as trivial as mocking an assistant principal on Myspace or trespassing in a vacant building.[3] After a judge rejected an initial plea agreement in 2009,[4][5] a federal grand jury returned a 48-count indictment.[6] In 2010, Conahan pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and was sentenced to 17.5 years in federal prison.[7] Ciavarella opted to go to trial the following year. He was convicted on 12 of 39 counts and sentenced to 28 years in federal prison.[8]\nIn the wake of the scandal, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overturned hundreds of adjudications of delinquency in Luzerne County.[9] The Juvenile Law Center filed a class action lawsuit against the judges and numerous other parties,[10] and the Pennsylvania state legislature created a commission to investigate juvenile justice problems in the county.[11]\nPennsylvania's Judicial Conduct Board received four complaints about Michael Conahan between 2004 and 2008, but later admitted it failed to investigate any of them, nor had it sought documentation regarding the cases involved.[12] The FBI was tipped off about Conahan and nepotism in the county courts in 2006.[13] An additional investigation into improper sentencing in Luzerne County began in early 2007 as a result of requests for assistance from several youths received by the Philadelphia-based Juvenile Law Center. Attorneys from the Center determined that several hundred cases were tried without the defendants receiving proper counsel. In April 2008, the Center petitioned the Pennsylvania Supreme Court seeking relief for alleged violation of the youths' civil rights. The application of relief was later denied, then reconsidered in January 2009 when corruption charges against both Conahan and Mark Ciavarella surfaced.[14]\nThe FBI and the IRS also investigated Conahan and Ciavarella, although the exact dates and scope of these federal investigations were not made public.[15] Part of the investigation was revealed to have occurred during disciplinary hearings over the conduct of another former Luzerne County judge, Ann H. Lokuta.[16] Lokuta was brought before the Judicial Conduct Board in November 2006 to answer charges of using court workers to do her personal bidding, openly displaying bias against some attorneys arguing before her, and publicly berating staff to cause mental distress.[17] The board ruled against Lokuta in November 2008, and she was removed from the bench. During the course of the hearings, Lokuta charged that Conahan was behind a conspiracy to have her removed.[18] She aided the federal investigation into the \"kids for cash\" scheme prior to the Conduct Board's ruling, and a stay order was issued in March 2009 by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in light of the ongoing investigations, halting Lokuta's removal and the special election that was to be held to replace her.[19] During the Lokuta hearing, Conahan testified that there were no social relationships amongst the county judges. However, Judge Michael T. Toole (who pleaded guilty to and was convicted in April 2011 of Fraud and Tax Evasion charges[20]) as well as another judge, had each stayed at a Florida condo jointly owned by Conahan and Ciavarella.[13]\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided to uphold Lokuta's removal from the bench in January 2011, finding she had received a fair trial, regardless of Conahan's testimony. It also ordered the expungements of the records of 2,401 of those juveniles who were affected.[21][22]\nA statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania outlined the charges against the two judges on January 26, 2009. The charges outlined in the information[23] described actions between 2000 and 2007 by both judges to assist in the construction and population of private juvenile facilities operated by the two Pennsylvania Child Care companies, acting in an official capacity in favor of the private facilities over the facility operated by Luzerne County.[15]\nThe U.S. Attorney charged that in 2002 Conahan, who at the time was President Judge of the court, used his authority to remove funding for the county-operated facility. The judges were alleged to have received \"millions of dollars\" in payments for the completion of a binding agreement between the court and the private facilities, co-owned by attorney Robert Powell, to use their services and the subsequent closing of the county facility.[4] The methods used to conceal the payments involved several parties and transactions which resulted in allegations of tax evasion against the two. Ciavarella and Conahan were also charged with \"Ordering juveniles to be sent to these facilities in which the judges had a financial interest even when Juvenile Probation Officers did not recommend placement,\" according to the statement.[4]\nOriginal, negotiated plea agreements called for both judges to serve up to seven years in prison, pay fines and restitution, and accept responsibility for the crimes.[1] However, on July 30, 2009, Judge Edwin M. Kosik of Federal District Court in nearby Scranton rejected the plea agreement, citing \"post-guilty plea conduct and expressions from the defendants\" that he ruled did not satisfy the terms of the agreement. Kosik wrote that Conahan and Ciavarella continued to deny their crimes even in the face of overwhelming evidence, and therefore did not merit sentences that were well below federal sentencing guidelines.[24][5] Attorneys for the two judges brought a motion requesting reconsideration of the judge's rejection of the plea agreement.[25] The motion was denied on August 24, 2009, and Ciavarella and Conahan subsequently withdrew their guilty pleas, an action which eventually resulted in a jury trial for Ciavarella and additional charges against the former judges.[26]\n",

He played two seasons each with the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cincinnati Reds, and was the starter at third base for the Pittsburgh Pirates during his final season in the major leagues. He was officially listed as standing 5\u00a0feet 11\u00a0inches (180\u00a0cm) and weighing 175 pounds (79\u00a0kg).[1]\nWilliam Gray was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 5, 1871.[2]\nGray began his career at age 19 as a utility player for the Philadelphia Phillies of the National League. He appeared in 34 games in 1890\u2014his first season with the team\u2014amassing a .242 batting average in his debut season,[3] the same as his career average.[4] During the year, he scored 20 runs and batted in 21. At the plate, he hit eight doubles and four triples, and stole five bases during the year.[3] In the field, Gray appeared at seven positions on the diamond (all but pitcher and shortstop) in his first year, making ten appearances in the outfield (six games in left, three in center, and one in right), eight each at second base and third base, seven behind the plate at catcher, and one at first base.[5]\nGray's batting declined during the 1891 season, as he amassed no extra-base hits and his batting average dropped to .240. He scored eleven runs, batted in seven, and stole three bases; he also walked three times.[6] His 81 plate appearances, 73 times at bat, and 23 games played were all second-best among Philadelphia's bench (Ed Mayer).[6] Defensively, he appeared in games at five positions; catcher was his most utilized role, as it was the only position that he played in more than ten games. He made nine errors behind the plate and caught 26% of potential baserunners stealing.[5]\nDuring the 1892 season, Gray played in the minor leagues for the Providence Grays and the Philadelphia Athletics of the Eastern League, which at that time represented the top level (A) of minor league play. He played for the Grays from April 30 through June 18,[7] and then with the Athletics (alongside Matt Kilroy and Jim Devlin) from June 20 to the conclusion of the season on September 12.[8] Between the two teams, Gray collected 15 doubles, 3 triples, and 1 home run, the first of his minor league career. He batted .251 and slugged .336 while stealing 16 bases and scoring 45 runs.[9]\nGray played with the Indianapolis Hoosiers in 1894, but no information about that year's team is available other than their roster.[10]\nIn 1895, Gray returned to the National League with the Cincinnati Reds, appearing in 43 games as an infielder\u2014adding 5 games at shortstop to his repertoire of positions\u20145 games as a catcher, and 1 game in left field.[5] He led Cincinnati's bench players in doubles (17) and runs batted in (29), while placing second with 4 triples and 15 walks.[11] He batted .304, the highest average of his professional career, and hit his only home run in the majors during that season as well.[5]\nThe 1896 season was less productive for Gray, as he batted only .207 in 46 games and ranking last among Cincinnati's bench players in batting average, hits, doubles, and runs scored.[12] It was also the only year of Gray's career in which he appeared at all four infield positions; in total, he played 37 games in the field at 7 different positions. Most of his games were played at second base (12 games, 6 errors in 82 chances) and catcher (11 games, 3 errors in 38 chances, 43% of baserunners caught stealing).[5]\nIn 1897, Gray played a second stint with the Hoosiers, now known as the \"Indians\", of the Western League. It was his most productive season as a player; at age 26, he played in 125 games for the Hoosiers, batting .347, the fifth-highest average on the team. He hit 19 home runs to lead the Hoosiers, adding 26 doubles, 11 triples, and 13 stolen bases. He also led Indianapolis with 21 sacrifice hits.[13] After the season, he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates with four other players in a deal that included Pink Hawley.[2]\n",

        "paragraph": "Maddox Lamar Derkosh was a two-year-old American boy killed in an animal attack after falling into an African wild dog exhibit at The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium on November 4, 2012.[1] The exhibit featured a special observation deck for viewing the dogs; Derkosh's mother, Elizabeth Derkosh, lifted her son up onto the railing of the exhibit for \"a better view\" despite numerous warning signs posted and barriers established. Maddox Derkosh slipped, falling 14 feet (4.3\u00a0m) from the railing, past a catch-all safety net built for collecting falling debris, and into the painted dog enclosure, where he was immediately mauled by 11 of the painted dogs.[2] One of the dogs was shot and killed by a police officer on the scene, while zoo staff tried to detain the remaining dogs. Maddox Derkosh was rapidly torn apart and eviscerated by the dogs, and bled to death before anybody was able to reach him. Elizabeth Derkosh was initially accused of criminal negligence in a court filing, but was never prosecuted, having filed her own lawsuit against the zoo and later settling out of court.[3][4]\nThe zoo's African painted dog exhibit consisted of a large number of the dogs kept within an enclosure, near which was a solid structure made mostly of wood material with a viewing deck allowing visitors to watch the dogs from above. Below the deck was a catch-all safety net intended to gather any falling debris so that nothing would accidentally end up in the enclosure. The exhibit featured a number of warning signs urging visitors to be careful when using the deck, while staff of the zoo claimed that visitors were briefed on the dangers of wild animals. In a report for ABC News, Jack Hanna argued that African painted dogs are a very aggressive species, as he had worked around them in the 1990s during the filming of his series Jack Hanna's Wild Countdown. Hanna stated in the interview, \"I don't care if a zookeeper, a policeman, a tranquilizer gun, whatever would have been right there, could not have helped. Sorry is not a word that... that I can even say... condolences? I don't know what word to use, but my heart aches right now for everybody.\"[5] The zoo had never had any visitor death on record until the incident with Maddox Derkosh occurred.[6]\nIn November 2012, Maddox Derkosh had been with his family at The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium for a day trip. Parents Jason and Elizabeth Derkosh were both in attendance. It was, according to zoo staffer Lou Nene, not an uncommon occurrence to see parents hoisting their kids up onto the railing of the exhibit for a clearer view of the painted dogs, despite the numerous warnings they would be given about the behaviour. The catch-all safety net below was only intended to rescue small objects like cell phones, cameras and sunglasses dropped by visitors, and was not sufficient to catch the weight of a human being.[7][8]\nElizabeth Derkosh wandered past the warning signs with Maddox and lifted the boy up atop the railing of the viewing deck for a better look at the dogs, when Maddox slipped from her grasp, bouncing off the safety net and onto the ground of the enclosure several feet below. The dog pack proceeded to attack Maddox, while Elizabeth screamed and tried to break into the enclosure to rescue her son, during which she was restrained by another visitor. Other visitors in attendance claimed to hear Elizabeth screaming for help from the distance, while other visitors closer to the exhibit were able to see the dogs attacking Maddox. In order to get one of the dogs away from Maddox, the dog was shot and killed by a police officer at the scene; none of the other dogs were harmed during the incident.[9][10]\nIt was initially unclear in most news coverage of the case whether Maddox had been killed by the lengthy fall to the ground, or by the dogs themselves. Eventually it was revealed that Maddox had still been fully conscious after the fall, and that the dogs had torn his body apart while mauling and biting him, after which the boy was finally approached when it was safe to attempt a rescue. Maddox's internal organs had been destroyed by the dogs tearing at them, and he had suffered more than 46 wounds to his head and neck.[11] By the time veterinarian Barbara Baker and other zoo staff arrived on the scene, they determined it would be futile to try and rescue Maddox. According to Baker, \"it was clear the child was dead. There was no reason to send our staff into harm\u2019s way.\" Maddox bled to death, and his body was eventually recovered and sent to a medical examiner for investigation after the remaining painted dogs were detained.[12][13]\nMaddox's killing triggered a lengthy debate between the Derkosh family and The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium, which escalated into lawsuits and court filings. The zoo argued that it was not at fault for the attack on Maddox, and moreover, that Elizabeth was reckless and negligent in deliberately lifting her son up atop the railing when she had explicitly been told not to. Elizabeth, in turn, argued that the zoo was irresponsible in the design and operation of the enclosure and viewing deck; her lawsuit, which sought damages of US$300,000, brought to light that there was only an \"ill-fitting window\" to prevent visitors from getting too close to the railing, and that the painted dogs were roaming loose. There had, it was later revealed, also been a previous case where the zoo had to be temporarily put in lockdown because of the dogs escaping their enclosure and wandering around the greater zoo property, although nobody had been injured or killed by them.[14]\nIn response to the allegations made by Lou Nene, which became integral to Elizabeth's lawsuit, the zoo denied claims that officials had received any warning from staff that parents regularly lifted their children onto the unprotected area overlooking the wild dogs exhibit and did nothing to protect them. The zoo also claimed that the railing surrounding the enclosure complied with building and safety codes, and denied claims that it lacked an emergency plan at the time of the incident.[15] The zoo removed the observation deck a month after the mauling. The exhibit displaying the wild dogs, which are an endangered species and native to sub-Saharan Africa, was shuttered shortly after. It was later replaced with a cheetah exhibit. \"The USDA has conducted 35 inspections at the painted dog exhibit since its opening in 2006. At no time have any concerns or violations regarding this exhibit been identified by the regulatory agency,\" said Public and Media Relations Manager Tracy Gray in defence of the zoo.[16]\nElizabeth Derkosh was not charged with negligence despite the accusations made against her. The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium received some public and media backlash for its treatment towards the grieving mother; Robert Mongeluzzi, a lawyer for the Derkosh family, said in a statement that \"the zoo's position is dead wrong and shameful\", while Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A Zappala, Jr. declared Maddox Derkosh's killing a \"tragic accident\" while adding that Elizabeth would not face any charges despite the zoo's claims. The Derkosh family and The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.[17]\nAfrican painted dogs are an endangered species and the act of killing 1 out of the 11 dogs attacking Maddox had been an emergency measure to try and get to Maddox's body and attempt a rescue. The other dogs were not killed or harmed, but instead relocated to various undisclosed locations. \"We want our visitors to enjoy a family fun and safe environment while learning about our animals. Unfortunately, the painted dogs would have been a continuous reminder of the accident and would distract from educational opportunities to learn about this wonderful and endangered species,\" stated The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium.[18]\n",

The precise inclusion criteria are disputed, and there is no broadly accepted definition.[2][3]\nGun Violence Archive, a nonprofit research group that tracks shootings and their characteristics in the United States, defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people, excluding the perpetrator(s), are shot in one location at roughly the same time.[4] The Congressional Research Service narrows that definition to four or more killed and excludes the injured who survive.[5][6] The Washington Post and Mother Jones use similar definitions, with the latter acknowledging that their definition \"is a conservative measure of the problem\", as many shootings with fewer fatalities occur.[7][8] The crowdsourced Mass Shooting Tracker project applies the most expansive definition: four or more shot in any incident, including the perpetrator.[9][10]\nA 2019 study of mass shootings published in the journal Injury Epidemiology recommended developing \"a standard definition that considers both fatalities and nonfatalities to most appropriately convey the burden of mass shootings on gun violence.\"[11] The authors of the study further suggested that \"the definition of mass shooting should be four or more people, excluding the shooter, who are shot in a single event regardless of the motive, setting or number of deaths.\"[12]\nOnly incidents considered mass shootings by at least two of the above sources are listed below.

        "paragraph": "The Coal miners' strike of 1873, was a strike against wage cuts in the Mahoning, Shenango, and Tuscarawas Valleys of northeastern Ohio and northwestern Pennsylvania.[1] In the Tuscarawas Valley, the labor action lasted six months, and in the Mahoning Valley four and a half months,[2] but the walkouts failed. The introduction of imported strikebreakers and manufacturers finding substitutes for the area's special block-coal, forced the organized miners back to work at prevailing wages.[3]\nAs of 1872, bituminous coal miners in this location received $1.10 per ton of coal mined. Later that year, they demanded a $0.15 per ton increase. The mine operators responded with a demand for a decrease of $0.20 per ton. By January 1, 1873, over 6,000 unionized coal miners had walked out over the proposed 25% wage cut.[4] The local and national press followed the events of the miners' walkout. They covered several violent confrontations between striking miners and replacement workers.\nThe events around this local miners' action proved to be precedent setting in several ways. Mine owners employed the practice of importing replacement workers (strikebreakers) from far afield, from the Port of New York and other Eastern seaports, and from Virginia.[5]  As of February 6, with 7,500 strikers out, owners had imported the first 300 black replacements from Virginia, \"and the experiment succeeds so well that other proprietors will probably follow suit.\"[6]\nThe Unification of Italy produced a new country, the Kingdom of Italy. The fledging government\u2019s policies of raising taxes and converting communal and church lands into real estate hit the peasant population particularly hard. To add to the troubles, a bandits\u2019 war against the Kingdom threw the Southern countryside into chaos. The result caused thousands of Italians to leave for Northern Europe and the Americas. Previous Italian immigration to the U.S. had been negligible, but by 1870, immigrants arriving on the East Coast reached the thousands for the first time.[7] Unlike subsequent generations of Italian immigrants, these first arrivals had no contacts or job offers in the United States. The penniless immigrants ended up at government expense in a large shelter on Ward\u2019s Island, on the grounds of an insane asylum. Shipload after shipload of economic refugees from Italy continued to arrive, overcrowding the holding facility. When the coal operators from the Mahoning Valley sent recruiters to tap this idle labor force, 200 Italians responded to their call between March and May 1873. One group arrived in Coalburg, Hubbard Township, and the second, a few months later, in Church Hill, Liberty Township.[7] Newspaper accounts record that the replacement miners were sent by rail to work mines in Coalburg, Hubbard Township and Church Hill, Liberty Township, Ohio.[8][9]\nAt the outset of their rail journey, neither the Italians nor the Virginia men knew their employment was contingent upon being replacement workers.[10] Throughout the strike and even afterwards, considerable violence and destruction resulted from clashes between strikers and strikebreakers.[11] Strikers engaged in physical attacks against replacement miners and miners who returned to work in Coalburg and in several nearby townships. Local papers recorded arson and one strike-related homicide, that of Giovanni Chiesa, aka John Church, both in Churchill.[12]\nThe appearance of the Italian strikebreakers marks one of the earliest recorded arrivals of Southern Italians in the Mahoning Valley. After the conclusion of the strike, many settled in Coalburg's Little Italy.[13] The actions of the coal mine operators may have also added to the number of African Americans settling in the Mahoning Valley. The tactic of exploiting immigrants and blacks as strikebreakers continued for several decades.[14][15] This undermined coal miners' efforts to organize.  The strike marks post-Civil War changes in the relationship between capital and labor. Importation of replacements from afar to control the workplace now became possible via new technology, the telegraph and railroads.[16][17]\nAlthough the miners' strike began nine months before the Panic of 1873, railroad construction had begun falling the year before as a result of Civil War over expansion.[18] This had a deflationary effect on coal prices as the demand for iron and steel decreased. Strikes by the same coal workers continued at least through March 1876 in the Tuscarawas Valley, when a strike at the Warmington Mine south of Canton escalated into violence that required the insertion of state troops by Governor Rutherford B. Hayes to restore order.[19]  Young attorney William McKinley represented the unpopular miners without a fee, by highlighting the dangers of the industry \u2013 250 fatalities in the state every year, and another 700 injuries \u2013 and the practices of local mine owners.  One of those owners was Mark Hanna.  Although opponents in the case, the two formed a political alliance that saw McKinley elected U.S. president in 1896.[20]\n",

        "paragraph": "Antuan Bronshtein is a Russian immigrant to the United States, convicted murderer, and reputed associate of the Russian mafia.\nBronshtein, 19 years old at the time, was stopped near his apartment in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on February 22, 1991 while driving a stolen car. Police found a handgun in the car which ballistics tests linked to the murder of Jerome Slobodkin, a Philadelphia jeweler who had been shot to death on February 19, 1991. Bronshtein confessed to the killing, and told police that he had quarrelled with Slobodkin over the price of some stolen watches the jeweler had agreed to buy from Bronshtein.[1] At the time of Slobodkin's murder, Bronshtein was free on bail awaiting trial on burglary charges.[2]\nBronshtein was convicted on 27 February 1992 and sentenced to life in prison.[3]\nOn June 2, 1993, Bronshtein was arrested in the Pennsylvania Corrections Institute in Dallas, Pennsylvania, and charged with the 11 January 1991 murder of jewelry store owner Alexander Gutman.[4] Bronshtein was convicted of this crime in April 1994[5] and sentenced to death in August 1994.[6]\nAlthough newspaper coverage at the time of the killings and Bronshtein's trials did not make an explicit connection, both of these killings were later linked to Russian Mafia activity.[7]\nOn July 16, 1997, then governor Tom Ridge signed a death warrant for Bronshtein, authorizing his execution by lethal injection.[8] The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania issued a stay on 28 July 1997[9] to allow Bronshtein to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which denied certiorari without comment on 20 October 1997.[10] Bronshtein's execution was rescheduled for 10 December 1997,[11] and stayed on 3 December 1997, at which point Bronshtein was being held in the supermax Pennsylvania Greene prison.[12]\nOn February 17, 1999 Ridge signed another death warrant for Bronshtein, who was now in the Rockview Pennsylvania State Prison, scheduling his execution for 8 April 1999.[13] Because the date set for Bronshtein's execution fell on the last day of passover, Ridge decided in March to reschedule it.[14] Bronshtein vowed to refuse further appeals, although he continued to maintain his innocence. According to his mother, Maria Pogrevebsky, \"He said that in a society of lies and injustice the truth must die. There is no justice in this society, he says.\" By this time, his case had been taken up by the Philadelphia-based Center for Legal Education, Advocacy & Defense Assistance, which claimed that Bronshtein was mentally ill, that his competence had never been assessed by a court, and that there had been errors in the jury instructions in one of Bronshtein's trials.[15]\nThe Center, acting on behalf of Bronshtein's mother and sister, appealed his execution, rescheduled for May 4, 1999, to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on the grounds that Bronshtein was not competent to refuse further appeals. On April 16, 1999, the court refused to stay the execution. The majority opinion was written by justice Sandra Schultz Newman, with justice John P. Flaherty, Jr. dissenting.[16] Bronshtein's final appeal on the state level, which was pending even as he pursued appeals on the federal level, was denied unanimously by the state supreme court in June 2000.[17]\nAlan Dershowitz joined with lawyers from the Center in appealing Bronshtein's case on the federal level. The case was brought to Dershowitz's attention by a rabbi from Pittsburgh, who sent him an article stating that Bronshtein had said that he might consider appealing if Dershowitz represented him. Dershowitz filed an affidavit with Bronshtein's appeal claiming that executing him without a proper psychiatric evaluation would be tantamount to assisting in the \"judicial suicide of this incompetent prisoner.\"[18] When Dershowitz agreed to help Bronshtein, Bronshtein agreed to appeal his sentence. At the end of April 1999 he requested and was consequently granted, unopposed by Montgomery County District Attorney Mary Killinger, a 120-day stay of execution.[19]\nOn 5 July 2001, United States district court judge Lowell A. Reed, Jr. ordered that Bronshtein be retried for the Gutman murder. Reed's decision stated that the trial judge's failure to inform the jury that Bronshtein was already serving a life sentence tainted the trial. If jurors had known this, Reed reasoned, they might not have imposed the death penalty.[20] Reed also found that Bronstein's trial was flawed in that the prosecutor had misled the jury about Bronshtein's future threat to society, and that the jury had not been instructed that a life sentence in Bronshtein's case would preclude parole.[21]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Philadelphia poison ring was a murder for hire gang led by Italian immigrant cousins, Herman and Paul Petrillo, in 1930s Philadelphia, where the Italian community had almost doubled in 20 years from 76,734 in 1910 (the year the Petrillos arrived in the country) to over 155,000 by 1930 - just before the murder ring began operations. The activities of the ring came to light in 1938 and the cousins were ultimately convicted of first degree murder and executed by electric chair in 1941.\nA Russian-Jewish immigrant gang member, Morris Bolber, known as 'Louie, the Rabbi', turned state's evidence. Gang members, associates and 'dupes' (many of them Italian-born, superstitious women, dubbed 'poison widows' by an excited press) were brought to trial and mostly convicted to death sentences (later commuted) or varying prison sentences. One or two were found not guilty, notably the widow Stella Alfonsi, whose husband's 1938 death by poison brought the case to light, and who was successfully defended by the lawyer Raymond Pace Alexander.\nHerman and Paul Petrillo were cousins. Herman was an expert counterfeiter and arsonist, with contacts in the criminal world, while Paul ran an insurance scam business from the back of his tailor's shop and aspired to a paid consultancy in 'la fattura', a magic believed in and resorted to by many in South Philadelphia's Italian community. The murders began in 1931, with Herman enlisting associate thugs to kill men he had arranged to insure, to collect on the double indemnity accident insurance.\nHerman ruthlessly and euphemistically described this as \"sending [them] to California\". Two victims, Ralph Caruso and Joseph Arena were both drowned and bludgeoned on separate fishing trips. While a third victim, John Woloshyn, was first bludgeoned and then repeatedly run over by a car. Meanwhile, Herman tried to steer clear of repeated attempts by the authorities to bring him to justice for insurance fraud, arson and currency counterfeiting.\nAs the Depression deepened, the Petrillos headed an informal gang, now including Morris Bolber and other self-styled 'fattuchierie' (wise women, witches) such as Maria Carina Favato, Josephine Sedita and Rose Carina, who offered superstitious, unhappily married, murderous or merely gullible women incantations, powders and potions to adjust their lives. These 'love potions' usually contained arsenic, or antimony, and they were invariably accompanied by excessive insurance policies on the victims, often made out in favour of gang members rather than the supposed 'poison widow' beneficiaries.\nThe gang embraced insurance agents and made highly successful use of the period's widespread cheap insurance policies, often taken out without medical examination (not required for policies under $500) or the knowledge of the principal concerned, who would subsequently meet an agonising death by arsenic, engineered by the spouse; possibly with intent, possibly in superstitious ignorance of their actions. This went on from 1932 until 1938, when the death of Ferdinando Alfonsi in a hospital brought matters into the open.\nVincent P. McDevitt was an Assistant District Attorney in Philadelphia. In early 1939, the District Attorney, Charles F. Kelley, assigned him to the homicide case of Ferdinando Alfonsi, who had died on 27 October 1938. McDevitt immediately had information from two undercover detectives, agents Landvoight and Phillips. From them, McDevitt had an informant, one George Meyer, who ran a local upholstery cleaning business.[1]\nMeyer encountered Herman Petrillo when he was trying to obtain money for his business. Petrillo had offered to provide him with a large sum of money in both legal tender and counterfeit, if Meyer would perform the hit on Alfonsi. Landvoight and Meyer had played along with the murder plot, with Meyer hoping for an advance pay-out and Landvoight hoping to finally bust Petrillo's counterfeiting crimes.[2] Working undercover, Landvoight helped Meyer \"play along,\" as the Petrillos plotted the murder that they wanted Meyer to carry out.\nThe plan was to steal or buy a car, take Alfonsi out to a dark country road and hit him with the car, thus making the murder look accidental.[3] Herman Petrillo preferred the idea to steal the car rather than buy one, but Landvoight and Phillips were hoping to convince Petrillo to give them money to buy a car for the murder, as it would give them the opportunity that Phillips had so long prayed for, to arrest him on counterfeit charges. In the end, Petrillo sold them some fake tender, ostensibly for buying a means of transportation to the planned crime scene.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "The 1982 Wilkes-Barre shootings was a spree killing in the United States carried out by George Emil Banks (born June 22, 1942). A former Camp Hill prison guard, Banks fatally shot 13 people on September 25, 1982, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and Jenkins Township.  The victims included seven children \u2013 five being his own \u2013 their mothers, some of their relatives, and one bystander.[1] It is the deadliest mass shooting in Pennsylvania's history.[2]\nHis attorneys argued for the insanity defense, but, following a trial before jurors from Allegheny County and presided over by Luzerne County Common Pleas judge Patrick J. Toole Jr., Banks was convicted of 12 counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.[3]\nOn November 29, 1990, the Pennsylvania State Legislature barred further use of the electric chair amid debate that electrocution was cruel and unusual punishment; it approved execution by lethal injection. Banks's case was appealed and, on December 2, 2004, he received a stay of execution following a determination that he was incompetent for execution. On May 12, 2010, Luzerne County Common Pleas judge Joseph Augello declared Banks incompetent to be executed, following a competency hearing held the previous month.[4]\nOn the night of September 24, 1982, Banks drank large quantities of straight gin and took prescription drugs at his home on Schoolhouse Lane in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.[5]  The next morning on September 25, 1982, he used an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to kill eight people in his house, including three women in their 20s (all girlfriends and mothers of his children) and five children, four of them his. Two of the women were sisters.[6] Banks dressed in military fatigues and went outside, where he saw 22-year-old Jimmy Olsen and 24-year-old Ray Hall, Jr, leaving a house across the street. He shot them both, reportedly yelling that they \"would not tell anyone about this\" before firing. He hit both men, fatally wounding Hall; Olsen survived. Banks drove away.\nBanks went to Heather Highlands mobile home park, where his former girlfriend Sharon Mazzillo and their son Kissamayu lived, of whom he had been trying to gain custody. Banks forced his way in and shot Mazzillo. He then shot and killed his sleeping son. Banks killed Sharon\u2019s mother, who was trying to call the police, and Sharon's 7-year-old nephew, who was also in the home. Sharon\u2019s brother hid in the closet, whom Banks did not see. He was the only survivor and called the police, identifying Banks as the shooter.[citation needed]\nWhen police examined the victims at the mobile home park, they connected it to Olsen and Hall's shooting, which had been discovered at Schoolhouse Lane. They next found Banks's victims in his house. Police began to search for Banks, who abandoned his car and carjacked another vehicle. After abandoning the stolen vehicle, Banks stopped in an isolated grassy area to rest and fell asleep.[citation needed]\nAfter Banks awoke, he visited his mother's house (also in Wilkes-Barre.) He was said to confess his crimes to her. She drove him to the house of Jacob Whitt, a friend of Banks, where he sent her away and prepared for a standoff with police.[7]\nA standoff between Banks and police began. The police brought his mother to their base to talk with Banks. They tried various tactics to get the murderer to surrender, including having a false news report played over WILK radio saying that the children were alive and needed blood to survive. The police tried other tactics to draw Banks out of the house. Finally, Robert Brunson, a former co-worker of Banks, was able to talk him out after a 4-hour standoff.[8] As of September 30, 1982, Banks was charged with eight counts of murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, grand theft auto, armed robbery, and felonious theft. Banks was held without bail.[9]\n[10]\n",

From near Grantsville, Maryland north to Ebensburg, Pennsylvania, US 219 is Corridor N of the Appalachian Development Highway System.  From Meyersdale, Pennsylvania to just south of Carrolltown, Pennsylvania, US 219 is a limited-access highway.  From Carrolltown US 219 runs largely as a two-lane road to DuBois, Pennsylvania, through which it runs as Brady Street, and then returns to a two-lane road after a junction with Interstate 80. US 219 runs directly through the towns of Brockway, Ridgway, and Johnsonburg before reaching Wilcox, where PA Route 321 splits and heads for the town of Kane.  US 219 continues north as a two-lane road until reaching Bradford, where it becomes a limited-access highway and remains so until reaching the New York border. On August 9, 2007, Pennsylvania State Transportation Secretary Allen D. Biehler unveiled four signs along US Route 219 that dedicated the portion of the route in Somerset County, Pennsylvania as the Flight 93 Memorial Highway.[2]\nUS 219 enters Pennsylvania from Maryland in Elk Lick Township, Somerset County, heading north as a two-lane undivided road through rural areas of farmland and woodland. The road intersects PA 669 in Salisbury before turning to the northeast. The route becomes a four-lane freeway and bypasses Meyersdale to the west, with US 219 Business serving the town. From here, US 219 continues north along the freeway toward Somerset. US 219 bypasses Somerset to the east and passes over the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-70/I-76). The route interchanges with PA 281 before coming to a ramp with PA 601 that provides access to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The road comes to the US 30 exit east of Jennerstown and heads through more areas of farms and woods, interchanging with PA 601 again followed by PA 403 northwest of Benson.[1][3]\nUS 219 crosses the Stonycreek River into Cambria County and heads near suburban residential and commercial development southeast of Johnstown, coming to an interchange with PA 56. At this point, PA 56 forms a concurrency with US 219 and the road comes to an interchange with PA 756. PA 56 splits to the northwest onto a freeway at the next interchange and US 219 comes to an interchange with Galleria Drive, which provides access to The Johnstown Galleria shopping mall. The freeway heads into more rural areas of woods with some farms and reaches an interchange with PA 869 near the Johnstown Flood National Memorial. The next interchange along the US 219 freeway is with PA 53 in Summerhill. From this point, the road heads north through more rural areas, with a northbound exit and entrance at Tower Road. The route continues to the Ebensburg area, where it interchanges with US 22. From here, US 219 continues through wooded areas to the west of Ebensburg, coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of the western segment of US 422. North of Ebensburg, the freeway segment of US 219 ends and the road heads north onto a two-lane undivided surface road, passing through more farmland and woodland. South of Carrolltown, the road intersects PA 553. After passing through Carrolltown, the route heads northwest, coming to an intersection with PA 271 in Northern Cambria. After this, US 219 begins to follow the West Branch Susquehanna River and curves to the north again, passing through forests and intersecting PA 240.[1][3]\nUS 219 passes through Cherry Tree in Indiana County and intersects PA 580.[1][3] US 219 continues into Clearfield County and passes through more forested areas, running through Burnside and coming to an intersection with PA 286. The road continues northeast alongside the West Branch Susquehanna River and comes to a junction with PA 36, heading east concurrent with that route. In Mahaffey, US 219 splits to the northeast and passes through more wooded areas while following the river, intersecting with PA 969 and splitting from the river. In Grampian, the route reaches an intersection with PA 729 and PA 879, where it turns to the northwest. US 219 curves to the north again and continues through more woodland with some farms, curving to the northwest. The route comes to an intersection with US 322 in Luthersburg and forms a concurrency with that route, coming to a junction with PA 410 a short distance later. South of DuBois, US 322 splits from US 219 by heading to the west and US 219 continues northwest to an intersection with the northern terminus of US 119, turning north at this point. The route heads into developed areas of homes and businesses in DuBois, widening into a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane as it approaches the intersection with PA 255. Here, US 219 turns west onto a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and passes through more developed areas of the city. The road leaves DuBois and heads through more rural areas with some development, widening into a four-lane divided highway and intersecting PA 830 before coming to an interchange with I-80.[1][3]\n",

        "paragraph": "William Walter Remington (1917\u20131954) was an economist employed in various federal government positions until his career was interrupted by accusations of espionage made by the Soviet spy and defector Elizabeth Bentley. He was convicted of perjury in connection with these charges in 1953, and murdered in prison in 1954.[1]\nWilliam Walter Remington was born on October 25, 1917, in New York City and raised in Ridgewood,[2] in Bergen County, New Jersey, by Lillian Maude Sutherland (1888-1969) and Frederick C. Remington (1870\u20131956).[3][4] His father worked for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.;[5] his mother was an art teacher in New York.[2] Remington was admitted to Dartmouth College at age 16, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude in 1939, and earned a Master's degree from Columbia University in 1940.[2][6] Coming from a branch of the wealthy Remington family of Illion, New York, Remington's parents were demanding and he developed a somewhat unconventional and flamboyant personality. From an early age, he was drawn to radical leftist politics, and declared to his friends that he was a Communist when he was 15. In college, he became active with members of the Young Communist League, and later the Communist Party of the United States. In testimony, Remington stated that while he was a Republican when he entered college, he \"moved left quite rapidly\" and became a radical but was never a Communist Party or Young Communist League member at Dartmouth.[7] Whether or not he ever officially joined the party later became a point of contention in his legal battles.\nRemington was employed in a number of posts, principally as an economist:\nFor his position with the Office of Price Administration, Remington was required to undergo a loyalty-security check, which began in 1941. He admitted having been active in Communist-allied groups such as the American Peace Mobilization, but denied any sympathy with communism and swore under oath that he was not and had never been a member of the Communist Party. His leftist affiliations raised concerns, but the investigation was superficial and his security clearance was approved.[citation needed]\nIn March 1942 and continuing for two years, Remington had occasional meetings with Elizabeth Bentley at which he passed her information. This material included data on airplane production and other matters concerning the aircraft industry, as well as some information on an experimental process for manufacturing synthetic rubber.[9] Remington later claimed that he was unaware that Bentley was connected with the Communist Party, that he believed she was a journalist and researcher, and that the information he gave her was not secret. Bentley was a Communist and an espionage agent for the Soviet Union, who in 1945 broke with the Communists and became an informer for the FBI. She then implicated a number of her contacts, including Remington. Bentley's revelations of Soviet espionage activities in the United States received a great deal of press attention. She identified more than 80 Americans\u2014including several employees of government offices\u2014as working for the Soviets, of whom only William Remington was still working in a government position.\nActing on Bentley's information, the FBI began secret surveillance of Remington in late 1945. Remington was by this time disillusioned with communism and had broken off his relationships with radical organizations, so the investigation revealed nothing of interest.[10]\nIn 1946, Remington was working with the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion. From there he transferred in March 1947 to a position with the President's Council of Economic Advisers, where he was paid an annual salary of $10,305.[8] Because the FBI was keeping Bentley's testimony and its investigation of Remington secret, it raised no objection, with the result that Remington remained in fairly high-level government posts.\nIn 1947, Remington was interviewed by the FBI and also questioned before a federal grand jury in New York City about the information he had given to Elizabeth Bentley. He testified that no secret information was involved, and the issue seemed to end there. In an apparent attempt to bolster belief in his innocence, Remington became an anti-communist informer from this time and for the following year. He sent the FBI information on over fifty people, only four of whom were connected with his own case. Most of those he named he had never met. He accused them of being Communists, isolationists, Negro nationalists, or \"extreme liberals.\" He also verbally attacked his wife Ann, from whom he was now estranged, and his mother-in-law Elizabeth Moos, both avowed Communists.\nAnother loyalty investigation of Remington was opened early in 1948, and in June, he was relieved of his duties pending the findings of that investigation. In July of that year, the New York World-Telegram published a series of articles about Elizabeth Bentley, and the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations opened hearings to investigate her charges. At these hearings, Bentley made her accusations against Remington public and Remington in turn denied them. The Washington Post called him \"a boob...who was duped by clever Communist agents.\" At his loyalty review hearings, Remington downplayed his earlier connections with Communist and leftist organizations and claimed that his wife's adherence to Communist doctrine was the reason for the end of their marriage.\nWhile testifying before the Senate, Bentley was protected from libel suits. When she repeated her charge that Remington was a Communist on NBC Radio's Meet the Press, he sued her and NBC for libel. At this point, Remington's case acquired considerable notoriety. When Remington's lawyers attempted to subpoena Bentley, she initially could not be found, prompting headlines of \"RED WITNESS \"MISSING\" AT 100-G SLANDER SUIT\" and the like. When she finally reappeared, she was subpoenaed for the libel suit. She refused to testify at Remington's loyalty hearing. The Loyalty Review Board noted that the only serious evidence against Remington was \"the uncorroborated statement of a woman who refuses to submit herself to cross-examination,\"[11] and cleared Remington to return to his government post. The libel suit was settled out of court shortly thereafter, with NBC paying Remington $10,000.[12]\n",

        "paragraph": "Elizabeth Wilson (c.1762\u00a0\u2013 January 3, 1786) was an American whose execution by hanging for the purported murder of her children in southeastern Pennsylvania during the immediate post-Revolutionary War period made her a folklore figure in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Although her responsibility for the children's deaths had not been definitively established, the hanging was carried out and a pardon, granted by the state and entrusted to her brother, William, was not delivered in time to stop the execution. There was tremendous popular interest in her story, which quickly evolved into a tale of moral failing and divine redemption. Following his sister's death, William became a recluse, popularly known as The Pennsylvania Hermit.\nIn some sources, William and Elizabeth are referred to as Amos Wilson and Harriot Wilson. However, the historical record leaves no doubt that the Hermit and his sister were named William and Elizabeth. The origin of these \"alternate\" names has never been fully explained.\nMany key elements of the Wilsons' saga are documented in the records of the Chester County Courts and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. However, the story quickly became a part of local folklore and was embellished by generations of storytellers. It is possible to note which elements of the tale are a part of the historical record and which might be considered suspect. However, \"the Wilson Story\" might best be considered historical fiction, as the popular tale incorporates elements of both, and even scholarly discussions of the events are at odds regarding certain details. The following is a synthesis of numerous, often conflicting sources and is best regarded as historical fiction.\nVery little background information has survived regarding the Wilson family. According to one account, William and Elizabeth's father was a farmer named John Wilson. John's first wife, and the children's mother, was also named Elizabeth.[1]\nSources are divided regarding Elizabeth's age. Some report that she was nineteen when she died (born ca. 1766), others that she was twenty-seven (born ca. 1758).[1][2][3] There is no record of other siblings, and some accounts specify that Elizabeth was her parents' only daughter and William their only son. Elizabeth was said to have been born in East Marlborough Township, in central Chester County.[1]\n(Prior to 1789, Chester County included all of present-day Delaware County, and Chester was the county seat. Chester then served as the seat of Delaware County until the seat was moved to Media in 1851.)\nThe Wilson family lived in Chester County, most likely in East Bradford or West Bradford Township.[4][5][6] Theirs was a farm family of modest means but solid reputation. During the American Revolution, they sided with the British, and much of their property was confiscated by American forces., Mrs. Wilson died while the children were still young. Their father later remarried, but his second wife did not care for her stepchildren. She encouraged their father to send them away as soon as they were of age.[7]\nAt sixteen, William was apprenticed to a stone carver in Lancaster County.[2][7] Elizabeth's activities after leaving her father's house are less certain. Some accounts tell that she was sent to work at the Indian Queen Tavern in Philadelphia.  Others suggest that she was a social butterfly who simply frequented the Indian Queen.[8] Some portray her as a chaste and virtuous country girl, a devout Christian  who made a terrible mistake.[9][10] Others describe her as much more worldly, and one even reports another, earlier, out-of-wedlock pregnancy that ended in stillbirth.[citation needed] In early 1784 a George Magoleher  was tried in Chester after being arrested \"for fouling upon the body of Elizabeth Wilson,\" although it is not certain that this Elizabeth was the Hermit's sister. (Court documents reveal that this Elizabeth's father was named Thomas Wilson.)[11] The Faithful Narrative also includes a lurid jailhouse confession attributed to Elizabeth in which she admits to several out-of-wedlock pregnancies.[1][12]\nElizabeth is invariably described as exceedingly beautiful and always surrounded by admirers, but as with other portions of her tale, there are several versions of how she met her seducer. In one, she was invited to a wedding in nearby Hock-Hossing (perhaps Hockessin in Delaware), where she met a friend of the groom.[12] In several others, she met a man named \"Smith,\" either a native of Philadelphia or an officer from New Jersey.[2][4][7] In still others, she met a man identified as either \"Captain D_____\" or Joseph Deshong[13] at the Indian Queen.[3] Deshong was alternately an American officer or the Sheriff of Sussex County, New Jersey.[1][14] Whatever his name or his origin, the cad manipulated Elizabeth with false promises of marriage and \"succeeded in depriving her of all that could render her respectable in the eyes of the world.\"[2] He then disappeared, leaving Elizabeth pregnant. In one telling she learns that her former lover has taken up with a wealthy widow in another city, in another that he was already married to another woman.[2] Elizabeth remained at the Indian Queen, and as her pregnancy became obvious, she became the focus of scorn and gossip. Eventually, her presence became too great an embarrassment, and she was made to leave.[8]\n",

It was originally built in 1909,[3] on piles with a concrete substructure supporting concrete retaining walls with solid fill and wood-block paving, designed to carry loads of up to 500\u00a0pounds per square foot.[4][5]  Similar methods of construction were used for other piers on the Philadelphia waterfront[6] The pier was originally used by steamship lines for loading and unloading freight.  In 1932 and 1947, it was owned by the Reading Railroad.  In 1932, in addition to ships of the Ward Line, which shipped general freight to and from Cuba and Mexico, the pier was open to any shipper for a fee.[5][7]\nBy 1975, the pier was owned and operated by the Independent Pier Company.[8] By 1992, the pier was the site of Eli's Pier 34, which in September of that year was the venue for a boxing match between Bernard Hopkins and Eric Rhinehart.[9]\nThe nightclub Club Heat opened just a week before the disaster, on the section of the pier farthest from shore.\nThe collapse occurred around 8 PM while the nightclub was occupied, as a section of the pier (already showing signs of shifting), fell into the cold spring waters of the Delaware River.  Strong river currents, lack of light, and a large amount of debris combined with additional threats of collapse from the sections of pier still standing hampered rescue efforts.[10]\nThe three women who died  - Jean Marie Ferraro, 27, of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, Monica Kristina Rodriguez, 21, also of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and DeAnn White, 25, of Philadelphia - were coworkers at the Camden Aquarium out celebrating White's birthday.[11]\nBased on evidence that showed both men were aware that the pier was in danger of collapse and did little to prevent it,[citation needed] the owner of Pier 34, Michael Asbell, and the Manager of Club Heat, Eli Karetny, were charged by the Philadelphia District Attorneys Office with third-degree murder and other charges, but during deliberations, the jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision.\nFearing facing another trial, they both pleaded guilty. They were sentenced to over 9 months of house arrest and 1,000 hours of community service.[12]\n",

Gosnell was convicted of the murders of three infants who were born alive after using drugs to induce birth, was convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of one woman during an abortion procedure, and was convicted of several other medically related crimes.[3][4][5][6][7]\nGosnell, based in the Mantua neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned and operated the Women's Medical Society Clinic, a non-compliant abortion clinic that was dubbed a \"house of horrors\" during the trial.[8] He was a prolific prescriber of OxyContin.[9] In 2011, Gosnell, his wife Pearl, and eight employees were charged with a total of 32 felonies and 227 misdemeanors in connection with deaths, illegal medical services, and regulatory violations. Pearl and the eight employees pleaded guilty to various charges in 2011 while Gosnell pleaded not guilty and sought a jury trial.[10]\nIn May 2013, Gosnell was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of three of the infants and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, an adult patient at the clinic following an abortion procedure. Gosnell was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour informed consent law. After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.[11][12] Gosnell was sentenced to an additional 30 years in prison for federal drug charges.[13]\nGosnell was born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the only child of a gas station operator and a government clerk[14] in an African-American family.[15] He was a student at the city's Central High School from which he graduated in 1959.[16][17] Gosnell initially attended the University of Pennsylvania,[18] then graduated from Dickinson College with a bachelor's degree.[19] He received his medical degree at the Thomas Jefferson University in 1966.[16]\nIt has been reported that Gosnell spent four decades practicing medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and a teen aid program.[16] He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua.[14][20] Gosnell told The Philadelphia Inquirer in October 1972: \"As a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them.\"[21]\nThat same year, Gosnell also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental \"Super Coil\" method invented by Harvey Karman. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. However, complications from the procedure were reported by nine of the women, with three of these reporting severe complications.[22][23]\nThe 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a \"respected man\" in his community, and a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce's \"Young Philadelphian of the Year\" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House.[21] By the late 1980s, however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien.[21]\nGosnell has been married three times. His third and current wife, Pearl, had worked at the Women's Medical Society as a full-time medical assistant from 1982 until their marriage in 1990.[1]  They have two children.[24] Gosnell has four other children from his two previous marriages.[24] In covering his background, media commentators drew attention to the \"incredibly diverse\" portrayals of Gosnell, touching on both his community works \u2013 the creation of the halfway house and teen aid program \u2013 contrasted with portrayals of his practice as an abortion mill in which viable fetuses and babies were routinely killed following illegal late-term procedures.[16]\n",

One of the victims was a pregnant woman, whose unborn baby was added to the number of fatalities on the day after the shooting.  Two men, Cheron Shelton and Robert Thomas, were charged in connection with the shooting, but charges against Thomas were later dropped and Shelton was acquitted at trial in 2020.\nThe shooting occurred while the victims were holding a backyard party at which about fifteen people were present at the time. According to officials, shortly before 11:00 p.m., one gunman who was situated in a nearby alley fired shots from a .40-caliber pistol and forced several people onto the back porch. The other gunman, equipped with a 7.62 mm caliber rifle and situated in the yard of an adjacent residence, then ambushed and shot the victims as they tried to enter the house through a backdoor. Afterwards, the gunmen fled the scene on foot.[1][3][4]\nWitnesses reported hearing 30\u201340 gunshots;[5] a total of 48 shell casings were recovered from the scene.[6] Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala described the shooting as a \"planned and calculated\" attack.[4] He added that he believed one or two of the victims may have been targeted and the rest were collateral damage.[5] A $20,000 reward for information on the shooting was announced.[4]\nFour people died at the scene and a fifth died after being taken to UPMC Mercy.[1][3][7][8][9] On March 10, the eight-month-old fetus of one of the victims was added to the list of fatalities, bringing the death toll to six.[1] The victims are:[6]\nThree others were injured in the shooting. Two of them, both men, were in critical condition, while the third, a woman, was treated and released.[1] One survivor, 51-year-old John Ellis, died on September 15, 2020, after being taken to UPMC Mercy Hospital for complications. It was not immediately clear if the cause of death could be attributed to the shooting, which caused a spinal cord injury that left Ellis paralyzed from the waist down.[10]\nOn June 23, 2016, Zappala announced that charges were being filed against Cheron Shelton (no relation to Jerry and Tina Shelton) and Robert Thomas, who had long been considered prime suspects. Their alleged target was Lamont Powell, one of the injured victims. He was allegedly targeted as revenge for his suspected role in the 2013 murder of Shelton's friend, Calvin Doswell, in Pittsburgh's Lincoln-Lemington neighborhood.[2] The case against Robert Thomas was later dismissed.[11] Cheron Shelton was later found not guilty in the shooting.[12] Cheron Shelton later pled guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon.[13] Cheron Shelton was later sentenced to eight years in prison.[14]\nPennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf issued a statement offering support and assistance in the investigation. U.S. Representative Keith Rothfus called the shooting a \"senseless act of violence\" and expressed his condolences to the families of the victims.[6] U.S. Senator Bob Casey, Jr. issued a statement urging more action to be taken against the issue of gun violence.[3]\n",

Bruno was known as \"the Gentle Don\" due to his preference for conciliation over violence, in stark contrast to his successors.[1]\nBorn in Villalba, Province of Caltanissetta, Sicily, Bruno immigrated to the United States as a child and settled in South Philadelphia with his brother, Vito.[3] He was the son of a foundry worker who opened a small grocery store at 4341 North Sixth Street in Feltonville, Philadelphia. Angelo helped his father at the store until 1922, at the age of twelve when he first entered school but attended for only a few years before dropping out of South Philadelphia High School to open his own grocery store at Eighth and Annin streets in Passyunk Square, Philadelphia. Bruno was a close associate of New York Gambino crime family boss Carlo Gambino. Living with Bruno was a cousin of mobster John Simone. Bruno dropped the name Annaloro and replaced it with his paternal grandmother's maiden name, Bruno. His sponsor into the Philadelphia mafia was Michael Maggio, a convicted murderer with a national reputation, and the founder of M. Maggio Cheese Corp. (since bought up by Crowley Foods).\nBruno was married to Assunta \"Sue\" Bruno (n\u00e9e Maranca; 1913\u20132007), his childhood sweetheart, from 1931 until his death.[4] They had two children, Michael and Jean.[4] Bruno owned an extermination company in Trenton, New Jersey, an aluminum products company in Hialeah, Florida, and a share in the Plaza Hotel in Havana, Cuba. Bruno's first arrest was in 1928 for reckless driving. Subsequent arrests included firearms violations, operating an illicit alcohol still, illegal gambling, and receiving stolen property.\nIn 1959, Bruno succeeded Joseph Ida as boss of the Philadelphia family. Over the next twenty years, Bruno successfully avoided the intense media and law enforcement scrutiny and outbursts of violence that plagued other crime families. Bruno himself avoided lengthy prison terms despite several arrests; his longest term was two years for refusing to testify before a grand jury. Bruno forbade family involvement in narcotics trafficking, preferring more traditional Cosa Nostra operations, such as bookmaking and loansharking. However, Bruno did permit other gangs to distribute heroin in Philadelphia for a share of the proceeds. This arrangement angered some family members who wanted a share of the drug-dealing profits.\nBruno preferred to operate through bribery and soft power rather than murder. For example, he banished violent soldier Nicodemo \"Little Nicky\" Scarfo to the then-backwater of Atlantic City, New Jersey after he was charged with manslaughter.[5]\nOn March 21, 1980, the 69-year-old Bruno was killed by a shotgun blast to the head as he sat in his car in front of his home near the intersection of 10th Street and Snyder Avenue in the Lower Moyamensing neighborhood of South Philadelphia; his driver, John Stanfa, was wounded.[6] It is believed that the killing was ordered by Antonio Caponigro, Bruno's consigliere. A few weeks later, Caponigro's lifeless body was found, naked and battered, in the trunk of a car in the Bronx.[7][8] The Commission had reportedly ordered Caponigro's murder because he assassinated Bruno without their sanction. Other Philadelphia family members found to be involved in Bruno's murder were tortured and killed.\nThe murder sparked a mob war in Philadelphia, which claimed over 20 lives over the next four years, including the succeeding boss Philip \"Chicken Man\" Testa, and his son Salvatore Testa.[9]\nIn February 2016, author and historian Celeste Morello began an effort to designate Bruno's home a historical landmark.[10] In March 2016, a historical landmark advisory committee ruled against the request.[11]\nBruno is portrayed by Chazz Palminteri in the film Legend (2015) and Harvey Keitel in the film The Irishman (2019).[12]\n",

He contacted James Swearingen, the favorite composer of the Community Band's director, to write the piece.  When Swearingen realized Somerset's proximity to Shanksville, both thought it fitting to have the piece honor the heroes of United Airlines Flight 93.  Without a grant to cover part of the cost, the project was not possible, and so the Somerset Eagles Aerie 1801 and Ladies Auxiliary stepped forward to pay the entire amount.

        "paragraph": "The Philadelphia poison ring was a murder for hire gang led by Italian immigrant cousins, Herman and Paul Petrillo, in 1930s Philadelphia, where the Italian community had almost doubled in 20 years from 76,734 in 1910 (the year the Petrillos arrived in the country) to over 155,000 by 1930 - just before the murder ring began operations. The activities of the ring came to light in 1938 and the cousins were ultimately convicted of first degree murder and executed by electric chair in 1941.\nA Russian-Jewish immigrant gang member, Morris Bolber, known as 'Louie, the Rabbi', turned state's evidence. Gang members, associates and 'dupes' (many of them Italian-born, superstitious women, dubbed 'poison widows' by an excited press) were brought to trial and mostly convicted to death sentences (later commuted) or varying prison sentences. One or two were found not guilty, notably the widow Stella Alfonsi, whose husband's 1938 death by poison brought the case to light, and who was successfully defended by the lawyer Raymond Pace Alexander.\nHerman and Paul Petrillo were cousins. Herman was an expert counterfeiter and arsonist, with contacts in the criminal world, while Paul ran an insurance scam business from the back of his tailor's shop and aspired to a paid consultancy in 'la fattura', a magic believed in and resorted to by many in South Philadelphia's Italian community. The murders began in 1931, with Herman enlisting associate thugs to kill men he had arranged to insure, to collect on the double indemnity accident insurance.\nHerman ruthlessly and euphemistically described this as \"sending [them] to California\". Two victims, Ralph Caruso and Joseph Arena were both drowned and bludgeoned on separate fishing trips. While a third victim, John Woloshyn, was first bludgeoned and then repeatedly run over by a car. Meanwhile, Herman tried to steer clear of repeated attempts by the authorities to bring him to justice for insurance fraud, arson and currency counterfeiting.\nAs the Depression deepened, the Petrillos headed an informal gang, now including Morris Bolber and other self-styled 'fattuchierie' (wise women, witches) such as Maria Carina Favato, Josephine Sedita and Rose Carina, who offered superstitious, unhappily married, murderous or merely gullible women incantations, powders and potions to adjust their lives. These 'love potions' usually contained arsenic, or antimony, and they were invariably accompanied by excessive insurance policies on the victims, often made out in favour of gang members rather than the supposed 'poison widow' beneficiaries.\nThe gang embraced insurance agents and made highly successful use of the period's widespread cheap insurance policies, often taken out without medical examination (not required for policies under $500) or the knowledge of the principal concerned, who would subsequently meet an agonising death by arsenic, engineered by the spouse; possibly with intent, possibly in superstitious ignorance of their actions. This went on from 1932 until 1938, when the death of Ferdinando Alfonsi in a hospital brought matters into the open.\nVincent P. McDevitt was an Assistant District Attorney in Philadelphia. In early 1939, the District Attorney, Charles F. Kelley, assigned him to the homicide case of Ferdinando Alfonsi, who had died on 27 October 1938. McDevitt immediately had information from two undercover detectives, agents Landvoight and Phillips. From them, McDevitt had an informant, one George Meyer, who ran a local upholstery cleaning business.[1]\nMeyer encountered Herman Petrillo when he was trying to obtain money for his business. Petrillo had offered to provide him with a large sum of money in both legal tender and counterfeit, if Meyer would perform the hit on Alfonsi. Landvoight and Meyer had played along with the murder plot, with Meyer hoping for an advance pay-out and Landvoight hoping to finally bust Petrillo's counterfeiting crimes.[2] Working undercover, Landvoight helped Meyer \"play along,\" as the Petrillos plotted the murder that they wanted Meyer to carry out.\nThe plan was to steal or buy a car, take Alfonsi out to a dark country road and hit him with the car, thus making the murder look accidental.[3] Herman Petrillo preferred the idea to steal the car rather than buy one, but Landvoight and Phillips were hoping to convince Petrillo to give them money to buy a car for the murder, as it would give them the opportunity that Phillips had so long prayed for, to arrest him on counterfeit charges. In the end, Petrillo sold them some fake tender, ostensibly for buying a means of transportation to the planned crime scene.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "James Edward Brewton (November 4, 1930 \u2013 May 11, 1967) was an American painter and printmaker who synthesized expressionism, graffiti and Pataphysics.\nHe was born November 4, 1930, in Toledo, Ohio, and died by suicide in Philadelphia at age 36, on May 11, 1967. At the time of his death, Brewton was beginning to distinguish himself as one of Philadelphia's premier painters and printmakers.\nWhile in his teens, Brewton studied drawing at the Toledo Museum of Art and painting with John Charvet. At 21, Brewton joined the Marines and served in the Korean War. He did surprisingly well, climbing to the rank of sergeant. Combat changed him, however: He became a pacifist, protesting the Vietnam War and painting antiwar works. Brewton's health was wrecked, and he was increasingly plagued by debilitating spine problems.\nAlthough Brewton's style became expressionistic and inspired by graffiti, his training was traditional. Taking advantage of the G.I. Bill, he studied at the Ruskin School at Oxford in 1954-55 and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (PAFA) from 1955 through 1958. At PAFA, Brewton was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Franklin C. Watkins and Hobson Pittman. Pittman owned a self-portrait by Brewton, which he featured during tours of his art collection (like the one organized by the Radcliffe Club of Philadelphia in 1961)[1] and exhibited in the show, \"Paintings, Drawings, Prints, and Sculpture Collected and Owned by Fourteen Philadelphia Artists.\"\nMarcel Duchamp was a guest lecturer at PAFA, and Brewton riffed off of Duchamp's work throughout his life. At The Print Club, where Brewton worked on weekends, he first saw the work of Asger Jorn and was greatly impressed by the wildly expressive and colorful work of the CoBrA group. Brewton later befriended Jorn, living in Denmark for months at a time.[2][3] Other strong influences were Andr\u00e9 Breton and Alfred Jarry. These European, avant-garde inspirations were unusual for a Philadelphia-based artist in the 1950s.\nBrewton's work won awards and prizes,[4][5] and he was championed by critics in Philadelphia and New York while still a student.[6][7] \"Mr. Brewton's career was launched dramatically,\" ran his obituary in The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1967, \"when his canvas \u2018The Suicide of Judas\u2019 won the prestigious $1000 Schiedt prize \u2026. the tall ex-marine sergeant, a veteran of the Korean War, thus captured\u2014at the very early age of 28\u2014the same award William Glackens, Stuart Davis, Hans Hofmann, Ivan Albright and Charles Burchfield had earned in their maturity.\"[8]\nFrom his base in Philadelphia, Brewton traveled whenever he could, to Spain, France, England and Denmark. He and his then-partner, writer Barbara Holland, lived in Denmark during much of 1962. In early 1964, Brewton lent several works he owned to the Philadelphia Museum of Art's Asger Jorn exhibition.[9]\nIn the last years of his life, Brewton was represented by Harry Kulkowitz's Kenmore Galleries, on Rittenhouse Square in Philadelphia. His prints were selling well, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art holds several in its permanent collection. From his colorful, CoBrA-inspired phase, Brewton had progressed to muted, wall-like pieces incorporating graffiti. By 1965, the works had evolved into a synthesis of graffiti (\"anonymous and therefore for all mankind\") [10] and Alfred Jarry's philosophy of 'Pataphysics. Brewton called these works \"Graffiti Pataphysic\" and also continued to paint portraits.\nBy the time he died in 1967, Brewton had \"had several one-man shows, and museum curators were beginning to exhibit interest,\" as Nessa Forman wrote in The Philadelphia Inquirer. \"There was an artist,\" Forman continued, \"who was ahead of his time, who was brilliant, sensitive and nonviolent, who loved his art and just wanted to paint. And he committed suicide\u2026.\"[11]\n",

Three people were arrested as initial suspects in the case: Linda Weston, Gregory Thomas and Eddie Wright. A fourth person, Jean McIntosh, the daughter of Weston, was arrested on October 19. Ten people, including six children, were taken into custody on October 18 in connection with the discovery. A niece of Weston's, Beatrice Weston (19), was among them, and was found to be malnourished and suffering from multiple wounds. She had been reported missing in 2009. A Police investigator stated he had never seen such signs of abuse on a living person.\nAn investigation by the FBI and the Philadelphia Police Department is currently[when?] underway to determine if the suspects were part of a larger multi-state kidnapping scheme, as identifying papers of at least 50 other people were found in the initial search. Evidence so far suggests that people had been held for collection of their Social Security Disability benefits, as the four people initially found were mentally disabled.\nWeston had previously been sentenced to eight years in prison for starving a man to death after he refused to support Weston's sister's unborn child. She served four years of her sentence.[1] She had been given a diagnosis of schizophrenia at the time. Records show a person living with Weston in 2008 died that year, from what was at the time listed as natural causes. The person's family has asked that her death be reexamined. As of December 2011, more charges had been filed in the case against Weston, involving events dating to 2002.[2]\nThe kidnapping received national and international attention, and raised awareness of the issue of the potential abuse of mentally disabled people for their benefits through the representative payee process.[3][4][5]\nIn January 2013, the four original defendants, and a fifth, Nicklaus Woodard, of West Palm Beach, Florida,  were charged by a federal grand jury with a total of 196 criminal counts, including hate crime charges. All five were charged with four counts of a hate crime, conspiracy, racketeering, and kidnapping. Weston, Mcintosh, and Thomas were charged with involuntary servitude. Weston was charged with two counts of murder, with confinement and abuse allegedly causing the deaths of two victims.[6] She was sentenced in September 2015 to life plus 80 years, admitting to all 196 federal counts against her, including murder, kidnapping, sex trafficking, hate crimes, forced labor, and benefits fraud.[7]\nJean McIntosh pleaded guilty in December 2014 to charges including conspiracy to commit racketeering, hate crimes against disabled people, and kidnapping resulting in death.[8]\n",

It is home to a number of stores, restaurants, bars, and performance venues. The Theatre of Living Arts, which is located in between Third and Fourth Streets, where the shooting took place, was hosting the band Dying Fetus. Close to South Street is the Philadelphia Gayborhood, which had been the site of gay pride events that day, as part of Pride Month.[2]\nThe shooting took place on a Saturday night, which is when South Street is typically most crowded. On the weekends, South Street is shut down to traffic, and during the summertime weekends, there is a large police presence. However, according to local business owners, police did not enforce the curfew for teenagers, or the ordinances restricting loud music and ATVs. Prior to the shooting, at 9 pm, two men could be seen brandishing firearms in the waists of their pants, which caused onlookers to flee.[3]\nPolice reported that the shooting took place on Fourth and South Street around 11:30pm.[2] Cellphone footage prior to the shooting that was corroborated by The Philadelphia Inquirer showed a heated confrontation and fistfight preceding the gunfire. Two men approached a third man, who was standing outside a Rita's Italian Ice.[3] The men were later identified as Rashaan Vereen, Gregory Jackson, and Mika Townes. The video shows Jackson and Townes arguing before Jackson pulled out a gun.[4] Jackson and Vereen began to fight Townes for about 15 seconds before Jackson opened fire and hit Townes, who then returned fire and killed Jackson.[3] Vereen is seen in video footage, picking up Jackson's gun and handing it off to another individual in a blue hoodie before staying with Jackson.[4] As a result of the gunfire, a third shooter, Quran Garner, returned fire down the street.[5]\nResponding officers began to focus on Garner who had pointed his weapon at officers and opened fire striking Garner. Garner was transported to the hospital for his wounds and later arrested. A Philadelphia police captain said that officers first heard gunshots near Second and South Streets and saw multiple shooters. The shooting resulted in chaos on South Street with people sprinting to flee the area. Amid the chaos, trash cans were knocked over and car windows were smashed.[3]\nAt least five guns were fired during the shooting.[3] Weapons recovered at the scene included two-semi automatic handguns, one of which had an extended magazine.[2] At the time of the shooting, both Jackson and Townes had licenses to carry while Garner did not have a license to carry a gun.[4]\nPolice identified the three victims who were killed; their ages were 22, 27, and 34.[2][3] Police said two of them were bystanders with no connection to the suspects.[3]\nThirteen people were injured and were taken to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Pennsylvania Hospital, and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center.[2] The victims ranged in age between 17 and 69 years old, with a majority believed to be innocent bystanders.[4] A shooting suspect was taken to Penn Presbyterian Medical Center and treated for a gunshot wound to the forearm.[2]\n",

After being apprehended by police, Wells was murdered when an explosive collar locked to his neck detonated. A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into the murder uncovered a complex plot described as \"one of the most complicated and bizarre crimes in the annals of the FBI\".[1]\nIn conjunction with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP), the FBI investigation led to Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong and Kenneth Barnes being charged with the crime in 2007. The investigation determined the plot was masterminded by Diehl-Armstrong to receive an inheritance by hiring Barnes with the money from the bank robbery to kill her father. William Rothstein and Floyd Stockton were also found to have conspired in the crime, but Rothstein died before being charged and Stockton was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against Diehl-Armstrong. Diehl-Armstrong was sentenced in 2011 to life in prison, without the possibility of parole, and Barnes received a reduced sentence of 22.5 years in exchange for testifying against Diehl-Armstrong; both died in prison.\nWells' involvement in the plot is a matter of controversy. Investigators concluded Wells was a willing participant in the bank robbery, but was told the bomb was fake. Wells' family said he was forced to rob the bank by the conspirators. Known as the \"collar bomb\" and \"pizza bomber\" case, the incident gained extensive media coverage, including the 2018 Netflix series Evil Genius.\nBrian Wells was born in Warren, Pennsylvania, to Rose and Harold Wells, the latter of whom was a Korean War veteran. In 1973, when Wells was a 16-year-old sophomore, he dropped out of Erie's East High School and went to work as a mechanic.[2]\nAt Kenneth Barnes' home, he, Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, and William Rothstein discussed ways they could make money. Diehl-Armstrong suggested Barnes kill her father, Harold Diehl, so she would receive an inheritance. Barnes told her he was willing to do this for US$250,000 (equivalent to $368,262 in 2021).[3]  The collar bomb-bank robbery plot was hatched to obtain enough money to pay Barnes to kill Diehl-Armstrong's father.[a] In return for a reduced sentence, Barnes later told investigators Diehl-Armstrong was the mastermind of the crime and that she wanted the money to pay Barnes to kill her father, who she believed was wasting her inheritance.[5]\nDiehl-Armstrong, Barnes, and Rothstein seem to have had issues with compulsive hoarding.[6][7]\nMarjorie Eleanor \"Marge\" Diehl-Armstrong (February 26, 1949 \u2013 April 4, 2017) had a history of suffering from multiple mental illnesses including bipolar disorder,[6][7] since her early teens,  and seems to have been a serial killer.[8] Before her mental health deteriorated in her twenties, Diehl-Armstrong was an \"exemplary student\" in high school and earned a master's degree from Gannon College.[6][9] In 1984, she shot her boyfriend Robert Thomas six times as he lay on the couch but was acquitted on claims of self-defense.[6][10]  Her husband and several other partners also died under suspicious circumstances.[11] Diehl-Armstrong died from breast cancer in prison on April 4, 2017, at the age of 68.[12][6]\nKenneth Barnes (1954 \u2013 June 20, 2019) was a retired television repairman, crack dealer, and Diehl-Armstrong's \"fishing buddy\". He suffered from diabetes and died in prison on June 20, 2019, at the age of 64\u201365.[13]\nWilliam Ansel \"Bill\" Rothstein (January 17, 1944  \u2013 July 30, 2004) dated Diehl-Armstrong in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was implicated in a 1977 murder after he gave a handgun to a friend who used it to murder a romantic rival; he later attempted to destroy the weapon but was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony.[14] Rothstein was a handyman and part-time shop teacher, and was part of a group called the \"fractured intellectuals\"; intelligent people who were not well-adjusted.[15] Rothstein was admitted to the Millcreek Community Hospital on July 23, 2004, having previously been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma showing diffuse, large-cell type myeloproliferative lymphoma, and died on July 30 that year at the age of 60.[16][5] Rothstein was the putative creator of the collar bomb.\n",

A letter to his parents made it clear that he hoped to spark a revolution by his actions.[2]\nAfter being identified as a suspect three days after the shooting, Frein was the target of an extensive manhunt before being captured on the night of October 30, 2014, at an abandoned airport 48 days after the attack.[4][5] He was convicted of the ambush in 2017 and sentenced to death.\nEric Matthew Frein was born on May 3, 1983, in New Jersey. He attended Pocono Mountain High School in Pennsylvania, where he was a top scorer on the school's rifle team.[6] Police described Frein as a \"self-taught survivalist\" with a grudge against law enforcement personnel.[7] A report on Frein cited his friends saying that, as an Eagle Scout,[8] he was repudiated by the chief executive officer of the Boy Scouts of America Minsi Trails Council at the time, where Frein had worked.[9]\nFrein attended East Stroudsburg University for one semester.[10][11] He also attended Northampton Community College (the Bethlehem Township campus and the Monroe County campus) as a chemistry major.[12]\nIn 2004, Frein was charged with burglary and grand larceny after he was accused of stealing items from vendors at a World War II reenactment in Odessa, New York. He failed to attend his trial and was arrested in Pennsylvania as a fugitive from justice.[12] In lieu of $5,000 bail, Frein was held for 109 days in a county jail in New York on a felony charge before pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of possession of stolen property to be sentenced to time served and payment of $3,120 restitution.[13][14]\nIn 2008, Frein founded Isto\u010dni Vuk (meaning \"Eastern Wolf\" in Serbo-Croatian language) whose Myspace page[15] pictured Frein engaged in recreational military simulations dressed in an Army of Republika Srpska uniform. Though he reenacted in a variety of roles, Frein preferred to portray Bosnian Serb soldiers. Fellow reenactors believed this was not based on ideology, but the way that the ragtag look of an ex-Yugoslav field jacket stood out from others. Pennsylvania State Police also believe that Frein made several trips to Southeast Europe. The Eastern Wolves were one of several groups competing in \"tacticals\" under the umbrella organization \"Red Alliance\", using replica airsoft rifles with plastic BBs. Frein was viewed as a serious reenactor with a deep knowledge of history; he was meticulous in many details, such as uniforms, but not overly obsessive in others\u2013once even choosing a cheaper Chinese-made replica airsoft rifle over one made in Yugoslavia. Although he looked down on casual participants playing \"cowboys and Indians\", he was nevertheless a joker and could be quite humorous.[14]\nFrein's reenactment landed him several employments in the film industry. He played a non-speaking role in Lustig, a 16-minute anti-Nazi film where he portrayed a German soldier at Auschwitz. In 2009, he gave technical direction in a World War I documentary being made by Jeremiah Hornbaker, who credited him for correcting errors in the set design and later offered him several other jobs that he turned down.[14]\nIn July 2014, Frein told Hornbaker, friends, and parents that he was moving to Delaware to work at a chemical company. Police speculate that he might have taken this time to make the preparations that later would allow him to survive and evade capture.[14]\n",

        "paragraph": "Joseph \"Joey\" Daniel Miller (born September 2, 1964) is an American serial killer who raped and murdered at least five girls and women in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania from 1986 and 1990. In 1993, he was convicted and sentenced to death, but it was later commuted to life imprisonment without a chance of parole.[1]\nMiller was born on September 2, 1964, in a poor Steelton family, with three other brothers and a sister.[2] Early on, he showed signs of an intellectual disability, was a poor learner and suffered from anterograde amnesia, for which he was bullied by his classmates. As a result of his poor academic performance, he dropped out from school after the 4th grade. Both of Joseph's parents were physically and emotionally abusive towards him, which greatly influenced his psycho-emotional state. During this period, he was sexually harassed by his uncle and, under the influence of his older brother, began to commit petty thefts and drank alcohol. His father was accused of incest, after Joseph's older sister, at the age of 15, gave birth to a daughter in 1970, telling police that her own father was the child's father as well, who had sexually abused her for two years. Although she went to the police, she received death threats from her mother and other relatives, due to which she ran away from home. Her testimony was questioned, and thus, Joseph's father was ultimately not charged. In 1976, at the age of 12, Miller was severely beaten by a group of peers during a street fight, after which he took a shotgun from his father, tracked down the offenders and shot at them, wounding the teenagers. He was quickly apprehended, convicted and sent to an institution for juvenile delinquents. While in custody, Joseph was sexually assaulted by fellow inmates and beaten by the overseers on several occasions, which led to him developing PTSD-like symptoms. He was released in the early 1980s, but soon began to commit crimes again, in addition to using drugs. At one point, he suffered a near-fatal drug overdose, and was arrested several times for theft, assault, arson  and illegal firearms possession. In 1984, Miller left Steelton and moved to Harrisburg, where he found housing and married a girl who bore him three children from 1985 to 1993. Due to his lack of education, he had to engage in low-skilled labor, and often changed jobs during this time.[2]\nOn August 5, 1992, Miller, together with a friend, visited a bar in Harrisburg, where he met a black girl named Clara Johnson, offering to give her a lift home. Johnson agreed to Miller's proposal, on the condition that his friend was with them during the trip. After all of them got in, Miller, despite his passenger's protests, dropped the friend off and went to the outskirts of the city, where he and Johnson began fighting in a vacant lot near some train tracks, where he beat her, tied her up and raped her twice. After the second rape, he tortured her, dragged the victim to a nearby ditch, where he had planned to kill her and dump the body. At that moment, a patrol car arrived at the scene after being informed that someone had been trespassing. Miller fled the scene, leaving Johnson and his car behind. The officers located her soon after, and after searching through Miller's car, they found a lot of evidence that incriminated him in kidnapping, rape and attempted murder. After establishing his identity, he was put on a wanted list as a fugitive. The next day, he was discovered in his home city of Steelton, where he was hiding in his relatives' house. He resisted the arresting policemen fiercely, releasing himself from their grip and barricading himself on the house's rooftop. He threatened to commit suicide, but after a 6-hour long negotiation with police officers, he surrendered himself and was arrested.\nWhile in custody, he renounced his Miranda rights and soon after, confessed to the murders of two girls. According to his testimony, on May 15, 1987, he got a group of young girls in his car, and after all but one of the passengers left the car, Miller attacked the remaining girl, 18-year-old Celina Franklin, whom he raped and strangled. On November 6, 1989, Miller offered 23-year-old Harrisburg resident Stephanie McDuffie a ride home. After she got into his car, Miller beat her and took the victim to the city's outskirts, where he raped and strangled her as well. To support his claims, he showed the investigators the burial sites on a map, and their bodies were subsequently discovered in mid-August 1992. A few weeks after that, he confessed to the murder of 25-year-old Janette Thompson, who went missing on January 8, 1990; her naked corpse was found only a few days later at a dump. During the investigation, a local named William Kelly, Jr. confessed to the Thompson murder and was convicted, but later on, his lawyers filed an appeal which stated it was a false confession. A forensic psychiatric examination determined that Kelly suffered from an inferiority complex, manic-depressive psychosis and alcoholism, which raised doubts about the legitimacy of his confession. In a new trial, all charges against William Kelly were dropped, and he was released in January 1993.[3] On March 25, 1993, Miller was convicted of killing Celina Franklin and Stephanie McDuffie, as well as the kidnapping and rape of Clara Johnson, for which he was sentenced to death. In subsequent years, Miller's lawyers filed multiple appeals to commute his death sentence, even asking for a new trial, but they were all rejected.[4]\nIn the late 1990s, Joseph confessed to the murder of Kathy Schenk. On February 27, 1990, he picked her up and drove her to Perry County, where he raped and strangled her thereafter. In a follow-up trial, he was convicted of Schenk's killing and received a life imprisonment term.[5]\nIn 2014, thanks to an examination of DNA at the FBI's laboratory in Quantico, the identity of a girl whose remains were discovered in a landfill in February 1997, not far from where Franklin and McDuffie's remains were found, was established. The victim was identified as 26-year-old Kelly Ann Ward, who went missing in February 1986 from Harrisburg. Miller became the prime suspect almost instantly, due to the similarities in Ward's murder and those of his other known victims: the deceased was black, engaged in prostitution, killed with a pipe found near her body, and was disposed of near old car tires and tile pieces, all signs corresponding with Miller's victims.[6]\nIt was only in April 2016 when Miller confessed on tape to the murders of Ward and Janette Thompson. During his testimony, he apologized to the victims' relatives and stated that he wanted to plead guilty, as he was moved by the conversations he had had with the deceased women's relatives. Joseph Miller was charged with Ward and Thompson's murders. Dauphin County prosecutors revealed that although Miller had confessed to the killing way back in 1992, he wasn't charged with it, as he was already on death row.[7] In June of that same year, 24 years later, Miller was returned to Harrisburg to stand trial. On the basis of his confessions, on June 24, 2016, he was found guilty of the murders, and subsequently sentenced to two more life imprisonment terms.[8][9]\nMiller is currently incarcerated in the State Correctional Institution - Camp Hill.[10][11][12]\n",

        "paragraph": "The 1919 Coatesville call to arms was when the black community of Coatesville, Pennsylvania formed a large armed group to prevent a rumoured lynching. Only later when the armed group had surrounded the jail to prevent the lynching did they learn that there was no suspect and no white lynch mob.\nIn 1911, steelworker Zachariah Walker was lynched in Coatesville; he had left his wife and children in Virginia while seeking better work. This African-American man was accused of killing white mill policeman Edgar Rice, a popular figure in town. Walker claimed self-defense and was hospitalized after his arrest.[1] He was dragged from the hospital and burned to death in front of a mob of hundreds in a field south of the city.[2]  Fifteen men and teenage boys were indicted, but all were acquitted at trials. The lynching was the last in Pennsylvania and is said to have left a permanent stain on the city's image.[3]\nOn July 6, 1919, a fourteen-year-old white girl, Esther Hughes, was allegedly attacked by a black man. Esther's boy companion was tied to a tree and another girl that was with Esther was able to run away.[4] On July 8, a rumour surfaced that a suspect had been arrested and that a white mob was assembling to lynch him. Scared by the 1911 lynching of Zachariah Walker a large group of Coatesville's African Americans armed themselves and marched downtown to protect the jail from the white mob. When they arrived Mayor Swing and local Rev. T. W. McKinney assured the crowd that the rumor was false. A number of leaders of the march were arrested and charged with inciting a riot even though they had assembled to stop a rumored white riot.[5] All of the nine people arrested were later released.[5]\nThis uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer, of 1919. The Summer consisted of terrorist attacks on black communities, and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington, D.C. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed. Also occurring in 1919 were the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively, and with both having many more non-fatal injuries and extensive property damage reaching up into the millions of dollars.[6]\nNotes\nReferences\n",

He served from 1965 to 1971 as a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and from 1971 to 1981 as a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate representing the state's 50th district. Dwyer then served as the 30th state treasurer of Pennsylvania from January 20, 1981, to January 22, 1987, when he killed himself during a live press conference.\nIn the early 1980s, Pennsylvania discovered that its state workers had overpaid federal taxes due to errors in state withholding prior to Dwyer's administration. A multi-million-dollar recovery contract was required to determine the compensation to be given to each employee. In 1986, Dwyer was convicted of accepting a bribe from Computer Technology Associates (CTA) to award them the contract. He was found guilty on 11 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, perjury, and interstate transportation in aid of racketeering, and was scheduled to be sentenced on January 23, 1987.[5] On January 22, Dwyer called a news conference in the Pennsylvania State Capitol Building in Harrisburg, during which he fatally shot himself with a .357 Magnum revolver in front of reporters. Dwyer's suicide was broadcast later that day to a wide television audience across Pennsylvania.\nAll posthumous appeals made by Dwyer's lawyers on Dwyer's behalf were denied, and his convictions were upheld.[6][7] Along with Barbara Hafer and Rob McCord, Dwyer is one of three former Pennsylvania State treasurers to be convicted of corruption since the 1980s.[8][9][10]\nR. Budd Dwyer was born on November 21, 1939, in St. Charles, Missouri.[11] He graduated in 1961 with an A.B. in Political Science and Accounting from Allegheny College[11] in Meadville, Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the Beta Chi chapter[12] of Theta Chi Fraternity.[11][13] After earning a master's degree[11] in education[13] in 1963,[11] he taught social studies and coached football[14] at Cambridge Springs High School.[13]\nA Republican, Dwyer became active in politics.[14] He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from the 6th district (although seats were apportioned by county before 1969) in 1964 and was reelected in 1966 and 1968.[15] In 1970, while still a sitting State Representative, Dwyer ran for a seat in the Pennsylvania State Senate from its 50th district and won.[16] Shortly after his victory he resigned his seat in the State House and was sworn in as Senator in January 1971.[16]\nAfter being elected to additional terms in 1974 and 1978,[16] Dwyer decided to try for a statewide office and in 1980 ran for and won the office of Pennsylvania Treasurer[13] that had been held by Robert E. Casey since 1976.[17][18] He ran for a second and last term in 1984 and won reelection to the seat, defeating Democratic nominee and former auditor general Al Benedict.[13]\nFrom 1979 to 1981, before Dwyer was state treasurer, public employees of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania overpaid millions of dollars in Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes (FICA).[13][19] As a result, the state required an accounting firm to determine refunds for its employees.[19] Dwyer awarded the no-bid $4.6 million contract to Computer Technology Associates (CTA), a California-based firm, owned by John Torquato Jr., a native of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on May 10, 1984.[19]\nIn early 1984, Dennis Schatzman, deputy comptroller of Pittsburgh Public Schools, noticed financial discrepancies in the CTA contract, and wrote to Pittsburgh school officials regarding these.[20][21] Schatzman later contacted officials at the accounting firm Arthur Young and Associates, who confirmed that the no-bid CTA contract was overpriced by millions of dollars.[22] In June 1984 the Office of the Pennsylvania Auditor General informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the alleged bribery that occurred during the awarding of the contract.[23] In late July 1984, Janice R. Kincaid, a former CTA employee, released a sworn statement claiming that Dwyer awarded the contract to CTA because he was promised a $300,000 kickback by the company.[24][25]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Collier Township shooting, also referred to as the Bridgeville LA Fitness shooting, was a mass shooting and murder-suicide that took place on August 4, 2009, in an LA Fitness health club in Collier Township, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The attack resulted in four deaths, including that of the perpetrator, who took his own life. Nine other people were injured.[1] The fitness center is approximately 10 miles (16\u00a0km) south of Pittsburgh,[2] in the Great Southern Shopping Center, a strip mall located in the Kirwan Heights section of Collier Township, just outside of the borough of Bridgeville.\nThe shooting occurred at a women's aerobics class at the LA Fitness center at approximately 8:15\u00a0p.m. The shooter entered the class, placed a duffel bag on the ground, turned off the lights, took out two handguns and began firing, police said. According to police, the gunman fired 52 shots with two Glock 9\u00d719mm semiautomatic pistols before committing suicide by shooting himself in the head with a .45-caliber revolver.[1][3] A .32-caliber semiautomatic pistol found in his pocket was not used.[4]\nThree women and the gunman died, and about nine other people were injured. The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's office identified the three women who died as Heidi Overmier, 46, of Collier Township; Elizabeth Gannon, 49, of Green Tree, Pennsylvania; and Jody Billingsley, 38, of Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania.[5]\nGeorge Sodini (September 30, 1960[6] \u2013 August 4, 2009), a 48-year-old systems analyst at the law firm of K&L Gates and a resident of Scott Township, was identified as the perpetrator.[7] He had written about contemplating carrying out a shooting, which he referred to as the \"exit plan\",[3] while also revealing that he \"chickened out\" of carrying out such a shooting earlier in the year. His website states that he was \"never married\" and concludes \"Death Lives!\" Sodini states, \"Probably 99% of the people who know me well don't even think I was this crazy.\" Sodini is reported to have left a note inside the gym bag stating his hatred for women.[5] Nearly a week after the murders, it was revealed that Sodini had brought an inert grenade on a Port Authority bus on July 28, 2009. After a passenger sitting next to him notified police, he was questioned about the incident but no charges were filed.[8]\nOn a website registered in his name,[9] Sodini chronicled over a nine-month period his rejections by women and his severe sexual frustration. \"Who knows why? I am not ugly or too weird. No sex since July 1990 either (I was 29)\", he writes. \"Last time I slept all night with a girlfriend it was 1982. Girls and women don't even give me a second look ANYWHERE\". About his problems with women, he wrote: \"Women just don't like me. There are 30 million desirable women in the US (my estimate) and I cannot find one\". In 2008, Sodini posted online videos, in which he discusses his emotions, along with a tour of his home, the latter which was a homework assignment from \"a self-help seminar [he] had attended on how to date women\".[10]\nTGSCOM Inc., an online gun wholesaler based in Green Bay, Wisconsin, sold Sodini an empty Glock 9\u00a0mm magazine and magazine loading apparatus used in the attack.[11] TGSCOM sold a used handgun to Seung-Hui Cho, who subsequently used it during the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings.[11] TGSCOM also sold an empty magazine and a holster to Steven Kazmierczak, who shot and killed five people at Northern Illinois University in 2008.[11] TGSCOM closed in 2012, having become the subject of investigations by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Wisconsin Better Business Bureau, and Green Bay police.[12]\nOn August 18, it was revealed that Sodini bequeathed his estate, valued at $225,000, to his alma mater the University of Pittsburgh.[13] A spokesperson for the university stated that it had \"no interest in receiving any such distribution\" and requested that it go to the victims and the victims' families.[14]\nIn March 2012, State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. filed a legal motion attempting to preemptively seek exemption from liability under Sodini's $100,000 personal liability policy. Victims of the shooting claim that the insurance company neglected to ensure Sodini got mental health care.[15]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nKermit Barron Gosnell (born February 9, 1941) is an American former physician[2] and serial killer.  He provided abortions at his clinic in West Philadelphia.  Gosnell was convicted of the murders of three infants who were born alive after using drugs to induce birth, was convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of one woman during an abortion procedure, and was convicted of several other medically related crimes.[3][4][5][6][7]\nGosnell, based in the Mantua neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned and operated the Women's Medical Society Clinic, a non-compliant abortion clinic that was dubbed a \"house of horrors\" during the trial.[8] He was a prolific prescriber of OxyContin.[9] In 2011, Gosnell, his wife Pearl, and eight employees were charged with a total of 32 felonies and 227 misdemeanors in connection with deaths, illegal medical services, and regulatory violations. Pearl and the eight employees pleaded guilty to various charges in 2011 while Gosnell pleaded not guilty and sought a jury trial.[10]\nIn May 2013, Gosnell was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of three of the infants and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, an adult patient at the clinic following an abortion procedure. Gosnell was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour informed consent law. After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.[11][12] Gosnell was sentenced to an additional 30 years in prison for federal drug charges.[13]\nGosnell was born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the only child of a gas station operator and a government clerk[14] in an African-American family.[15] He was a student at the city's Central High School from which he graduated in 1959.[16][17] Gosnell initially attended the University of Pennsylvania,[18] then graduated from Dickinson College with a bachelor's degree.[19] He received his medical degree at the Thomas Jefferson University in 1966.[16]\nIt has been reported that Gosnell spent four decades practicing medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and a teen aid program.[16] He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua.[14][20] Gosnell told The Philadelphia Inquirer in October 1972: \"As a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them.\"[21]\nThat same year, Gosnell also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental \"Super Coil\" method invented by Harvey Karman. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. However, complications from the procedure were reported by nine of the women, with three of these reporting severe complications.[22][23]\nThe 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a \"respected man\" in his community, and a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce's \"Young Philadelphian of the Year\" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House.[21] By the late 1980s, however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien.[21]\nGosnell has been married three times. His third and current wife, Pearl, had worked at the Women's Medical Society as a full-time medical assistant from 1982 until their marriage in 1990.[1]  They have two children.[24] Gosnell has four other children from his two previous marriages.[24] In covering his background, media commentators drew attention to the \"incredibly diverse\" portrayals of Gosnell, touching on both his community works \u2013 the creation of the halfway house and teen aid program \u2013 contrasted with portrayals of his practice as an abortion mill in which viable fetuses and babies were routinely killed following illegal late-term procedures.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "Lauretha A. Vaird (August 4, 1952 \u2013 January 2, 1996) was a Philadelphia Police Department officer who was shot dead by the rapper Christopher Roney aka \"Cool C\" during a botched armed bank robbery in January 1996. Roney attempted to rob the bank with another rapper, Warren McGlone aka \"Steady B\", and another man, Mark Canty. During the robbery, Vaird was mortally wounded by a gunshot wound in the abdomen and died soon after. Vaird was Philadelphia's first female police officer to be shot and killed in the line of duty.[2]\nVaird was a single mother of two boys. Before she became a police officer, she worked as a teacher's aide at Pickett Middle School in Germantown. She joined the Philadelphia police force in 1986 at the age of 34.[3] Before her death, she was a 9-year veteran with the 25th District.\nOn January 2, 1996, at around 8:20 a.m., \"Cool C\" and \"Steady B\", and their accomplice, Canty, attempted to rob a PNC Bank branch in Feltonville, Philadelphia, at 4710 Rising Sun Avenue.[4] The men had stolen a green minivan for the job which was driven by McGlone who acted as the getaway driver. Roney and Canty went into the branch before it was due to open. Canty carried a 9 millimeter semi-automatic handgun and Roney was armed with a .38 caliber revolver. The bank had no security guards, which influenced the men to rob that particular branch. They held three bank employees at gunpoint and demanded access to the bank vault. Within moments of entering the bank, the silent alarm was tripped. Officer Vaird, who was in the area at the time and riding alone in a patrol car, responded to the alarm.[5]\nCanty forced two of the bank employees to take him to the vault while Roney stood guard by the bank entrance covering the third employee. As Vaird entered the door to the bank with her weapon drawn, she was shot in the abdomen by Roney. Vaird was wearing a bulletproof vest, but it was without its bullet-resistant panels. After he shot her, Roney left the bank through the front door. Canty fled through a side entrance and left his gun at the scene. Roney then exchanged fire with another police officer, Donald Patterson, who arrived shortly after Vaird. Roney was able to escape and dropped his gun on the sidewalk outside the entrance to the bank. He got into the minivan with McGlone and the two men then fled. None of the three suspects stole anything from the bank.[6] Vaird was taken to St. Christopher's Hospital for Children, where she was pronounced dead at 9:56 am, having been killed by the single shot to the abdomen.[7]\nThe two pistols used by the assailants were found separately outside different entrances to the bank. The stolen minivan that Roney and McGlone had escaped in was found abandoned about a mile from the bank. The police also found various items of clothing used as disguises by Canty and Roney. This evidence led to their warrants and arrests. The guns were traced back to both Canty and McGlone.[6] The .38 caliber revolver used by Roney belonged to Anthony Brown, a relative of Canty. It had been stolen from Brown and was last seen in Canty's possession before the bank robbery. The 9mm semi-automatic pistol was traced back to Richelle Parker, a friend of McGlone, who had bought the gun for him.[5]\nMcGlone was arrested outside his home two days later on January 4, 1996. He was charged with murder in the death of officer Vaird. After questioning McGlone, police issued a warrant for the arrests of Canty and Roney. Canty was arrested during a traffic stop in Maryland at a later date.[1] Roney surrendered to the police on January 6, 1996.[6]\nVaird died at the age of 43 and is buried at Ivy Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nOn October 30, 1996, McGlone and Canty were both sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.[4] McGlone is an inmate at the State Correctional Institution \u2013 Houtzdale and his inmate ID number is DD6864.[8] Canty is an inmate at the State Correctional Institution \u2013 Mahanoy and his inmate ID number is DD6842.[8] Roney was identified as the actual killer of Vaird, as he had been the one to fire the gun that killed her. On October 30, 1996, Roney was found guilty of first-degree murder, three counts of robbery, conspiracy, aggravated assault, burglary and possession of an instrument of crime.[5] On November 1, 1996, he received the death penalty for murdering Vaird.[9] He is currently on death row awaiting execution and is an inmate at the State Correctional Institution \u2013 Greene.[10] His inmate ID number is DF1973.[8]\nOn January 10, 2006, Roney's death warrant was signed by Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell and his execution date was set for March 9, 2006 (Rendell was Philadelphia's Mayor at the time of the robbery/murder).[9] He was granted a stay of execution from Pennsylvania Judge Gary Glazer on February 1, 2006, until all post-conviction litigation was resolved.[11] His execution was set for January 8, 2015,[12] but he was granted another stay of execution by Pennsylvania Judge Luis Felipe Restrepo on December 5, 2014.[13]\n",

He made his first high-profile appearance with his 2016 breakout single, \"Elm Street\", produced by Stvii B, which Complex included in the \"'Bout to Blow: 10 Dope New Songs You Should Be Hearing Everywhere Soon\" list.[1] Following that success, he collaborated with several prominent rappers including Wiz Khalifa, Sonny Digital, 21 Savage and more.[2] After receiving a co-sign from hip hop producer Mike Will Made It, rap duo Rae Sremmurd brought Wopo out to perform during their set at the Pittsburgh stop of their SremmLife 2 Tour.[3] Wopo was murdered in a drive-by shooting on June 18, 2018.\nIn January 2015, Wopo began uploading original tracks to his SoundCloud account. Taylor Maglin, the owner of the Pittsburgh-based blog Daily Loud, partnered with him and began to publicize his music. This additional push helped him to accumulate millions of views on his music videos on his YouTube channel.[4] Joining the wave of Wopo's viral success, urban hip hop blog WorldStarHipHop exclusively debuted five of his music videos in 2016.[5] On July 24, 2016, he premiered his debut project, Woponese, on Daily Loud.[6] This 8-track mixtape included the single \"Back Door\", which features Sonny Digital.[7] In October 2016, Riff Raff tapped Wopo for a feature on the track \"Stay Away from You\" on his Balloween mixtape.[8] On November 25, 2016, he released a joint album with his fellow Pittsburgh-based rapper Hardo. This nine-track project featured ShadyHigler, 21 Savage and Wiz Khalifa.[9]\nAs many as fifty completed, unreleased songs will be released posthumously, according to Wopo's manager.[10]\nOn February 7, 2016, Wopo was arrested during a traffic stop in Washington County, Pennsylvania. Police arrested Wopo and two others after finding two stamp bags of suspected heroin and a small amount of marijuana.

        "paragraph": "Joseph Albert \"Jock\" Yablonski (March 3, 1910 \u2013 December 31, 1969) was an American labor leader in the United Mine Workers in the 1950s and 1960s known for seeking reform in the union and better working conditions for miners. In 1969 he challenged Tony Boyle for the presidency of the international union and was defeated. He asked for a Department of Labor (DOL) investigation, charging a fraudulent election. In addition, Yablonski filed suit against the UMWA on five different charges related to fraud. On New Year's Eve, Yablonski, his wife and 25-year-old daughter were murdered, fatally shot at home by three gunmen found to have been hired on orders of Tony Boyle.\nA total of seven persons were convicted of murder and conspiracy to commit murder; two of the assassins were sentenced to death for first-degree murder. DOL completed its investigation, aided by the FBI, and won a suit to overturn the 1969 election by 1972. A new election was held in December of that year and a reform candidate elected, defeating Boyle. Boyle was indicted in 1973 for the three Yablonski murders; he was convicted in 1974 and received three life sentences. The union made important reforms.[citation needed]\nJoseph Yablonski, called \"Jock\", was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on March 3, 1910, as the son of Polish immigrants,[1] After attending public schools, Yablonski began working in the mines as a boy, joining his father in this industry.\nAfter his father was killed in a mine explosion, Yablonski became active in the United Mine Workers and began to advocate for better working conditions. He was first elected to union office in 1934. In 1940, Yablonski was elected as a representative to the international executive board. In 1958 he was appointed president of UMW District 5.[2]\nAs a young man, Yablonski married Ann Marie\u00a0Huffman (November 5, 1913 \u2013 September 28, 2003). Their son Kenneth J. Yablonski was born in 1934. Yablonski married again, to Margaret Rita Wasicek (August 8, 1912 \u2013 December 31, 1969), an amateur playwright. They had two children, Joseph \"Chip\" (b. 1941) and Charlotte Yablonski, b. 1944. Both sons became labor attorneys, representing their father in his union activities and later in private practices. Charlotte became a social worker in Clarksville, Pennsylvania, where her family lived. She took leave to work in 1969 on her father's campaign for the UMWA presidency.[2]\nYablonski clashed with Tony Boyle, who was elected president of the UMW in 1963, over how the union should be run. He believed that Boyle did not adequately represent the miners and was too cozy with the mine owners. In 1965, Boyle removed Yablonski as president of District 5 (under changes enacted by Boyle, district presidents were appointed by him, rather than being elected by union members of their district, giving him more control.[2]\nIn May 1969, Yablonski announced his candidacy for president of the union in the election to be held later that year. As early as June, Boyle was reportedly discussing the need to kill his opponent.[2]\nThe United Mine Workers was in turmoil by 1969.  Legendary UMWA president John L. Lewis had retired in 1960. His successor, Thomas Kennedy, died in 1963. From retirement, Lewis hand-picked Boyle for the UMWA presidency. A Montana miner, Boyle was as autocratic and bullying as Lewis, but not as well liked.[3][4]\nFrom the beginning of his administration, Boyle faced significant opposition from rank-and-file miners and UMWA leaders. Miners' attitudes about their union had also changed. Miners wanted greater democracy and more autonomy for their local unions.  There was also a widespread belief that Boyle was more concerned with protecting mine owners' interests than those of his members.  Grievances filed by the union often took months\u2014sometimes years\u2014to resolve, lending credence to the critics' claim. Wildcat strikes occurred as local unions, despairing of UMWA assistance, sought to resolve local disputes with walkouts.[3][4][5]\n",

The attack was motivated by antisemitic hate.\nNeal Rosenblum was the third of five children in an Orthodox Jewish family in Toronto, Canada. He was a rabbinical and computer science student. He married Manya Weingarten of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh in the spring of 1985.[1] As a devout Orthodox Jew, he prayed three times daily, attending services at synagogue or at Jewish schools.[2]\nA month after their daughter was born, the family visited Mrs. Rosenblum's parents, intending to stay for Passover.[1]\nRosenblum was 24[3] or 25[2] years old at the time.[4]\nA few hours after arriving at his in-laws' house in Squirrel Hill, Rosenblum went to pray the evening services at the Kollel Bais Yitzchok Torah Institute Study Center.[3] As he walked home from the synagogue, a car pulled up, and the passenger engaged him in conversation. The passenger then shot him five times.[5][6] He was killed because of his Jewish appearance, wearing Haredi attire such as a black fedora.[7]\nRosenblum was still conscious when emergency workers arrived, and he provided some details of the attack. He died about five hours later while in surgery at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.[1]\nInvestigators were unable to develop leads for 12 years.\nIn 1988, Tielsch and Sanford Gordon shared a cell in the Allegheny County jail, both on separate drug charges. Tielsch bragged that he had killed a Jew, and would often make antisemitic remarks and draw swastikas, a common antisemitic symbol, on himself. Gordon reported the information to the authorities, but they did not have enough evidence to make the case in 2000.[8][9] At that time, the Cold Case Squad took over the investigation and got a corroborating witness. Twelve years after the original crime, police arrested the now 45-year-old killer.[2]\nGordon was the star witness in all the trials. In the first three trials, an extensive roster of witnesses was used, many of them jailhouse informants or otherwise unsavory characters. For the fourth trial, the prosecutor streamlined the case, using more technologically advanced presentation such as PowerPoint and far fewer witnessess, concluding the proceedings in half the amount of time.[2]\n",

A former Camp Hill prison guard, Banks fatally shot 13 people on September 25, 1982, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and Jenkins Township.  The victims included seven children \u2013 five being his own \u2013 their mothers, some of their relatives, and one bystander.[1] It is the deadliest mass shooting in Pennsylvania's history.[2]\nHis attorneys argued for the insanity defense, but, following a trial before jurors from Allegheny County and presided over by Luzerne County Common Pleas judge Patrick J. Toole Jr., Banks was convicted of 12 counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.[3]\nOn November 29, 1990, the Pennsylvania State Legislature barred further use of the electric chair amid debate that electrocution was cruel and unusual punishment; it approved execution by lethal injection. Banks's case was appealed and, on December 2, 2004, he received a stay of execution following a determination that he was incompetent for execution. On May 12, 2010, Luzerne County Common Pleas judge Joseph Augello declared Banks incompetent to be executed, following a competency hearing held the previous month.[4]\nOn the night of September 24, 1982, Banks drank large quantities of straight gin and took prescription drugs at his home on Schoolhouse Lane in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.[5]  The next morning on September 25, 1982, he used an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to kill eight people in his house, including three women in their 20s (all girlfriends and mothers of his children) and five children, four of them his. Two of the women were sisters.[6] Banks dressed in military fatigues and went outside, where he saw 22-year-old Jimmy Olsen and 24-year-old Ray Hall, Jr, leaving a house across the street. He shot them both, reportedly yelling that they \"would not tell anyone about this\" before firing. He hit both men, fatally wounding Hall; Olsen survived. Banks drove away.\nBanks went to Heather Highlands mobile home park, where his former girlfriend Sharon Mazzillo and their son Kissamayu lived, of whom he had been trying to gain custody. Banks forced his way in and shot Mazzillo. He then shot and killed his sleeping son. Banks killed Sharon\u2019s mother, who was trying to call the police, and Sharon's 7-year-old nephew, who was also in the home. Sharon\u2019s brother hid in the closet, whom Banks did not see. He was the only survivor and called the police, identifying Banks as the shooter.[citation needed]\nWhen police examined the victims at the mobile home park, they connected it to Olsen and Hall's shooting, which had been discovered at Schoolhouse Lane. They next found Banks's victims in his house. Police began to search for Banks, who abandoned his car and carjacked another vehicle. After abandoning the stolen vehicle, Banks stopped in an isolated grassy area to rest and fell asleep.[citation needed]\nAfter Banks awoke, he visited his mother's house (also in Wilkes-Barre.) He was said to confess his crimes to her. She drove him to the house of Jacob Whitt, a friend of Banks, where he sent her away and prepared for a standoff with police.[7]\nA standoff between Banks and police began. The police brought his mother to their base to talk with Banks. They tried various tactics to get the murderer to surrender, including having a false news report played over WILK radio saying that the children were alive and needed blood to survive. The police tried other tactics to draw Banks out of the house. Finally, Robert Brunson, a former co-worker of Banks, was able to talk him out after a 4-hour standoff.[8] As of September 30, 1982, Banks was charged with eight counts of murder, attempted murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangerment, grand theft auto, armed robbery, and felonious theft. Banks was held without bail.[9]\n[10]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nCharles Edmund Cullen (born February 22, 1960) is an American serial killer. Cullen, a nurse, murdered dozens \u2013 possibly hundreds \u2013 of patients during a 16-year career spanning several New Jersey medical centers, until being arrested in 2003. He confessed to committing as many as 40 murders,[1][2] at least 29 of which have been confirmed,[1] though interviews with police, psychiatrists and journalists[3] suggest he committed many more.[4]\nCharles Cullen was born on February 22, 1960, in West Orange, New Jersey. He was raised in a working-class Catholic family, the youngest of eight children.[5] His father Edmond, a bus driver, died on September 17, 1960, when Charles was seven months old.[5] Cullen later described his childhood as \"miserable\" and claimed to have been constantly bullied by his schoolmates and sisters' boyfriends. When he was aged nine, he made the first of many suicide attempts by drinking chemicals from a chemistry set.\nCullen's mother, Florence Cullen (n\u00e9e Ward), was born in England and emigrated to the US after World War II. She was killed in a car accident on December 6, 1977, at the age of 55, when Cullen was in his senior year of high school.[5] Cullen recalled his mother's death as being \"devastating\" and described being upset that the hospital did not immediately inform him of her death and cremated her body instead of returning it.\nThe following year, Cullen graduated from West Orange High School and enlisted in the United States Navy.[6] He served aboard the submarine USS Woodrow Wilson. He successfully passed basic training and the rigorous psychological examinations required for submarine crews, who were expected to spend as long as two months at a time being submerged in a cramped vessel. Cullen rose to the rank of petty officer second class as part of the team that operated the vessel's Poseidon missiles. He did not fit in during his time in the Navy and was hazed and bullied by his fellow crewmen.\nA year into his service, Cullen's leading petty officer aboard Woodrow Wilson discovered him seated at the missile controls wearing a surgical mask, gloves and scrubs rather than his uniform.[5] Cullen was disciplined for that action but never explained why he had dressed that way. The Navy reassigned Cullen to a lower-pressure job on the supply ship USS Canopus. He attempted suicide and was committed to the Navy psychiatric ward several times over the subsequent few years. Cullen received a medical discharge from the Navy in 1984 for undisclosed reasons.[5]\nShortly after his discharge, Cullen enrolled at Mountainside Hospital's nursing school in Montclair, New Jersey. Elected president of his nursing class, he graduated in 1986 and started work at the burn unit of Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey.[7]\nMeanwhile, Cullen met and married Adrianne Baum in 1987.[5] Their daughter, the first of two girls, was born later that year. However, Cullen's wife became increasingly disturbed at his unusual behavior and his abuse of the family dogs.[5] In 1993, she filed a restraining order against him based on her fear that he might endanger her and their two children. She claimed that Cullen had spiked people's drinks with lighter fluid, burned his daughter's books, and left his daughters with a babysitter for a week. Cullen denied these claims, saying that his wife was exaggerating. Nevertheless, she continued to insist that Cullen was mentally ill.\nThe first murders to which Cullen later confessed occurred at Saint Barnabas. On June 11, 1988, he administered a lethal overdose of intravenous medication to a patient.[8] Cullen eventually admitted to killing several other patients at Saint Barnabas, including an AIDS patient who died after he had been given an overdose of insulin.[4] Cullen left Saint Barnabas in January 1992 when the hospital authorities began investigating the contaminated IV bags. The investigation later determined that Cullen had most likely been responsible, resulting in dozens of patient deaths at the hospital.[4]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Jordan Brown case involves Jordan Brown (born August 12, 1997), who was initially charged at 11 as an adult in the fatal shooting of his father's fianc\u00e9e, Kenzie Marie Houk, 26, in New Beaver, Pennsylvania, which occurred on the morning of February 20, 2009. Jordan was interviewed by Pennsylvania State Police twice that day and arrested before sunrise the next morning. The Lawrence County District Attorney's Office initially filed the charges in adult court because that is required in Pennsylvania homicide cases, regardless of a defendant's age. The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office then took over prosecution of the case. After Brown had spent more than three years in a juvenile detention facility in Erie, Pennsylvania, while Pennsylvania courts deliberated his status, Brown was tried as a juvenile and found guilty of being delinquent by a judge on April 13, 2012.\nOn May 8, 2013, the Superior Court vacated the finding of delinquency, citing \"palpable abuse of discretion\" and sent the case back to juvenile court. On July 18, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court overturned his conviction in a 5\u20130 decision. The justices attacked the evidence as insufficient and said that the juvenile trial evidence pointing to a shotgun in Brown's bedroom as the murder weapon supported an equally-reasonable conclusion that it was not the murder weapon.[1]\nBrown could have faced a life sentence without parole if he had been tried and convicted for murder as an adult, but he faced custody in a secure juvenile detention center until he reached the age of 21 because he was only 11 when the crime occurred. He was granted transfer of his case into the juvenile court system. Under Pennsylvania Law, those who are under 15 and being tried as an adult are sentenced to life with parole after 25 years.\nKenzie Houk was eight months pregnant when she was shot in the back of the head while she was sleeping in bed in their western Pennsylvania farmhouse. Both she and her unborn son died as a result of the attack. Houk's 4-year-old daughter alerted nearby tree cutters roughly 45 minutes after Jordan Brown and Houk's 7-year-old daughter got on a school bus. The state Attorney General prosecutor asserted that Houk was killed by a youth-model Harrington & Richardson 20-gauge shotgun, a Christmas gift to Jordan from his father. Pennsylvania State Police found a spent shotgun shell near the path Brown walked with Houk's older daughter to get to their school bus.[2][3] He was subsequently arrested.\nThe human-rights organization Amnesty International opposed the effort to try Jordan as an adult, citing the mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole penalty as a violation of international law.[4] A petition signed by nearly 4,000 people protested what it termed as denial of Brown's fifth and sixth amendment rights.\nOn weekends Jordan hunted alongside his father, Chris Brown, who purchased the youth-sized 20-gauge shotgun that state police believed was the murder weapon. The youth's father did not publicly discuss the case, until after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court exonerated his son nine years later in July 2018.[5]\nJordan Brown was initially charged as an adult. Presiding Judge Dominick Motto of the Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, Common Pleas Court initially denied decertification and transfer to juvenile court because Jordan would not admit his involvement in the crime. After Pennsylvania's Superior Court ruled that Judge Motto violated Brown's Fifth Amendment rights, Judge Motto recused himself from the case, and Judge John W. Hodge granted the decertification petition and ruled that Brown should be tried as a juvenile.[6]\nThe decertification ruling transferred Brown's case from adult court to Lawrence County's family court division regularly presided over by Judge Hodge, who handled the subsequent juvenile adjudication and dispositional hearings.\nThen the issue became whether Brown's eventual adjudication hearing (juvenile court trial) should be opened to the public, and whether he should provisionally be released while a decision in that matter was pending.[7][8][9][10] Judge Hodge held that Brown's juvenile hearing would not be open to the public or to the news media. The Pennsylvania Superior Court rejected an appeal by three area newspapers (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and New Castle News) to overturn Hodge's ruling and open the hearing to the public.[11] After those newspapers decided not to pursue their appeal further, Judge Hodge was directed by another panel of the Superior Court to move swiftly to hold an adjudication hearing. Judge Hodge ruled that Jordan would not be released pending that hearing.\n",

Andrew Jerome Wurst, 14, fatally shot 48-year-old John Gillette, and wounded another teacher and two students[1] at Nick's Place (a nearby banquet hall)[2] during an 8th grade dinner dance.[3]\nPrior to the shooting, Andrew Wurst was described as an average student and somewhat of a loner. One student noticed that he had become curt and unfriendly prior to the shooting, and had told others that he wanted to \"kill people and commit suicide\". He was later sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.[4] He had no diagnosis of mental illness prior to the shooting.\nWurst showed up late to the dance, with his father's .25-caliber pistol in a holster belt under his jacket. He had previously left a suicide note under his pillow, and stated to investigators that he planned to go to the dance and kill only himself.[5]\nThe shooting began on an outdoor patio, about twenty minutes before the dance was scheduled to end, around 21:40. He shot John Gillette after he asked Wurst to come inside. Before running out of ammunition, Wurst proceeded to enter Nick's Place, where the dance had been held, and subsequently fired and wounded Edrye Boraten, a teacher and two students, Jacob Tury and Robert Zemcheck.[1] The shooting ended when the owner of Nick's Place, James Strand, intervened and confronted Wurst with his shotgun, ordering him to drop his weapon and later holding him at bay for eleven minutes.  Strand later got Wurst on the ground and searched him for weapons, finding a dinner fork in his sock.[6]\nWurst was psychotic. At some points, he seems to have thought that everyone was a zombie, already dead. At other times, he said that he was the only real person in the world, with \"unreal\" people activated only in his presence. He also claimed he was an alien from another planet, brought to earth as an infant. At school, he sometimes referred to himself as \"your god, Satan.\" He had a number of developmental difficulties, reportedly being a bed-wetter as late as age nine. Even at age fourteen he feared monsters in his closet.  At school, he wrote stories and made video accounts of fictional murders and suicide.\"[7]\nHis attack was planned; he attempted to recruit another student to help with the massacre. He mentioned his scheme to other students days before the shooting. He took the gun, stuck it in his waistband, and left a suicide note as he left home. At the party, he showed the gun to his classmates, none of whom reported it to an adult.\"[7]\nWurst's attorneys had considered an insanity defense, but recommended that he pled guilty because it would be hard to convince the jury of an insanity defense.\nWurst was charged with attempted murder, third-degree murder, and first-degree murder, and pleaded guilty in a plea bargain to a lesser charge of third-degree murder along with attempted murder to avoid going to trial, and in an attempt to avoid life imprisonment. He is serving a 30 to 60-year sentence in the State Correctional Institution \u2013 Forest. He will be eligible for parole in 2029.\n",

        "paragraph": "The 39th District Corruption Scandal refers to a persistent pattern of brutality and corruption among a cadre of Philadelphia Police Department officers, primarily from the Department's 39th District. The scandal emerged in late 1995 and received nationwide attention by 1997, eventually resulting in an investigation by Human Rights Watch. Hundreds of people were involved in the incidents that occurred in North Philadelphia in the early 1990s.  Some individuals are notable due to their direct participation, and others for their participation in related events, particularly the legal proceedings of the conviction of Mumia Abu-Jamal for the murder of Officer Daniel Faulkner.\nAccording to the Washington Post, police brutality within the district was \"particularly present under the leadership of Frank Rizzo\", and the district had \"a long history of periodic scandals and corruption cases, as well as a reputation for police brutality.\"[1] The core of the scandal involved actions by a group of Philadelphia police officers, some of whom were known to North Philadelphia as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. These officers were charged with investigating suspected crack houses and drug distribution hubs.  The officers conducted \"raids\" which were often unreported. In some of these locations the officers were also known for stealing from suspects and were described by one of the prosecuting judges as \"squash[ing] the Bill of Rights into the mud.\".[2]\nThree of the involved officers were dismissed from the department in 1991 for searching a known drug dealer's suburban apartment without a warrant. This dismissal was based on information provided by Pamela Jenkins, a prostitute and drug user who was the longtime girlfriend and informant of Officer Thomas Ryan. One of the dismissed officers, Sergeant Thomas Degovanni, was reinstated a year later, while another officer, John Baird, was in arbitration for reinstatement. The third dismissed officer, Thomas Ryan, was awarded a full disability pension by the city board of pensions.\nThe investigation into the illegal search was ultimately turned over to the FBI by the Philadelphia Police Department Internal Affairs Bureau at the direction of Police Commissioner Willie Williams, in the wake of the beating of Rodney King by the Los Angeles Police Department. Many high-ranking command officers saw this as a political move on the part of Commissioner Williams, who then actively campaigned for the position of Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.[citation needed]\nThe FBI carried the investigation as a low priority, assigning it to a rookie agent, James Williamson, as the first criminal investigation he headed. Williamson's investigation was stalled with no reliable witnesses or evidence to indict the 39th District, 5 Squad officers until Philadelphia Police Detective, James Dambach, was detailed to the FBI to assist Agent Williamson. By the summer of 1994 they had acquired enough circumstantial evidence of civil rights violations to approach former officer Thomas Ryan.\nRyan agreed to cooperate and turned over his informant and lover Pamela Jenkins to Detective Dambach and Agent Williamson. Ryan and Jenkins both agreed to wear body wires and to record their conversations with former officer Baird. In December 1994, Detective Dambach and Agent Williamson confronted Baird with the recordings made by Ryan and Jenkins. Baird, facing a long prison sentence if convicted, agreed to cooperate but was eventually charged and pled guilty to obstruction of justice for lying to a federal agent in a failed attempt to steer the investigation away from specific police officers who the Feds had targeted for indictment.\nThe federal investigation of the Philadelphia Police eventually expanded into the elite Highway Patrol Unit when Officer James Ryan (unrelated to Thomas Ryan) agreed to cooperate against the officers in that unit who engaged in the same activities as the officers in the 39th District.\nIn the wake of the scandal, nearly 1,400 cases were put under review; by 1997, between 160 and 300 had been overturned, leading to the release of more than 100 persons.  Beyond the convictions obtained by federal prosecutors, no one in the Philadelphia Police Detective was explicitly punished, other than being transferred to other units within the department, with the exception of Philadelphia Police Detective James Dambach, who upon returning to regular police duties found himself to be a pariah within the ranks. Labelled a \"Gink\" (Philadelphia police term for rat), Dambach endured the label and eventually attained the rank of lieutenant.\nThe following members of the Philadelphia Police Detective's Special Narcotics Unit, also known as The Five Squad, were convicted:\n",

Workers were often denouncing their working conditions and the fight for a ten hour day was prominent here. The 1848 strike was a response to relaxed laws following the 1845 strike despite agreements made in 1845. Both were led by women and children because they made up the majority of the textile workforce.The Allegheny Textile Strike of 1845 began on September 15 at the Market House, in what is now known as the North Side in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. More than 400 textile workers awaited an update on their push for a ten hour day, as opposed to 12, without a pay cut.[3] The strike began over textile workers, primarily women and children, fighting for a ten hour day without a pay cut from their typical 12-hour day.[4] Civic leaders and property owners were worried about the gender norms being rejected but also that potential investors would not invest in the city anymore; they also feared the challenging idea of class harmony, and the challenging of capitalist values.[5]\nThe Allegheny Textile Strike was a peaceful strike until October 7, 1845. On that day, an uprising took place and challenged gender norms in the way women behaved in strikes and protests. Women strikers began mudslinging and using axes to break down the fences surrounding factories.[6] These actions aimed at scaring away scabs that took their place in the factories. The actions carried out by women during the Allegheny Textile Strikes challenged the gender norms of the time and influenced an important part of the population to no longer support the 10-hour work day.\nThe strike of 1845 was only partially successful, with a law being passed limiting the working day to 10 hours but with provision that a contract could be signed by workers making them work 12.[7]\nOn October 13, 1845, civic leaders attempted to write to factory owners and convince them to change the industry's standards to 10-hour work days but they were unsuccessful in this effort.[8] It wasn't until mid-october that factories were reopened with about half of their normal number of workers.[8] In March 1848, a law was finally passed for the 10-hour workday; however, a provision allowed for special contracts of a twelve-hour day.[7] This caused another strike in the textile industry that mirrored the 1845 strike.[8]\n",

Gosnell was convicted of the murders of three infants who were born alive after using drugs to induce birth, was convicted of manslaughter in connection with the death of one woman during an abortion procedure, and was convicted of several other medically related crimes.[3][4][5][6][7]\nGosnell, based in the Mantua neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned and operated the Women's Medical Society Clinic, a non-compliant abortion clinic that was dubbed a \"house of horrors\" during the trial.[8] He was a prolific prescriber of OxyContin.[9] In 2011, Gosnell, his wife Pearl, and eight employees were charged with a total of 32 felonies and 227 misdemeanors in connection with deaths, illegal medical services, and regulatory violations. Pearl and the eight employees pleaded guilty to various charges in 2011 while Gosnell pleaded not guilty and sought a jury trial.[10]\nIn May 2013, Gosnell was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of three of the infants and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, an adult patient at the clinic following an abortion procedure. Gosnell was also convicted of 21 felony counts of illegal late-term abortion, and 211 counts of violating Pennsylvania's 24-hour informed consent law. After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.[11][12] Gosnell was sentenced to an additional 30 years in prison for federal drug charges.[13]\nGosnell was born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the only child of a gas station operator and a government clerk[14] in an African-American family.[15] He was a student at the city's Central High School from which he graduated in 1959.[16][17] Gosnell initially attended the University of Pennsylvania,[18] then graduated from Dickinson College with a bachelor's degree.[19] He received his medical degree at the Thomas Jefferson University in 1966.[16]\nIt has been reported that Gosnell spent four decades practicing medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and a teen aid program.[16] He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua.[14][20] Gosnell told The Philadelphia Inquirer in October 1972: \"As a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them.\"[21]\nThat same year, Gosnell also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental \"Super Coil\" method invented by Harvey Karman. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. However, complications from the procedure were reported by nine of the women, with three of these reporting severe complications.[22][23]\nThe 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a \"respected man\" in his community, and a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce's \"Young Philadelphian of the Year\" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House.[21] By the late 1980s, however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien.[21]\nGosnell has been married three times. His third and current wife, Pearl, had worked at the Women's Medical Society as a full-time medical assistant from 1982 until their marriage in 1990.[1]  They have two children.[24] Gosnell has four other children from his two previous marriages.[24] In covering his background, media commentators drew attention to the \"incredibly diverse\" portrayals of Gosnell, touching on both his community works \u2013 the creation of the halfway house and teen aid program \u2013 contrasted with portrayals of his practice as an abortion mill in which viable fetuses and babies were routinely killed following illegal late-term procedures.[16]\n",

        "paragraph": "Tyrone Everett (April 18, 1953 \u2013 May 26, 1977) was a professional boxer from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. He was a top-rated contender in the junior lightweight division during the 1970s. His best known fight is a controversial decision loss to World Boxing Council Junior Lightweight Champion Alfredo Escalera on November 30, 1976. Everett was killed by his girlfriend on May 26, 1977, after she found him with a transvestite.\nIn his early teens, Everett was inspired to start boxing after a kid who lived across the street from the Everett home showed him a boxing trophy he had won. Everett briefly quit after losing an amateur bout to Jerome Artis, but Jimmy Arthur, who trained Everett, convinced him to return to the gym.[1]\nKnown as \"The Mean Machine,\" Everett was a sublimely skilled southpaw. The Associated Press called him \"a classic boxer, using the ropes, deceptive power and skillful counter-punching.\" In the book Philadelphia's Boxing Heritage 1876-1976, the authors stated that Everett \"could do everything that champion Pernell Whitaker could do, and Everett was a harder puncher.\"[2]\nEverett turned professional in 1971 and eventually made enough money to buy a bar, two apartment houses and a Cadillac. \"Money is the only reason I'm fighting,\" he once said. \"Man, you gotta be out of your mind to say you like to fight. Who wants to get in the ring and get beat up?\"\nHe also dreamed of winning a world title. \"I see myself coming into the ring. I have the championship belt around my waist ... and the lights go down, and the spotlight hits me. I hear all the girls in the audience screaming, 'Whoo-eee, look at Tyrone Everett.' How can I lose with all these girls screaming at me?\" Everett said.[3]\nOn November 30, 1976, Everett challenged Alfredo Escalera for the World Boxing Council Junior Lightweight Championship at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. After fifteen rounds, Escalara was awarded a highly controversial split decision victory over the slick southpaw. Tom Cushman of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote:\nVeteran boxing judge Harold Lederman listed the verdict as the most controversial decision of all-time. He said it \"may be history's worst decision.\"[5]\nAt the time of Everett's death, he was scheduled to have a rematch with Escalera in Puerto Rico in June 1977.\nEverett, who had a professional record was 36-1 with 20 knockouts, was inducted into the Pennsylvania Boxing Hall of Fame in 2006.[6][7]\n",

        "paragraph": "Morris Charles Rath (December 25, 1887 \u2013 November 18, 1945) was an American baseball player. He played second base in Major League Baseball for the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Naps, Chicago White Sox, and Cincinnati Reds.  Rath was the batter hit by Eddie Cicotte in the 1919 World Series as Cicotte's signal to gamblers that the \"fix was on\" in that series. In an era before on-base percentage was a valued statistic, Rath was known for his ability to get on base by drawing bases on balls. His name was sometimes reported as Maurice Rath.\nBorn in Mobeetie, Texas, Rath moved with his family to Philadelphia where he grew up. Rath attended Swarthmore College but did not play for the Garnet Tide, as the school had not yet established a baseball program, but he did pledge the Delta Upsilon fraternity during his tenure.  He played on teams in the Philadelphia area and moved to professional baseball in 1908, playing in Wilmington, North Carolina, and Lynchburg, Virginia. After playing for the Reading Pretzels, Rath began his major league career as a bench player for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1909, appearing in seven games. He was traded in the middle of the 1910 season to the Cleveland Naps because the Athletics already had star second baseman Eddie Collins. He was sent to the Baltimore Orioles of the Eastern League before the end of the season.\nIn 1911, Rath was drafted by the Chicago White Sox. In 1912, he was the team's starting second baseman and had a breakthrough year, hitting .272 with 95 bases on balls and 30 stolen bases, in addition to outstanding defensive numbers. After a slow start in 1913, he was sent down to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association and remained in the minor leagues until 1917. In 1915, Rath led the International League with a .332 batting average while playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs. He then played for the Salt Lake City Bees in the Pacific Coast League in 1916 and 1917.\nIn 1918, Rath joined the U.S. Navy and missed the 1918 baseball season. The following year, he was back in the major leagues, given a chance to start by the Cincinnati Reds. In his comeback season he had a .264 batting average, drew 64 walks, and was the leadoff hitter for the pennant-winning Reds. He led all National League second basemen that year in assists, putouts, and double plays.[1]  In the 1919 World Series, Rath was hit by a pitch to start the series, which was later found out to be a signal used by White Sox pitcher Eddie Cicotte that the fix of the World Series was on.[2] At almost the very end of his career, Rath became one of only two players in modern major league history to play in three games in one day, playing in all three games of modern baseball's lone tripleheader on October 2, 1920.  (The other player to play in all three games was Cotton Tierney).  Rath only played in one further ML game after the tripleheader; after a mediocre 1920 season, Rath was sent to the Seattle Rainiers in the Pacific Coast League and then to the San Francisco Seals, where he ended his playing career.\nAccording to statistician Bill James, Rath's skills were generally unrecognized during his career. Before on-base percentage was considered an important statistic, there was little to distinguish him offensively. James wrote that Rath \"was actually quite a good player... but he spent almost all of his career in the minor leagues, just because his skills were too subtle for the men who managed the major league teams.\"[2]\nRath was the half-uncle of Mike Balenti, an opposing ballplayer in the American League, in that Balenti's mother was Rath's half-sister. There is no indication that either player was aware of this relationship during their lifetimes.[3][4]\nAfter his retirement from baseball, Rath ran a sporting goods store in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. It was in that town that he took his own life at age 57. He had reportedly been in poor health for a couple of years. He is buried at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania.\n",

        "paragraph": "The Freeman family murders occurred in Salisbury Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania on February 26, 1995. Two brothers, 17-year-old Bryan Freeman and 16-year-old David Freeman, and their cousin, 18-year-old Nelson \"Ben\" Birdwell III, brutally murdered the brothers' parents, Brenda and Dennis, and 11-year-old younger brother, Erik, at their family home. For several years the brothers had been embracing neo-Nazi culture, though this had escalated in the months leading up to the killings, with them going so far as to tattoo Nazi slogans on their foreheads. Both brothers and their cousin were given life sentences without the possibility of parole, though none of the three were convicted in the murder of Erik Freeman.[1] It was reported in 2014 that those sentences would be upheld, despite the recent Supreme Court ruling that mandatory life-without-parole sentences were unconstitutional for juveniles convicted of murder.[2][3]\nDennis and Brenda Freeman lived in Salisbury Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. Dennis worked as a janitor at a local high school.[4] He and his wife Brenda had three sons; the oldest was Bryan, followed by David, and then Erik. They were a very religious family and brought up their sons as Jehovah's Witnesses. Bryan and David resented their family lifestyle and turned to neo-Nazism.[5] Friends of Brenda spoke of how she was scared of both her older sons. Bryan and David shaved their heads, wore military uniforms, and embraced a neo-Nazi subculture. Bryan had the word \"Berserker\" tattooed across his forehead, and David had \"Sieg Heil\" tattooed above his eyebrows. Brenda reportedly telephoned counselors as well as psychologists to ask for advice. She managed to convince Bryan and David to attend \"anti-skinhead\" education sessions run by the police, but ultimately, her efforts to deter them from neo-Nazism failed.[6] Bryan had been admitted to hospital for mental illness, and David had been placed in several juvenile facilities as well as receiving treatment for substance abuse. According to Salisbury police, they had visited the Freeman home a total of five times between 1993 and 1995. Police said Bryan had also threatened to kill his parents in an altercation over using the family car.[7] Just days before the murders, Bryan had been suspended from Salisbury High School for drawing racist pictures in a book.[8]\nOn February 26, 1995, brothers 17-year-old Bryan Freeman and 16-year-old David Freeman, and their cousin, 18-year-old Ben Birdwell, arrived at the Freeman family home. The three of them had been out at the movies and had returned to the family home on Ehrets Lane. 48-year-old Brenda Freeman had an argument with Bryan and David about Birdwell being in the house. As Brenda came down the stairs, Bryan grabbed hold of her and forcefully wedged a pair of shorts into her mouth. He then stabbed her repeatedly to death with a steak knife he had retrieved from the kitchen.[9] David and Birdwell then went upstairs to the bedroom of 54-year-old Dennis Freeman, who was lying asleep in bed. The two of them then beat Dennis to death with a metal exercise bar and an aluminum baseball bat. Like his father, 11-year-old Erik was also lying asleep in bed. He was hit repeatedly with a 3-foot pickaxe handle until he died by one or several of the perpetrators. The trio then left the home armed with a 12-gauge shotgun and fled in Brenda's car, a 1988 Pontiac convertible.[10][11]\nThe bodies of the Freemans were found in their home by Dennis's sister, Valerie Freeman, on the day after they had been murdered.[12] Coroners in Allentown described the killings as one of the most brutal acts of murder they had ever seen.[13] Lehigh County district attorney Bob Steinberg also described the murders as brutal, claiming the faces of both Dennis and Erik had been beaten and bludgeoned so badly that they were nearly beyond recognition.[8] The Freeman brothers and Birdwell fled to Hope, Michigan, to the home of Frank Hesse, who was a skinhead associate. The Freeman brothers had met Hesse at a New Year's Eve concert and had exchanged phone numbers. They were captured and arrested at the home three days after the murders had occurred.[14]\nTo avoid the death penalty, Bryan pleaded guilty to Brenda's murder, while David pleaded guilty to the murder of Dennis. Birdwell was tried for all three murders and was convicted of the murder of Dennis Freeman after DNA testing matched blood on his T-shirt as belonging to Dennis.[15] No one was convicted for Erik's murder.[3] Bryan confessed that the murders had stemmed from years of ongoing animosity between the brothers and their parents. All three suspects were spared the death penalty, but each was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.[1][16][17] The men are incarcerated in the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. Bryan is imprisoned in State Correctional Institution \u2013 Coal Township under inmate number CX3426, David is imprisoned in State Correctional Institution \u2013 Mahanoy under inmate number CX3437, and Birdwell is imprisoned in State Correctional Institution \u2013 Greene under inmate number DA9633.[18]\nBryan Robert Freeman (born January 7, 1978),[18] David Jonathan Freeman (born February 9, 1979),[18] and Nelson Benjamin \"Ben\" Birdwell III (born February 13, 1977),[18] were identified as the three perpetrators of the crime. All three identified as neo-Nazis but they were not part of any neo-Nazi group.[19] The trio were allegedly planning on forming their own neo-Nazi group prior to the murders. Valerie Freeman had noticed a change in Bryan and David's behavior. She described her nephews as becoming defiant and combative. The Freeman brothers expressed regret and remorse over the crime on the 20th anniversary of the killings.[20] Bryan Freeman made a statement in which he admitted to doing a terrible thing and that he deserved to be punished.[3][21][22]\nThe Freeman family murders occurred in one of the most violent periods of Lehigh Valley history. Between January and May of 1995, there were a total of fourteen homicides in the area.[10] The day after the Freeman brothers and Birdwell were captured, on March 2, 1995, 17-year-old Jeffrey Howorth shot and killed both of his parents, George and Susan Howorth, with a hunting rifle. Jeffrey waited at his Lower Macungie Township family home for his parents to return and then murdered them separately. He then fled the area and was arrested on March 4, 1995, two days after the killings. He was apprehended in Missouri after his car ran out of gas. At his trial, it was learned that Howorth had been inspired to commit the crime from hearing about the Freeman family murders. Howorth wrote a note in an apparent reference to the Freeman brothers. Later that year, Howorth was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was acquitted of the killings of his parents. Howorth was involuntarily committed and currently remains located at Wernersville State Hospital under state supervision, in Berks County, Pennsylvania.[10]\nTrue crime author Fred Rosen wrote a book called Blood Crimes, which was about the Freeman family murders. The book details the story of the Freeman brothers and divulges the history of the Freeman family.[23] On December 14, 2015, WatchMojo released a video called Top 10 Most Evil Kids in History. Bryan and David Freeman were featured at number six on the list. As of 2021, the video has over sixteen million views on YouTube.[24] In 2014, the stories of both the Freeman family murders and the Howorth killings were featured in the same episode of the documentary series Killer Kids.[25]\nOn February 11, 2022, the murders were recounted on the Oxygen series Killer Siblings episode \"Freemans.\"\n",

        "paragraph": "Margaret Martin (1918/19 \u2013 December 1938) was a resident of Kingston, Pennsylvania, United States, who went missing on December 17, 1938, and was found dead in Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, several days later.[2] Martin was a recent graduate of the Wilkes-Barre Business College. On December 17, 1938, she met an unknown man who claimed to be offering her a secretarial job, and was never seen alive again. Her body was discovered in the wilderness 25 miles (40\u00a0km) away by a hunter four days later. Martin's death resulted in a lengthy manhunt. Numerous suspects were examined, but no one was ever convicted of the crime. As of 2023, it remains an unsolved case.\nMargaret Martin was a resident of Kingston, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.[2] She graduated from Kingston High School in 1937.[3] She took classes at the Wilkes-Barre Business College to gain secretarial skills and graduated with honors at the beginning of December 1938.[1][3] She was 19 years old at the time of her death.[2]\nAccording to Betty Hopkins, a former classmate, Martin was \"a shy, studious, friendly girl who had many friends.\"[3] Her parents described her as \"a living saint.\"[1] She was also a devout Catholic.[4]\nMartin's father was John Martin, a local foreman and minor politician.[1] Margaret Martin was the eldest of four children.[5]\nOn December 17, 1938, a man contacted Martin, claiming that he was setting up an insurance company and needed a secretary,[3] adding that he had heard of her through the Wilkes-Barre Business College.[6] The two agreed to meet in Kingston Corners, not far from Martin's home.[3]\nMartin was first noted to be missing that evening, after she had failed to return home from the alleged job interview.[2][3] Several witnesses said they saw her getting into a brown Plymouth or black sedan with a man after a brief conversation.[2][4][7] This was the last time she was seen alive.[2][3][4] The witnesses were able to give only vague descriptions of the man, described as a \"suave, neat, sandy-haired young man,\" and did not identify the car's license plate.[1][2] The man was between 25 and 30 years of age and slightly overweight.[4] Martin's friends and family called the police and started a search, but her disappearance was difficult to publicize since the local newspapers were on strike.[3]\nAccording to a 1999 article in the Times Leader, Martin was tortured and murdered in a sawmill in the mountains about 15 miles (24\u00a0km) from the creek where her body was found.[3] According to theories by the police, the killer had attempted to dismember her body and destroy it in the mill's firebox, but had been scared off by the mill's owner, James Kedd. Kedd had assumed that the killer was a mere trespasser and had fired a warning shot in the killer's direction.[3] The killer then drove to a point close to the creek and carried Martin's body the final 75 yards to the creek, where he abandoned it.[5]\nInitially, it was suspected that Martin's disappearance was linked to a sex slavery ring.[1] However, her body was discovered in the forested wilderness of Northmoreland Township, Wyoming County, on December 21, 1938, about 25 miles (40\u00a0km) from her home.[3][6][8] The discoverer was 19-year-old Anthony Rezykowski, who was trapping muskrats in the area.[2][3] Rezykowski noticed a large burlap bag partially submerged in 2 feet (0.61\u00a0m) of water in a creek.[5] Upon further investigation, he found the bag to contain the mutilated body of a young woman with no clothing. The body was soon identified as Margaret Martin.[2] At the time of her body's discovery, she had been dead for at least 24 hours. If not for Rezykowski's discovery of her body, it may have gone unnoticed for several years.[5]\nMartin's body showed signs of having been beaten\u2014perhaps with a rock\u2014and strangled.[2] She had bruises on her throat and body, as well as knife wounds on her stomach and thigh.[1][3] Her autopsy found the cause of death to be strangulation and stated that she had \"suffered the molestation of a degenerate.\"[1][2]\n",

The West Nickel Mines School was later demolished, and a new one-room schoolhouse, the New Hope School, was built at another location.\nRoberts backed a pickup truck to the front of the Amish schoolhouse and entered it at approximately 10:25\u00a0a.m. EDT, soon after the children had returned from recess. He asked the teacher, Emma Mae Zook, and the students if they had seen a missing clevis pin on the road. Survivors said he mumbled his words and did not make direct eye contact. After they said they had not seen a clevis pin, he went back to his truck and reentered the school holding a Springfield Armory XD 9mm handgun. He ordered the boys to help him carry items into the classroom from the truck. Zook and her mother, who was visiting, took this opportunity to escape and run toward a nearby farm for help. Roberts saw them leave, and ordered one of the boys to stop them, threatening to shoot everyone if they got away.[5]\nThey reached the farm, where they asked Amos Smoker to call 9-1-1. Meanwhile, the boys carried in lumber, a shotgun, a stun-gun, wires, chains, nails, tools, a small bag and wooden board with multiple sets of metal eye-hooks. The bag held a change of clothes, toilet paper, candles, and flexible plastic ties. Using wooden boards, Roberts barricaded the front door.[5]\nRoberts ordered the girls to line up against the chalkboard and allowed a pregnant woman, three parents with infants, and all remaining boys to exit. One girl, nine-year-old Emma Fisher, escaped without her older sister.[6]\nSmoker's 9-1-1 call was recorded at 10:36\u00a0a.m.  An article, \"Revisiting the Amish Schoolhouse Massacre\", described the situation prior to the arrival of the first Pennsylvania State Police troopers: \"An Amish adult male from this farm, with his two large dogs, took the bold opportunity to stealthily approach the windowless back wall of the schoolhouse. Hoping for an opportunity to help the little girls, he slowly crept around one side of the wooden structure and positioned himself as an observer next to a side window.\" It continued, \"Observing that the first police patrol vehicle to approach the scene was not slowing down to stop, the Amish man quickly withdrew from his hiding place and sprinted towards the roadway to wave down the trooper, who did a fast U-turn and parked. That would be the last successful attempt at an unnoticed move upon the building by anyone.\"[7][8]\nThe first trooper had arrived at approximately 10:42, about six or seven minutes after the 9-1-1 call. The police, while waiting for reinforcements, attempted to communicate with Roberts via the PA system in their patrol cars.[5] They asked Roberts to throw out his weapons and exit the schoolhouse. Roberts refused, demanding that the officers leave.[9] By 11:00\u00a0a.m. a large crowd \u2014 including police officers, emergency medical technicians, and residents of the village \u2014 had assembled both outside the schoolhouse and at a nearby ambulance staging area. County and state police dispatchers had briefly established telephone contact with Roberts as he continued to threaten violence against the children.[8]\nDuring interviews conducted later it became apparent that all of the girls recognized the danger they were in. Some conversed among themselves throughout the ordeal. Shortly before Roberts began shooting, two sisters, Marian and Barbara Fisher, ages 13 and 11, requested that they be shot first, so that the others might be spared. Barbara was wounded, while Marian was killed.[10]\nAt approximately 11:07\u00a0a.m., Roberts began shooting the victims. State troopers immediately approached. As the first trooper in line reached a window, the shooting stopped abruptly; Roberts had committed suicide. During the shooting, he fired at least 13 rounds from his pistol.[11]\n",

Geiger was arrested in 2008 on the 23rd anniversary of Reed's death and was found guilty of third-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, evidence tampering, and abuse of corpse, among other offenses.[1][3][4]\nReed and his siblings, James and Virginia, had begun using marijuana from young adolescence, and had even begun dealing it themselves during 1985.[3] On the night of August 21, 1985, 13-year-old Reed left home on his bicycle to meet up with friends 20-year-old Joe Geiger and 14-year-old John F. Fry, Jr., to drink beer and smoke pot in an abandoned caboose at the local train station.[1][2][3]\nAfter a while, Geiger began to accuse Reed of stealing his illegally grown cannabis plants. Suddenly, Geiger stood up and shocked Reed and Fry by roundhouse punching Reed in the head, causing Reed to fall out of the caboose and slam his skull into the metal rails of the train tracks. Reed was knocked unconscious but was still breathing.[1][2]\nGeiger told Fry to leave at this point. Fry, intimidated by the older boy's larger stature, left. Fry did not participate in the actual murder and cover-up of the murder that followed. Years later, he admitted to police that he had had no idea of Reed's death until Reed's body was discovered.[2][3]\nGeiger then carried Reed's body a few hundred yards into the surrounding woods in Cressona where he left the body. The location of Reed's body was less than 100 yards from the Reed's home, however the body was not discovered until December 1985.[2]\nReed's mother called police when David failed to return home the next day.[5]\nIn December 1985, Geiger reported to the Schuylkill Haven police department that\u2014over the course of 3 to 4 months\u2014his two pet dogs had been retrieving bones from the woods in Cressona, where he often allowed them to play. Geiger said that he had no idea the bones were human until the dogs had brought back a human skull.[2] The body was identified positively as that of David W. Reed by authorities. Police noted that the body was about a half mile from his bicycle.\nBecause he was the one to report the discovery of Reed's body, both the authorities and Reed's family did not suspect Geiger played a role in Reed's death. In fact, authorities did not suspect foul play at all. Although they did report that the death seemed \"suspicious,\" they were satisfied with a coroner's at the University of Penn's conclusion that Reed plausibly had died of previously undiagnosed diabetes complications upon autopsy.[2][3] The actual case files ruled the death as \"undetermined\" in April 1986, and the case laid cold for the next 20 years.[1][2][3]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nTodd Morgan Beamer (November 24, 1968 \u2013 September 11, 2001) was an American passenger aboard United Airlines Flight 93, which was hijacked and crashed as part of the September 11 attacks in 2001. He was one of the passengers who attempted to regain control of the aircraft from the hijackers. During the struggle, the Boeing 757 lost control and crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing everyone on board, but saving the hijackers' intended target and additional victims.\nTodd Beamer was born on November 24, 1968, in Flint, Michigan, to David Beamer, an IBM sales representative, and Peggy Jackson Beamer, a muralist,[1] the middle child of three and only son.[2] Beamer and his two sisters, Melissa and Michele, were raised \"with a strong biblical value system and work ethic\". The family relocated to Poughkeepsie, New York, and then to Wheaton, Illinois, a suburb west of Chicago, where David worked at Amdahl, a computer technology company.[1]\nBeamer attended Wheaton Christian Grammar School, where he played soccer, basketball, and baseball.[1] He attended Wheaton Academy, a Christian high school, from 1983 to 1985,[3] where he excelled in the same sports.[4] He was elected class vice president in his junior year. After David was promoted to vice president of Amdahl's California headquarters, the family moved, and Beamer spent his senior year at Los Gatos High School, southwest of San Jose, California.[1]\nBeamer attended Fresno State University, where he majored in physical therapy and played baseball, in the hopes of playing professionally, but injuries he suffered in an automobile accident ended these plans. He returned home to Illinois and transferred to Wheaton College, a Christian liberal arts college. At Wheaton College he majored initially in medicine before switching to business. He continued to play baseball and as a senior became captain of the basketball team.[1] He graduated in 1991.[5]\nWhile at Wheaton College, he met Lisa Brosious, his future wife, during a senior seminar class.[1][4] Their first date was November 2, 1991, the 10-year anniversary of which they had been planning to celebrate at the time of his death.[4]\nBeamer subsequently worked for Wilson Sporting Goods while taking night classes at\nDePaul University, earning an M.B.A. in June 1993.[1][4]\nBeamer married Brosious on May 14, 1994, in Peekskill, New York, and they moved to Plainsboro, New Jersey, where Beamer began working with Oracle Corporation, selling systems applications and database software as a field marketing representative.[1][4] Within months, Beamer was promoted to account manager.[1]\nBeamer and Lisa taught Sunday school at Princeton Alliance Church for six years, and worked in youth ministry.[1][4] Beamer also played on the church softball team. He was a staunch fan of the Chicago Cubs, Chicago Bulls and Chicago Bears.[4] In 2000, the Beamers moved to Cranbury, New Jersey,[1][4][6] with their two sons.[6]\n",

        "paragraph": "\nJennifer Lee Daugherty (November 8, 1979\u00a0\u2013 February 11, 2010) was an American woman who was torture-murdered in Greensburg, Pennsylvania as an act of revenge in February 2010. Daugherty, who was mentally disabled, was tortured and murdered before being wrapped in Christmas decorations, put inside a garbage can, and dumped in the parking lot of Greensburg-Salem Middle School.\nAmber Meidinger met Melvin Knight at a homeless shelter in Washington in January 2010. They moved to several locations before settling in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, where they met Jennifer Daugherty.[1] Knight met Ricky Smyrnes after meeting previously in jail.[2]\nMelvin L. Knight (born October 27, 1989)[3] was born to a drug-addicted father who was imprisoned during the early years of his life. He developed lifelong learning and social problems after he fell out of a moving vehicle and hit his head at age 5.[4]\nAngela Lynn Marinucci (born July 14, 1992),[3] according to testimony by her mother and half-sister, Marinucci suffered a head injury when she was hit by a truck in 2008, at the age of 15. The injury substantially altered her behavior and pushed her into a downward spiral that ended with Daugherty\u2019s death, according to the defense. Two mental experts testified that Marinucci as a child, suffered from depression and that she may have had drug and alcohol addictions as a teenager.[5]\nMeidinger told jurors, \"at some point, she [Daugherty] trusted me because she knew me from the West Place (a center for people with special needs).\" Meidinger testified she and her then-boyfriend and co-defendant Melvin Knight met Smyrnes on February 8, 2010, after she and Knight had been staying at a Greensburg-area hotel. Knight and Smyrnes knew each other after meeting in jail, and Meidinger was pregnant with Knight's child when all three met up. Smyrnes offered Meidinger and Knight to stay at his apartment at 428 N. Pennsylvania Avenue in Greensburg.[6]\nRicky Ven Edward Smyrnes (born March 6, 1986)[3] was born to a drug-addicted Philadelphia sex worker and a Pittsburgh gang member. He was moved into and out of foster homes as a child and was treated for mental health disorders as early as age 4. He suffered abuse and neglect until he was taken in by the Smyrnes family in North Huntingdon at age 10, according to testimony by forensic psychologist Alice Applegate.[7] His lawyer, Terri Fayes, told the jury that Smyrnes suffered sexual and physical abuse from his father and his uncle. She also explained how he had tried beer, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana by age 6, had been diagnosed with PTSD at age 8, and had undergone 103 therapy sessions by age 10. She added he was diagnosed as having as many as seven different personalities, and 15 total psychiatric issues. In 1997, he burglarized his neighbor's home and stole knives, guitars, coins, bullets, and cash. That same year, he sexually assaulted a woman in her basement.[8]\nAccording to a testimony by Meidinger, the group went through her purse and stole money, gift cards, and her cell phone. They poured liquids into her bag, hit her head with filled soda bottles, cut her hair, painted her face with nail polish, and dumped liquid and spices on her head. Meidinger said she and Angela Marinucci took turns violently hitting Daugherty with a metal towel rack and crutches. She also noted that Daugherty was stripped naked, gagged, and raped by Knight.[1] They also forced her to consume feces, urine, and detergent.[9][10] Meidinger also said Knight took Daugherty to the living room where Marinucci poured a bottle of water over Daugherty's head and Knight and Smyrnes dumped oatmeal and spices on her head. Daugherty said that her eyes were burning, and Smyrnes told her to take a shower because she smelled bad.[2]\nAccording to her relatives, Daugherty had the mental abilities of an adolescent, trusted everyone, and thought that the suspects were her \"friends.\"[11]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Wilmington Riot of 1968 occurred in Wilmington, Delaware, in April of that year following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The riot did not cause any fatalities, though there were numerous injuries, arrests, and buildings burned. Despite the quick cessation of rioting, the governor refused to recall the Delaware Army National Guard, leaving them in the city as an occupying force until the following year. \nPrior to the events of the late 1960s, tensions were already running high in Wilmington.  There had already been a race riot in 1919. The flight of white city dwellers to the suburbs, migration of southern blacks to the city, and lingering bad feelings from the construction of I-95 resulted in a divided city, and attempts by local leaders to alleviate the social issue plaguing the city were unsuccessful.[1][2] Heightened racial tensions and altercations in July 1967 were followed by two days of sporadic vandalism, looting, and firebombing. At the request of Wilmington Mayor John Babiarz, state police were summoned to increase patrols. For his part, Governor Charles L. Terry (a southern-style Democrat) publicly warned of minority violence and conspiracies and placed fifteen hundred National Guardsmen on standby alert at Wilmington's airport.  He also proposed and signed legislation granting him sole authority to impose martial law and ban the sale of alcohol and established a riot commission.  In addition to the Delaware National Guard, the Governor activated the entire Delaware State Police Department.  All days off were canceled, vacations were canceled and all troopers were to report to their assigned Troop.  The Delaware State Police who were nearest to the City of Wilmington were sent to Troop 2 located south of the city.  Only a skeleton force was left at the other Troops located in New Castle County.  The Troopers who were assigned to Kent and Sussex counties Troops were sent to Troop 2.  Once the lower county Troopers arrived at Troop 2 they were paired with those of New Castle County.  Any request for law enforcement assistance from the Wilmington Police Department was sent to Troop 2.\nIn the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, a large number of black youths converged on the main downtown business area of Wilmington and began looting stores April 9\u201310, 1968. A report of sniper fire prompted Democratic mayor Babiarz to declare a state of emergency, to impose a curfew, and to request assistance from Governor Terry. The two-day riot that occurred after the assassination was small compared with riots in other cities, but its aftermath highlighted the depth of Wilmington's racial problem.[3]\n",

He abducted most of his victims from U.S. Route 40, near Bear.\nThe first victim was 23-year-old Shirley Anna Ellis, a nurse. On November 29, 1987, she left Wilmington Hospital around 6 PM, where she was aiding an AIDS patient, catching a lift on her way home on Route 40. Her body was later found by the roadside by two boys. She was partially nude, her legs spread out, hands and feet tied with adhesive tape. There were no signs of sexual assault, but she had been seriously abused, with her killer tying a string around her neck and hitting her head with a hammer before she died.[1]\nThe second victim was 31-year-old Catherine A. DiMauro. On June 28, 1988, about seven months after the first murder, around 11:30 PM, she was seen walking down Route 40. At 6:25 AM, construction workers found her naked body at a construction site. No signs of sexual assault were found. Like Ellis, she was killed by hammer blows and strangulation, but unlike the first murder, DiMauro's body was covered in blue fibers.\n",

White was a black farmer who was accused of the rape and murder of Helen Bishop, who was arrested and brought to the workhouse. On the evening of June 22, under the impression that the local authorities were not reacting severely or soon enough, a large mob of white men marched to the workhouse, broke their way in, and forced White out of his cell. He was then brought to the site of Helen Bishop's death, bludgeoned, had parts of his body dismembered, then was tied to a stake, and burnt to death.[4] It is often referred to as the only documented lynching in Delaware, and as one of the worst crimes in Delaware history.[5]\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries were times of high racial tension in the United States. This also coincided with a national pattern of racial violence. Between the years 1882 and 1921, the United States experienced more than 3,405 lynchings.[6] Most of these victims were black men, but women and children were also targeted. While many people did not believe in lynching, others found them not only acceptable but necessary. These events were sometimes referred to as \"unofficial executions.\"[6] In 1903 specifically, there was a wave of lynchings across the midwest, including events in Evansville, Indiana, Springfield, Ohio, Belleville, and Danville, Illinois.\nThese attitudes were especially complicated in Delaware. In his documentary \"In the Dead Fire's Ashes,\" Stephen Labovsky describes the town of Wilmington as \"North of the South but South of the North.\" This is because of its position as a border state during and after the U.S. Civil War. Scholar Michael J. Pfeifer describes this contradiction, saying \"If the area's commercial interests were more aligned with...the industrial North, the state's social politics continued to reflect a Jim Crow orientation on matters of race and rights.\"[7]\n",

        "paragraph": "James Allen Red Dog (February 1, 1954 \u2013 March 3, 1993) was a mixed Sioux and Assiniboine serial killer from Fort Peck Indian Reservation who was executed at his own request for murdering Hugh Pennington and who had previously been convicted twice of armed robbery. As a result of his crimes, Joe Biden introduced legislation that required states to be notified by federal officials when dangerous criminals were placed in their jurisdictions.[1][2]\nRed Dog's heritage was a mix of (Dakota) Sioux and Assiniboine.[3][4] He was a member of the Dakota tribe,[5] and grew up on Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, in northeast Montana.[6][4][7] He blamed poverty on his reservation for his crimes later in life; he said that there were no jobs and he could only make a living on crime. According to a family acquaintance, who asked not to be named, at age 8 or 10 Red Dog tried to emulate the lifestyle of an older half-brother whom he admired, who as of 1993 was in a federal prison. The acquaintance also said that life had \"very little\" to offer Red Dog.[3]\nDelaware deputy attorneys Steven P. Wood and Peggy J. Hageman, who prosecuted Red Dog, tried and failed to find a motive.[8] According to Wood, attributing Red Dog's behavior to his upbringing is too easy: \"There is no denying the privation Native Americans are subjected to on reservations, but the simple fact is there are hundreds of thousands of Native Americans raised in those conditions, and precious few become multiple murders\", he said, as well as that his killings were \"essentially motiveless\".[3]\n",

McDole was in a wheelchair at the time of the shooting. Police responded to a call about a man with a gun. The 911 caller later recanted her statements and has, to date, faced no penalties for the false statements made, which resulted in McDoles death. Camera footage from a bystander showed officers ordering McDole to drop his weapon and raise his hands, with McDole being shot after reaching for his waist area, but with a gun never being seen and evidence photos of the reported weapon only appearing 6 years after his murder.[3][4][5] The Delaware state department cleared the officers of wrongdoing, but concluded that one of the involved officers had shown \"extraordinarily poor\" police work. A 2020 review by the Delaware Attorney General's Office came to the same conclusion. Both decided against filing any charges. The McDole family sued the city of Wilmington, and in January 2017, a settlement of $1.5 million was reached by the city.[2][3]\nOn September 23, 2015, at around 3:00\u00a0p.m., local police in Wilmington, Delaware responded to a 911 call about a man who had suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The female caller told the dispatcher that a man had shot himself, still had the weapon, and had fallen onto the ground but was moving back into his wheelchair.[6]\n",

Johnson (November 18, 1983 \u2013 April 20, 2012)[1] was an American convicted murderer and rapist who was executed for the 2006 murder of 25-year-old Cameron Hamlin in Wilmington, Delaware. Johnson was executed by lethal injection at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center on April 20, 2012.[2] Capital punishment was declared unconstitutional in Delaware on August 2, 2016, officially making Johnson the last person to be executed by the state of Delaware.[3]\nJohnson's criminal record consisted of 57 arrests on 145 misdemeanor charges and 33 felony offenses since 2001. On December 19, 2002, Johnson raped a pregnant woman. He pleaded guilty to fourth degree rape for that crime. This prior violent felony conviction would make Hamlin's murder a capital offense.[4] Johnson was also suspected in the shooting of his stepfather.[4]\nOn September 24, 2006, Johnson went to the home of his ex-girlfriend, Lakeisha Truitt, in Wilmington, Delaware. The relationship between the two had ended due to Johnson abusing Truitt, but the pair had a son together.[4] Johnson had hoped to reconcile with Truitt and had gone round to see her, but instead he came across Truitt and 25-year-old Cameron Hamlin, who was Truitt's new boyfriend and had been staying at Truitt's home. He spotted Hamlin and Truitt sitting in front of her home in a car. Johnson pulled out a gun and began firing into the car, fatally wounding Hamlin. He then fled the scene. Truitt was not injured in the shooting and ran to her grandmother's house where she called the police. Due to concern for her safety, she was advised not to return home until Johnson was caught.[5]\n",

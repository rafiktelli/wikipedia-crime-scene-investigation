His increasingly extremist anti-police, black supremacist, and anti-white views are believed to have solidified following a November 1972 violent clash between Baton Rouge police officers and student civil rights demonstrators, during which two young black demonstrators were shot and killed.[5]\n"

[4] The violence erupted outside the Mechanics Institute, site of a reconvened Louisiana Constitutional Convention. The Republican Party of Louisiana had called for the Convention, as they were angered by the legislature's enactment of the Black Codes and refusal to extend voting rights to Black men. White Democrats considered the reconvened convention to be illegal and were hostile towards Republican attempts to gain increased political power in the state. The massacre \"stemmed from deeply rooted political, social, and economic causes,\"[5] and took place in part because of the battle \"between two opposing factions for power and office.\"[5] According to the official report, a total of 38 were killed and 146 wounded, of whom 34 dead and 119 wounded were Black Freedmen. Unofficial estimates were higher.[6] Gilles Vandal estimated 40 to 50 Black Americans were killed and more than 150 Black Americans wounded.[7] Others have claimed nearly 200 were killed.[8] In addition, three white convention attendees were killed, as was one white protester.[9]\nDuring much of the American Civil War, New Orleans had been occupied and under martial law imposed by the Union. On May 12, 1866, Mayor John T. Monroe, a Democrat who had ardently supported the Confederacy, was reinstated as acting mayor, the position he held before the war. Judge R. K. Howell was elected as chairman of the convention, with the goal of increasing participation by voters likely to vote for removal of the Black Codes.[10]\n"

His 17-year-old cousin Albert Harris, Jr. was tortured and left for dead alongside Jones. This was the only known post-World War II lynching to occur in Louisiana, and it involved multiple well-known local individuals, politicians, and a cover-up by multiple law enforcement entities.[1]\nOn the night of July 30, 1946, a pregnant woman complained to her husband that she had been startled by a prowler in their yard. The next day, the husband looked around his yard and found that a window screen had been tampered with, along with some grass and a portion of the fence that surrounded the yard. He looked to the neighboring house and saw Albert Harris, Jr. holding a stick and sitting on the front porch. The husband talked to his father, and ultimately two civilians and two Webster Parish Sheriff's Deputies went to the Harris house and arrested Albert, Jr. He was held in jail for a few days without charge and released by Webster Parish Deputy Sheriff O.H. Haynes, Jr. in Dixie Inn to a mob. The mob took Albert, Jr. to a field in rural Webster Parish, tied him upside down to a pipe, covered his head, and at gunpoint, they forced him by way of multiple beatings to implicate his cousin (Jones) as an accomplice in the alleged prowling. After Albert, Jr. was released by the mob, his parents sent him out of the state. On August 3, 1946, two deputies, including Haynes, went to the Harris' house to procure Albert, Jr. One of the deputies smashed Albert Harris, Sr.'s jaw and told him to bring Albert, Jr. back into custody. Albert, Jr. was returned to the sheriff's custody August 4. Jones had been arrested on August 3 in connection with the matter. While both men were in jail, they were questioned by the husband's father and deputies. They were also beaten by deputies. They were held several days without charge.[2]\n"

The Republican Party of Louisiana had called for the Convention, as they were angered by the legislature's enactment of the Black Codes and refusal to extend voting rights to Black men. White Democrats considered the reconvened convention to be illegal and were hostile towards Republican attempts to gain increased political power in the state. The massacre \"stemmed from deeply rooted political, social, and economic causes,\"[5] and took place in part because of the battle \"between two opposing factions for power and office.\"[5] According to the official report, a total of 38 were killed and 146 wounded, of whom 34 dead and 119 wounded were Black Freedmen. Unofficial estimates were higher.[6] Gilles Vandal estimated 40 to 50 Black Americans were killed and more than 150 Black Americans wounded.[7] Others have claimed nearly 200 were killed.[8] In addition, three white convention attendees were killed, as was one white protester.[9]\nDuring much of the American Civil War, New Orleans had been occupied and under martial law imposed by the Union. On May 12, 1866, Mayor John T. Monroe, a Democrat who had ardently supported the Confederacy, was reinstated as acting mayor, the position he held before the war. Judge R. K.

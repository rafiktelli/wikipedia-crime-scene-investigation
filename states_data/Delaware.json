        "paragraph": "The lynching of George White occurred on Monday, June 22, 1903 in Wilmington, Delaware. White was a black farmer who was accused of the rape and murder of Helen Bishop, who was arrested and brought to the workhouse. On the evening of June 22, under the impression that the local authorities were not reacting severely or soon enough, a large mob of white men marched to the workhouse, broke their way in, and forced White out of his cell. He was then brought to the site of Helen Bishop's death, bludgeoned, had parts of his body dismembered, then was tied to a stake, and burnt to death.[4] It is often referred to as the only documented lynching in Delaware, and as one of the worst crimes in Delaware history.[5]\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries were times of high racial tension in the United States. This also coincided with a national pattern of racial violence. Between the years 1882 and 1921, the United States experienced more than 3,405 lynchings.[6] Most of these victims were black men, but women and children were also targeted. While many people did not believe in lynching, others found them not only acceptable but necessary. These events were sometimes referred to as \"unofficial executions.\"[6] In 1903 specifically, there was a wave of lynchings across the midwest, including events in Evansville, Indiana, Springfield, Ohio, Belleville, and Danville, Illinois.\nThese attitudes were especially complicated in Delaware. In his documentary \"In the Dead Fire's Ashes,\" Stephen Labovsky describes the town of Wilmington as \"North of the South but South of the North.\" This is because of its position as a border state during and after the U.S. Civil War. Scholar Michael J. Pfeifer describes this contradiction, saying \"If the area's commercial interests were more aligned with...the industrial North, the state's social politics continued to reflect a Jim Crow orientation on matters of race and rights.\"[7]\n",

As a result of his crimes, Joe Biden introduced legislation that required states to be notified by federal officials when dangerous criminals were placed in their jurisdictions.[1][2]\nRed Dog's heritage was a mix of (Dakota) Sioux and Assiniboine.[3][4] He was a member of the Dakota tribe,[5] and grew up on Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, in northeast Montana.[6][4][7] He blamed poverty on his reservation for his crimes later in life; he said that there were no jobs and he could only make a living on crime. According to a family acquaintance, who asked not to be named, at age 8 or 10 Red Dog tried to emulate the lifestyle of an older half-brother whom he admired, who as of 1993 was in a federal prison. The acquaintance also said that life had \"very little\" to offer Red Dog.[3]\nDelaware deputy attorneys Steven P. Wood and Peggy J. Hageman, who prosecuted Red Dog, tried and failed to find a motive.[8] According to Wood, attributing Red Dog's behavior to his upbringing is too easy: \"There is no denying the privation Native Americans are subjected to on reservations, but the simple fact is there are hundreds of thousands of Native Americans raised in those conditions, and precious few become multiple murders\", he said, as well as that his killings were \"essentially motiveless\".[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "The Wilmington Riot of 1968 occurred in Wilmington, Delaware, in April of that year following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The riot did not cause any fatalities, though there were numerous injuries, arrests, and buildings burned. Despite the quick cessation of rioting, the governor refused to recall the Delaware Army National Guard, leaving them in the city as an occupying force until the following year. \nPrior to the events of the late 1960s, tensions were already running high in Wilmington.  There had already been a race riot in 1919. The flight of white city dwellers to the suburbs, migration of southern blacks to the city, and lingering bad feelings from the construction of I-95 resulted in a divided city, and attempts by local leaders to alleviate the social issue plaguing the city were unsuccessful.[1][2] Heightened racial tensions and altercations in July 1967 were followed by two days of sporadic vandalism, looting, and firebombing. At the request of Wilmington Mayor John Babiarz, state police were summoned to increase patrols. For his part, Governor Charles L. Terry (a southern-style Democrat) publicly warned of minority violence and conspiracies and placed fifteen hundred National Guardsmen on standby alert at Wilmington's airport.  He also proposed and signed legislation granting him sole authority to impose martial law and ban the sale of alcohol and established a riot commission.  In addition to the Delaware National Guard, the Governor activated the entire Delaware State Police Department.  All days off were canceled, vacations were canceled and all troopers were to report to their assigned Troop.  The Delaware State Police who were nearest to the City of Wilmington were sent to Troop 2 located south of the city.  Only a skeleton force was left at the other Troops located in New Castle County.  The Troopers who were assigned to Kent and Sussex counties Troops were sent to Troop 2.  Once the lower county Troopers arrived at Troop 2 they were paired with those of New Castle County.  Any request for law enforcement assistance from the Wilmington Police Department was sent to Troop 2.\nIn the wake of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, a large number of black youths converged on the main downtown business area of Wilmington and began looting stores April 9\u201310, 1968. A report of sniper fire prompted Democratic mayor Babiarz to declare a state of emergency, to impose a curfew, and to request assistance from Governor Terry. The two-day riot that occurred after the assassination was small compared with riots in other cities, but its aftermath highlighted the depth of Wilmington's racial problem.[3]\n",

A habitual criminal with a murder conviction in his native state of Delaware, he became known for murdering two homeless women in Florida in 2022. Devonshire died from medical complications while awaiting trial, but was posthumously linked to both crimes via DNA.\nLittle is known about Devonshire's early life. Born on September 23, 1969, in Wilmington, Delaware, he started committing crimes at age 14 and by the time of his first murder he had accrued convictions for a variety of crimes in the states of Delaware, Maryland, Indiana, Ohio and New Jersey. His rap sheet included crimes such as assault, aggravated assault, disorderly conduct, battery, burglary, and trespassing.[1]\nBy 2003, Devonshire was residing in Magnolia, where he lived on the same street as 51-year-old Albert C. Harris Sr. On April 6, Harris was found bludgeoned to death inside his mobile home on Irish Hill Road.[2] The murder came as a shock to locals, who theorized that it was likely committed by someone acquainted with him.[3]\n",

Lemuel is thought to have shot Zebley through the heart.[3]\nAs news of the shooting spread an angry white mob grew and tried to lynch the three brothers. Wilmington police were able to prevent this by secreting the brothers to Philadelphia's Central police station.[4] When the mob found out the brothers were out of their reach they turned their anger on the black community. One mob of 300 whites were rampaging through the black part of town. When they encountered 4 black men, the two parties shot at each other and African-American Bannel Fields was wounded with a shot in the head.[4]\n",

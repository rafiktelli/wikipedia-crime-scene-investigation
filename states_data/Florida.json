Britton was a physician working at the clinic; he and his escort James Barrett were shot to death as they arrived on July 29 by anti-abortion protester Paul Jennings Hill. Barrett's wife June was also wounded.[1][2] Previously, the clinic had been bombed twice in 1984; a pipe bomb destroyed the building on June 25 of that year, and four youths\u2014Matt Goldsby, Jimmy Simmons, Kathy Simmons, and Kaye Wiggins\u2014bombed it on Christmas Day, calling the crime \"a gift to Jesus on his birthday.\" These bombers stated that they were also behind the June bombing.[2][3]\nOn January 1, 2012, Bobby Joe Rogers firebombed the clinic with a Molotov cocktail; the fire gutted the building. Rogers told investigators that he was motivated to commit the crime by his opposition to abortion, and that what more directly prompted the act was seeing a patient enter the clinic during one of the frequent anti-abortion protests there.[4]\n"

Coffey was found unresponsive on a couch the morning after the event, and his death became part of a national wave of criticism of fraternity hazing practices. Members of the fraternity were eventually prosecuted for their role in Andrew Coffey's death, with three former fraternity leaders awaiting trial as of December 2018[needs update].\nAndrew Coffey, a junior who transferred to FSU to study civil engineering, was a prospective member of Pi Kappa Phi\u2014commonly referred to as a pledge. On November 2, the fraternity was hosting \"Big Brother Night\" at an off-campus house. Big Brother Night was intended to celebrate pledges becoming mentored by their sponsors, and it was typically a night of heavy drinking for the fraternity. At the time, the fraternity was under a liquor ban, but fraternity members told pledges that the liquor ban was lifted specifically for Big Brother Night.[1][2] The fraternity's Executive Council arranged for rideshare vehicles to take fraternity members and pledges from the fraternity house to an off-campus location. The arrangement was meant to circumvent university policies and national chapter policies regarding alcohol.[citation needed]\nAt some point during the party, Coffey was given a bottle of Wild Turkey bourbon and was coerced into drinking it all in a tradition known as \"the family bottle.\"[3][4][2] Court records said that while pledges were not physically forced into drinking, \"it is clear the environment created by the leaders and fraternity members led to an expectation of abusive drinking or the pledges would face ostracism by the group.\"[2] He drank enough that he passed out.[1][4]\n"

        "paragraph": "The Flat-Tire murders were a series of unsolved murders in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties, Florida, occurring between February 1975 and January 1976. The name originated from the investigators' belief that, when the offender committed two of the murders, he had deflated the tires of the victims' cars. The list of suspected victims ultimately included 12 girls and women whose bodies were discovered in or near South Florida canals.[1] Some forensic experts have questioned whether a single offender was responsible for all the murders, while others have proclaimed that the murderer might have killed more than 30 women in multiple states.[2] The murders were the subject of a 2021 book, The Flat Tire Murders: Unsolved Crimes of a South Florida Serial Killer.\nThe first murder victim of the Flat-Tire murderer was 27-year-old respiratory therapist Ronnie Sue Gorlin, who went missing on July 22, 1975 after leaving her Miami Beach apartment to visit her mother at Parkway Hospital.[3] The next day, her naked body was found in the Graham Canal, with signs that she had been sexually assaulted and then stabbed to death. Her car, a rented burgundy-white Oldsmobile Cutlass, was found in a shopping center parking lot with a slashed tire.[4] Eight days later, 21-year-old Elyse Rapp, originally from New York City, left her apartment to go shopping, and was last seen at a Hollywood mall in the evening before vanishing. Her car, a rented yellow Chevrolet Vega, was found in the mall's parking lot, also with a deflated tire. The day after, Rapp's body was found in the same canal where Gorlin's body was found earlier.[3] Both women shared the characteristics of being found naked, except for a necklace with the Hebrew inscription for \"life\" around Rapp's neck and a single sandal on one of Gorlin's feet.[5] Following a forensic autopsy, it was determined that Rapp's cause of death was drowning, but she had been sexually assaulted prior to her death. In both of these cases, the killer had chosen young women who traveled in cars by themselves. In their absence, he had deflated their vehicles' tires, after which he waited for them to return and then offered to fix their tires, presenting himself as a good samaritan.[5]\nAfter the discovery of Gorlin and Rapp's bodies, the police first suggested that there was a serial killer active in two counties. According to them, a total of 12 young women killed in South Florida might've been victims of the same offender. The first of them was 20-year-old Judith Ann Oesterling, from Indiana, who went missing on February 1, 1975 from Miami-Dade County after returning home from her job at a massage parlor. Two days later, her body was found in the canal bordering Broward and Miami-Dade. A few days after that, not far from where Oesterling was found, the body of 17-year-old divorcee Arietta Tinker was found in the canal.[6]\n"

A native of Toronto, he earned a J.D. degree from Harvard in 2001 and after working briefly as a law clerk and junior associate at a law firm, joined the faculty of Florida State University in 2005.\nMarkel was murdered in Tallahassee, Florida, in 2014, in a murder for hire motivated by child custody issues following Markel's divorce from Wendi Adelson, a clinical law professor and child advocate also employed at Florida State University at the time.[1][2][3] Wendi Adelson has not been charged,[4] but she has been named, together with her brother Charlie and mother Donna, as \"conspirators\" in the killing. So far, four individuals have been charged: Luis Rivera pled guilty to murder, and was sentenced to 19 years in jail. Sigfredo Garcia was found guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder, and sentenced to life in prison. Katherine Magbanua was found guilty of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation of murder, in a retrial following a mistrial in her original case, and was sentenced to life in prison plus two consecutive 30-year sentences.[5] Charlie Adelson (Wendi Adelson's brother) has been arrested and charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and solicitation of murder, but has not yet been tried. Jury selection will begin April 24, 2023, and evidence will be heard May 1. The trial is tentatively slated to last three weeks. \n"

Circumstantial evidence was collected against him, but nothing directly linked him to the crime. When the news got out about his arrest, white lynch mobs began to form.[2] In order to keep Neal safe, County Sheriff Flake Chambliss moved him between multiple jails, including the county jail at Brewton, Alabama, 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away. But a lynch mob of about 100 white men from Jackson County heard where he was, and brought him back to Jackson County.[3]\nThe time and place of the lynching were provided to the news media in advance and reported on nationwide, attracting a huge crowd.[4]:\u200a126\u200a The spectacle lynching had been announced to take place at the Cannady farm, but the crowd had grown unruly, and a smaller group murdered Neal in secret. He was tortured and mutilated before being hanged by the instigators at a site along the Chattahoochee River, near Greenwood, Florida. They tied his body to the back of their truck and dragged his corpse to the Cannady farm, where a white crowd estimated at 2,000 attacked the corpse by stabbing it with sticks and knives.[2] Later that night Neal's body was hanged from a tree in the courthouse square. When the sheriff discovered it in the morning, he cut it down.[3][5]\nA large group of white people went to the courthouse in Marianna, demanding that the body be hanged again so they could see it. When the sheriff refused, they began rioting, assaulting the courthouse, attacking black people in the area, injuring 200, and looting and burning houses. The body was displayed on the courthouse steps so that anyone interested could see it.[4]\n"

Prior to Owens' case, sentences of this severity had not been imposed in the South on white men accused of raping black women.[2] For example, in the case of Recy Taylor, who was gang-raped by six white men in Alabama, the men were never found guilty of any charges and released from jail with minimal fines.[3]\nOn May 2, 1959, four white men, William Collinsworth, Ollie Stoutamire, Patrick Scarborough, and David Beagles, set out together to find a woman to sexually assault. They approached a car at Jake Gaither Park armed with shotguns and switchblades. Patrick Scarborough pressed his shotgun against the African American driver's nose and ordered the occupants out of the car.[4] Four African Americans stepped out of the car, two men and two women. All four people in the car were students at Florida A&M University (FAMU). Scarborough forced the two black men to kneel on the ground, and David Beagles held the two black women at knifepoint. Scarborough ordered the black men, Richard Brown and Thomas Butterfield, to leave and they slowly drove away.[5]\nThe two black women left at the hands of the four white men were Edna Richardson and Betty Jean Owens. Edna Richardson broke free of the men and ran into a nearby park, leaving Betty Jean Owens alone with her attackers. Beagles promised to release her only if she did what they wanted her to do.[6] They drove her to the edge of town and subsequently raped her seven times. Edna Richardson and the other two male students were able to make it back to their car and went to the local police station to report what had happened to them. The officer on duty that night was a nineteen-year-old intern, Joseph D. Cooke, Jr.  To the surprise of many people, he called for back up and searched for Owens. The officer spotted the assailant's car and a chase ensued. Eventually, the men pulled their car over and the muffled screams of Owens could be heard from the car. She was bound and gagged on the backseat floorboard.[7]\n"

Members were obligated to actively seek jury service in matters involving other members, assist in the escape of members who were incarcerated, and ultimately, murder those individuals opposed by the group.[4] The group was organized by Alfred Bidwell and Dr. Leonard Andrews, who referred to themselves as \"judges,\" while members Jason Alford, \"captain,\" Louis Cato and Charles Willard, \"lieutenants,\" constituted the remaining command structure of the organization.[5]\nNotoriety for the Sarasota Vigilance Committee came with the murders of Charles E.

By the time the police arrived, Barnes was already dead. It was discovered that Barnes had been beaten to death with a blunt object. After a thorough search of the rest of the apartment, police found the beaten and broken, yet alive, body of Barnes\u2019 girlfriend, Timwanika Lumpkins, pinned between the bed and the wall. She later died in the hospital.[3][4]\nAfter seventeen days of investigation, it was concluded that Lumpkins\u2019 ex-boyfriend,  Labrant Dennis, had entered the apartment after slashing the tires on Little's car. After entering the apartment, Dennis proceeded to beat Barnes twenty-two times with the butt of a shotgun. When he was done with Barnes, he turned on Lumpkins, doing the same to her as he did to Barnes.[3] Dennis was sentenced to the death penalty[5] and, as of 2018[update], was still on death row.[6]\n"

The murder has been alleged to be in connection with the sale of his company, SunCruz Casinos.[1]\nBoulis was born in Kavala, a city in northern Greece. During his childhood, he was known as \"Kostas\". Each day after finishing school, he would run to the shore to wait for his father's boat. His father was a fisherman, and he was the third of four children. Boulis wanted to move away from his home country as he found it difficult to deal with the death of his brother Panagiotis \"Peter\" Boulis, who was fatally electrocuted in an accident. He took classes in ship mechanics at age 16, to prepare himself with skills necessary for a future in the United States. In July 1971, while at a dry-cleaning store, he met the sixteen year old receptionist Efrosini \"Frances\" Boulis, who also originated from Kavala. The day that they met, Boulis was detained as an illegal migrant. One week later, they were married. Their marriage automatically granted Boulis a Canadian citizenship. Within the space of four years from their marriage, they had raised two sons; Christos and Panagiotis.[2] Frances stayed in Greece raising their two sons while Boulis developed his multiple businesses and holding companies in North America.[2] Within days of arriving in Florida, Gus Boulis had met Margaret Hren, an 18-year-old employee originating from Minnesota. Hren agreed to assist Boulis in launching a restaurant business after obtaining a $50,000 loan from a Canadian bank. The couple renovated a dilapidated restaurant in Key West. Two years later, Boulis constructed his first hotel, the \"Marriott Key Largo Beach Resort\" obtaining the startup funds from a $2.5 million overdraft from a local bank.[3] Eventually Boulis and Hren had two sons. Frances remained in Greece and filed for a divorce and half of his assets.[4] Boulis was known for being a tireless hard worker who did whatever it takes to drive his many businesses to success and perfection. He usually wore polo or dress shirts, jeans, or tuxedos. Boulis enjoyed soccer, supporting the Olympiacos FC fanatically, and travelling in his private jet to attend their games. He stood at 174\u00a0cm, had blonde hair and blue eyes. Gus Boulis was known by the local Greek community as a generous and caring person, always willing to help out anybody in need with loans or business ventures.[2] Over 300 people attended his funeral, at the St George Greek Orthodox Church in Hollywood. Attendees were seen crying in the masses, and kissing his face. Many positive speeches and comments about Gus Boulis were made. Mayor Mara Giulianti attended his funeral as well.[5]\nBoulis was born in a fishing village of Kavala in Macedonia. He stayed in school only until the sixth grade to work as a fisherman and then trained as a mechanic.[6] Upon leaving school, he went to work for his father. Boulis joined the merchant marines in 1968 against his father's wishes. He would later jump ship in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, to avoid compulsory military service before moving off to Toronto, Ontario.[7] Boulis started off as a fisherman before taking a job as a dishwasher at a Mr. Submarine sandwich chain. The original owners of Mr. Submarine, now known as Mr. Sub, were Jack Levinson and Earl Linzon. It was Gus Boulis who showed Levinson and Linzon how to franchise. He soon was offered control of one of the stores, and shares in the corporation.[8][9] In his five years with the company Boulis developed a chain of over 200 stores. The sale of the Boulis's shares in the company in the mid-1970s made Boulis a multimillionaire at 25.\n"

Partly for this reason, Joseph Brucia, the child's father, approved making the law in her name, although he concedes this law would not have applied to her specific case, since the charges for which Smith was on probation were not the sexual offenses the law would target.\nThe bill failed to pass before the end of the 2004 session.

At least six black people and two white people were killed, but eyewitness accounts suggested a higher death toll of 27 to 150. The town of Rosewood was destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black men in the years before the massacre,[2] including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.[citation needed]\nBefore the massacre, the town of Rosewood had been a quiet, primarily black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been assaulted by a black drifter. A mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. For several days, survivors from the town hid in nearby swamps until they were evacuated to larger towns by train and car. No arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black and white residents; none of them ever moved back, none of them were ever compensated for the loss of their land, and the town ceased to exist.\nAlthough the rioting was widely reported around the United States at the time, few official records documented the event. The survivors, their descendants, and the perpetrators all remained silent about Rosewood for decades. Sixty years after the rioting, the story of Rosewood was revived by major media outlets when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s. The survivors and their descendants all organized in an attempt to sue the state for failing to protect Rosewood's black community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned a report on the incident. As a result of the findings, Florida compensated the survivors and their descendants for the damages which they had incurred because of racial violence. The incident was the subject of a 1997 feature film which was directed by John Singleton. In 2004, the state designated the site of Rosewood as a Florida Heritage Landmark.\n"

A plaque at her gravesite gives the title \"Princess\", and 1893 as a birthdate; other sources put her birthdate much earlier.[1] Some versions of her early life also say that she experienced visions and voices which encouraged her to go abroad and teach Africans in America.[2] Her detractors in her last years spread rumors that she was born \"Laura Champion\" in Athens, Georgia; but religious history scholar Richard S. Newman compiled evidence to confirm that she was, in fact, Ghanaian by birth.[3]\nKofi moved to North America around 1918, and lived in Detroit for several years. She worked as national field director for Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, touring the deep South and attracting large crowds[4] as a \"prophet\" (in her own estimation), with her base in Jacksonville, Florida.[5] In 1927 she founded the African Universal Church, with herself as its head (\"Warrior Mother of Africa's Warriors of the Most High God\" was her self-chosen title).[1] Garvey soon decided that she was building too much of a following independent of his cause, and announced, \"This woman is a fake and has no authority from me to speak.\"[6] He also encouraged his followers to have her arrested for fraud.[7]\n"

After more than a decade of denials, he confessed to 30 murders committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978. His true victim total is unknown and likely significantly higher.[6]\nBundy was often regarded as charismatic and handsome, traits he exploited to win the trust of both his victims and society as a whole. He would typically approach his victims in public places, either feigning a physical impairment such as an injury, or impersonating an authority figure, before bludgeoning them into unconsciousness and taking them to secondary locations to be raped and strangled. Bundy often revisited his victims, grooming and performing sexual acts with the corpses until decomposition and destruction by wild animals made any further interactions impossible. At least twelve of his victims were decapitated and their severed heads kept as mementos in his apartment. On a few occasions, he broke into homes at night and bludgeoned his victims as they slept.\n"

He told her he felt bad for her situation and had a gift for her, resulting in Sheila giving him directions to the family home. After giving McGirth directions, he and two accomplices, Theodore Houston and Jarrord Marqui Roberts arrived at the house. Within minutes of their arrival, Sheila wheeled herself into her room to smoke a cigarette. McGirth and Houston followed her, then tied her hands, head, and mouth with duct tape. Sheila then watched McGirth shoot Diana Miller, in the chest in her bedroom. Diana fell onto the bed and began coughing up blood. Despite this, Diana insisted she was fine and told Sheila everything would be alright. Afterward, Sheila was abducted by the trio and taken to the Millers' family van.[4] McGirth then returned to the house and shot both Diana and her husband James in the back of the head.

He married Ann Fuller Townsend in 1822 while living in Illinois.[3][6]\nCold weather particularly bothered Perrine after his arsenic poisoning, and in 1824 he moved to Natchez, Mississippi (leaving his family in Illinois) in the hope that the climate would aid his recovery. He began studying herbs and medicinal plants while in Natchez. Malaria was common in the Natchez area, and Perrine began studying the use of quinine to treat it. He published the results of his research in the Philadelphia Journal of the Medical and Physical Sciences in 1826, and that report remained an important source on the subject for a century. In 1825 Perrine and his family moved to his wife Ann's hometown of Sodus, New York. Believing that he needed to move to a climate even warmer than that of Natchez, Perrine had applied in 1824 for a diplomatic position in a tropical country. In 1827 he sent copies of his report on the use of quinine to Washington. Shortly thereafter he was appointed United States Consul in Campeche, Mexico, where he served for ten years.[3][7]\n"

Shakespeare said that he paid Ford $2 for the tickets out of the $5 he had on him that day.[3]\nFord later approached Shakespeare demanding a share of the jackpot of no less than $1 million, which Shakespeare refused to pay, prompting Ford to sue Shakespeare and alleging that Shakespeare stole lottery tickets out of Ford's wallet.[3] The jury did not believe Ford's stolen lottery tickets story and Shakespeare prevailed in the courts. Shakespeare had chosen a one-time, lump sum cash payment of $17 million.[4] He moved out of his working-class neighborhood in Lakeland, Florida and into a gated community.[5] Several months after his lottery win, apart from a $1 million home, his only other major purchases included a Nissan Altima and a Rolex watch from a pawnshop.[6] By late January 2010 the sheriff involved in the investigation of Shakespeare's disappearance told AP that the lottery money \"is gone now.\"[7]\n"

Whites killed four black men, including Charles Wright, who was lynched by being burned at the stake, and they also destroyed several buildings in the black community of Perry after the murder of Ruby Hendry, a white female schoolteacher.[1] [2]\nThe body of a young white woman, Annie \"Ruby\" Hendry, was found with her throat slashed, lying in a pool of blood, at 4:40\u00a0p.m. on December 2, 1922, in Perry in Taylor County, Florida. Her face was badly disfigured from having been beaten with a blunt instrument, so it took half an hour to determine her identity. On December 5, the police had linked the murder weapons found at the scene, a double-barrelled shotgun and a bloody razor, to a black man who had been residing in the area and using the name \"Charley Wright\". He was determined to be an escaped convict from adjacent Dixie County. [3] Search parties with guns and bloodhounds were everywhere.[4] Each night after the body was found, buildings serving the black community in Perry were burnt down: schoolhouse, lodge, amusement hall, and then the church.\nAuthorities deputized local citizens and the roads were sealed. On December 6, Cubrit Dixon, a black man coming from Madison County into Taylor County, was stopped and told to put his hands up by armed citizens who had been deputized. Dixon was shot and killed when he did not comply, and witnesses said he had seemed to be reaching for a gun in his back pocket. Examination of his body found only a closed pocketknife in his back pocket.[5]\n"

An estimated 200 Ku Klux Klan members stormed the popular LGBT-serving nightclub, patrons were ordered to leave and the nightclub was shut down for the evening.[1]\nMiami had recently begun to shift to cater to tourists. Local businesses intended to draw tourist money by offering Miami as a more modern alternative to Havana. To cater to tourists, many local businesses expected a relaxed approach from the vice police to gambling, and more acceptance of foreigners. Some grew frustrated with Miami's new tourism-based economy and began an anti-vice crusade. These included  construction workers affected by business failings in the area. This crusade began during Prohibition and led to the revitalization of the Ku Klux Klan in the Miami area.[2]\nLa Paloma nightclub's performance offerings included early drag queens known as \"female impersonators\" singing and telling jokes, women stripping. It was generally understood to cater specifically to LGBT patrons. Many locals called it indecent. Club owner Al Youst had already been arrested six times, but to many residents it seemed that the arrests would not shut the club down.[2]\n"

During the gun battle which ensued, Platt in particular was able to repeatedly return fire despite sustaining multiple hits. Two Special Agents died from their wounds, while five other agents were injured by gunfire. The shootout ended when both Matix and Platt were killed.\nThe incident is infamous as one of the most violent episodes in the history of the FBI and is often studied in law enforcement training.

Normally, children with a Seminole father and a black mother would not have belonged to any clan, a distinct disadvantage in Seminole society. The last three African women among the Seminoles were adopted into the clan system. Nagey Nancy was owned by the Snake clan, and her two children by Seminole fathers, Jim Jumper and Nancy, were designated as belonging to the Little Black Snake Clan.[1]\nThe Snake clan, along with other Seminole clans, had lived on Fisheating Creek west of Lake Okeechobee for many years after the Third Seminole War, but in the 1880s a white cattleman bought their herds on the condition that the Seminoles move away.

The gunman, who was the subject of the warrant, was later found dead after barricading himself inside the apartment. The incident was one of the deadliest in the FBI's history.\nAt 6:04\u00a0a.m., FBI agents investigating a child exploitation case served a federal warrant at the Water Terrace apartment complex, located in an upscale gated community in Sunrise, 11 miles (18\u00a0km) outside of Fort Lauderdale. They were seeking a computer and other evidence for the case. The agents were being backed up by officers with the Sunrise Police Department. As the agents were about to execute the warrant, the subject of their warrant, who had reportedly seen them coming through a doorbell camera, began firing at them with a rifle. Five agents were struck, two of them fatally, prompting a massive law enforcement response, including the SWAT team from the Broward County Sheriff's Office. One of the fatally wounded agents, Daniel Alfin, managed to return fire, despite being shot multiple times. The other deceased agent, Laura Schwartzenberger, was killed instantly.[3] The gunman, who was wounded in the exchange, then barricaded himself inside the home for several hours and was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.[1][4][5][6][7][8] Witnesses calling 9-1-1 reported hearing multiple gunshots in the apartment complex.[9]\n"

He divorced Shauna after the poisoning of their infant daughter. \"The time that these poisonings occurred, I had been out of the home already for six months and I was working six days a week, 10 hours a day,\" Bill said in 2019. \"On the several visits to the emergency room, I was scratching my head thinking, my gosh.

Annie Taylor alleged on Dr. Phil that she had been given unprescribed insulin in glasses of milk by Shauna when she was a child, with no medical advice from a doctor or nurse. Annie had also had two spinal taps, seemingly for no apparent recorded medical reason. Josh Taylor reported children, including himself, being put in dog cages as a form of humiliation while Shauna shouted profanities at them, being force-fed milk and money (metal coins that he would be made to swallow whole), and forcibly drugged with various over the counter and prescription medications. Shauna reportedly had an obsessive fixation on injuring the livers of her children and would damage their internal organs with repeated drugging and beatings. Annie and Josh reported that they continued to suffer the effects of this abuse into adulthood.[8][9] These allegations made on Dr. Phil were later verified by ABC News, which revealed that Shauna's parental rights to the children had long-since been terminated.[10]\n"

The riot highlighted the racial divide that existed in the United States and the discrimination they faced as soldiers.\nIn the aftermath of the Civil War, Congress, in its reorganization of the U.S. military, mandated that two of the six cavalry regiments and four of its forty-five infantry regiments be made of African Americans. This was how the Ninth and Tenth U.S. Cavalry and the Thirty-eighth, Thirty-ninth, Fortieth, and Forty-first Infantry came into being.[2] In 1869 however, the four African American infantry regiments were reorganized into the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Infantry regiments, the same two regiments that would be at the center of the Tampa Riot. From the outsets, the soldiers in these regiments were ostracized from the regular army with many white officers refusing to serve with African American soldiers.[3] This refusal came in part due to the racist perception that African Americans did not make good soldiers. This notion would be disproved on the battlefield, and even as fresh recruits, the soldiers in these regiments gained a reputation for coolness under fire and an indomitable fighting spirit.[4] For the next two decades, these regiments found themselves at the forefront of numerous conflicts against Native Americans, and their fighting prowess earned them the respect of not only Native Americans but also among white soldiers. The Army and Navy Journal even declared that the comradery between white and black soldiers signaled an end to prejudice against blacks in the regular army.[5] When war broke out between Spain and the United States, the Buffalo Soldiers \"were among the first units dispatched to southern camps in preparation for the invasion of Cuba.\"[6]\nThe four units that arrived in Tampa were confronted with the discrimination of the Jim Crow South. The Tampa press was especially critical of the black soldiers, and frequently published stories painting them as undisciplined and riotous. The Tampa Daily Tribune revealed the true reason the citizens of Tampa resented the black soldiers, stating: \"The men insist upon being treated as white men are treated and the citizens will not make any distinction between the colored troops and the colored civilians.\"[7] For these soldiers who had fought with distinction on the frontier, they were appalled by the Tampa resident's efforts to demonize them and resisted efforts by the residents to enforce the practice of segregation practices that had arisen in the South.[8] Resentment toward the black soldiers was not limited to civilians. White soldiers expressed regular vitriol about the ability of black soldiers to exercise authority over them and lunged numerous racial epithets at them.[9] Through the summer of 1898, the black soldiers displayed restraint against those who insulted them, but it was clear that tensions were rising.\n"

In Key West, he was known as \"Isleno,\" the Islander, and during World War I, he served as a private in Company B of the 105th Engineers.[1] After he was ordered to report for military service during WWI, Cabeza trained at Camp Jackson, he was assigned the service number 1873913 and on the ship Talthybius, he departed for France as a Private in Company B, 105th Engineers. His unit often came under fire while it was building railways and bridges. During fierce fighting, his unit was pushed back against a river, he was part of a group of volunteers that swam across the river with a rope so the other members of his unit could cross it. He left Europe on April 1, 1919, on the USS Martha Washington and he was honorably discharged later that same year.[1]\nDuring Prohibition, Cabeza illegally operated the Red Rooster, a bar, a coffee shop and a sporting club. It was located on Thomas Street near the waterfront. While he was operating the Red Rooster, he openly lived with a black woman who was named Angela. This interracial relationship did not sit well in the Jim Crow South, and his dealing in liquor put him outside the law. On December 23, 1921, a group of hooded men loaded five cars, kidnapped Manuel Cabeza, beat him half to death, and Tarred and feathered him.[3] Cabeza recognized two of the kidnappers and hunted them down the next day.\n"

At least six black people and two white people were killed, but eyewitness accounts suggested a higher death toll of 27 to 150. The town of Rosewood was destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot. Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black men in the years before the massacre,[2] including a well-publicized incident in December 1922.[citation needed]\nBefore the massacre, the town of Rosewood had been a quiet, primarily black, self-sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway. Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been assaulted by a black drifter. A mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people and burned almost every structure in Rosewood. For several days, survivors from the town hid in nearby swamps until they were evacuated to larger towns by train and car. No arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood. The town was abandoned by its former black and white residents; none of them ever moved back, none of them were ever compensated for the loss of their land, and the town ceased to exist.\nAlthough the rioting was widely reported around the United States at the time, few official records documented the event. The survivors, their descendants, and the perpetrators all remained silent about Rosewood for decades. Sixty years after the rioting, the story of Rosewood was revived by major media outlets when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s. The survivors and their descendants all organized in an attempt to sue the state for failing to protect Rosewood's black community. In 1993, the Florida Legislature commissioned a report on the incident. As a result of the findings, Florida compensated the survivors and their descendants for the damages which they had incurred because of racial violence. The incident was the subject of a 1997 feature film which was directed by John Singleton. In 2004, the state designated the site of Rosewood as a Florida Heritage Landmark.\n"

Whites killed four black men, including Charles Wright, who was lynched by being burned at the stake, and they also destroyed several buildings in the black community of Perry after the murder of Ruby Hendry, a white female schoolteacher.[1] [2]\nThe body of a young white woman, Annie \"Ruby\" Hendry, was found with her throat slashed, lying in a pool of blood, at 4:40\u00a0p.m. on December 2, 1922, in Perry in Taylor County, Florida. Her face was badly disfigured from having been beaten with a blunt instrument, so it took half an hour to determine her identity. On December 5, the police had linked the murder weapons found at the scene, a double-barrelled shotgun and a bloody razor, to a black man who had been residing in the area and using the name \"Charley Wright\". He was determined to be an escaped convict from adjacent Dixie County. [3] Search parties with guns and bloodhounds were everywhere.[4] Each night after the body was found, buildings serving the black community in Perry were burnt down: schoolhouse, lodge, amusement hall, and then the church.\nAuthorities deputized local citizens and the roads were sealed. On December 6, Cubrit Dixon, a black man coming from Madison County into Taylor County, was stopped and told to put his hands up by armed citizens who had been deputized. Dixon was shot and killed when he did not comply, and witnesses said he had seemed to be reaching for a gun in his back pocket. Examination of his body found only a closed pocketknife in his back pocket.[5]\n"

October 26, 1934) was a 23-year-old African-American farmhand who was arrested in Jackson County, Florida, on October 19, 1934, for allegedly raping and killing Lola Cannady, a 19-year-old white woman missing since the preceding night. Circumstantial evidence was collected against him, but nothing directly linked him to the crime. When the news got out about his arrest, white lynch mobs began to form.[2] In order to keep Neal safe, County Sheriff Flake Chambliss moved him between multiple jails, including the county jail at Brewton, Alabama, 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away. But a lynch mob of about 100 white men from Jackson County heard where he was, and brought him back to Jackson County.[3]\nThe time and place of the lynching were provided to the news media in advance and reported on nationwide, attracting a huge crowd.[4]:\u200a126\u200a The spectacle lynching had been announced to take place at the Cannady farm, but the crowd had grown unruly, and a smaller group murdered Neal in secret. He was tortured and mutilated before being hanged by the instigators at a site along the Chattahoochee River, near Greenwood, Florida. They tied his body to the back of their truck and dragged his corpse to the Cannady farm, where a white crowd estimated at 2,000 attacked the corpse by stabbing it with sticks and knives.[2] Later that night Neal's body was hanged from a tree in the courthouse square. When the sheriff discovered it in the morning, he cut it down.[3][5]\nA large group of white people went to the courthouse in Marianna, demanding that the body be hanged again so they could see it. When the sheriff refused, they began rioting, assaulting the courthouse, attacking black people in the area, injuring 200, and looting and burning houses. The body was displayed on the courthouse steps so that anyone interested could see it.[4]\n"

Other African Americans living in southern Ocoee were later killed or driven out of town by the threat of further violence being used against them. Thus, Ocoee essentially became an all-white or \"sundown\" town. The massacre has been described as the \"single bloodiest day in modern American political history\".[2]\nThe attack was intended to prevent black citizens from voting. Black people had essentially been disenfranchised in Florida since the beginning of the 20th century. In Ocoee and across the state, various black organizations had been conducting voter registration drives for a year.\n"

Her face was badly disfigured from having been beaten with a blunt instrument, so it took half an hour to determine her identity. On December 5, the police had linked the murder weapons found at the scene, a double-barrelled shotgun and a bloody razor, to a black man who had been residing in the area and using the name \"Charley Wright\". He was determined to be an escaped convict from adjacent Dixie County. [3] Search parties with guns and bloodhounds were everywhere.[4] Each night after the body was found, buildings serving the black community in Perry were burnt down: schoolhouse, lodge, amusement hall, and then the church.\nAuthorities deputized local citizens and the roads were sealed. On December 6, Cubrit Dixon, a black man coming from Madison County into Taylor County, was stopped and told to put his hands up by armed citizens who had been deputized. Dixon was shot and killed when he did not comply, and witnesses said he had seemed to be reaching for a gun in his back pocket. Examination of his body found only a closed pocketknife in his back pocket.[5]\n"

His unit often came under fire while it was building railways and bridges. During fierce fighting, his unit was pushed back against a river, he was part of a group of volunteers that swam across the river with a rope so the other members of his unit could cross it. He left Europe on April 1, 1919, on the USS Martha Washington and he was honorably discharged later that same year.[1]\nDuring Prohibition, Cabeza illegally operated the Red Rooster, a bar, a coffee shop and a sporting club. It was located on Thomas Street near the waterfront. While he was operating the Red Rooster, he openly lived with a black woman who was named Angela. This interracial relationship did not sit well in the Jim Crow South, and his dealing in liquor put him outside the law. On December 23, 1921, a group of hooded men loaded five cars, kidnapped Manuel Cabeza, beat him half to death, and Tarred and feathered him.[3] Cabeza recognized two of the kidnappers and hunted them down the next day.\n"

Williams, Cellos Harrison, Willie James Howard, and Jesse James Payne.[1] Hobbs argues World War II shifted public opinion and behavior in the United States, leading to private mob violence against African Americans instead of public lynchings, and to what Hobbs describes as \"legal lynchings.\"[1]\nIn a review for The Journal of American History, W. Fitzhugh Brundage writes \"Tameka Bradley Hobbs makes a convincing argument that these lynchings reveal important insights into the evolution of white supremacy in twentieth-century America.\"[2] In a review for the Journal of Southern History, Mari N. Crabtree writes that Hobbs \"provides valuable insights into the devastating impact of lynching on African American families and communities over the past seventy-five years. With so much of the literature on lynching focused on white southerners, her interviews with African American survivors provide a poignant and, at times, gut-wrenching glimpse into the intergenerational trauma of lynching.\"[1]\n"

When the news got out about his arrest, white lynch mobs began to form.[2] In order to keep Neal safe, County Sheriff Flake Chambliss moved him between multiple jails, including the county jail at Brewton, Alabama, 100 miles (160\u00a0km) away. But a lynch mob of about 100 white men from Jackson County heard where he was, and brought him back to Jackson County.[3]\nThe time and place of the lynching were provided to the news media in advance and reported on nationwide, attracting a huge crowd.[4]:\u200a126\u200a The spectacle lynching had been announced to take place at the Cannady farm, but the crowd had grown unruly, and a smaller group murdered Neal in secret. He was tortured and mutilated before being hanged by the instigators at a site along the Chattahoochee River, near Greenwood, Florida. They tied his body to the back of their truck and dragged his corpse to the Cannady farm, where a white crowd estimated at 2,000 attacked the corpse by stabbing it with sticks and knives.[2] Later that night Neal's body was hanged from a tree in the courthouse square. When the sheriff discovered it in the morning, he cut it down.[3][5]\nA large group of white people went to the courthouse in Marianna, demanding that the body be hanged again so they could see it. When the sheriff refused, they began rioting, assaulting the courthouse, attacking black people in the area, injuring 200, and looting and burning houses. The body was displayed on the courthouse steps so that anyone interested could see it.[4]\n"

Victorino was able to further motivate his accomplices by pointing out that the attack would likely allow them to kill another person they were mad at, but that person happened not to be at the house that night.[5]\nA jury found Troy Victorino, Robert Cannon, Jerone Hunter, and Michael Salas guilty of the massacre in August 2006.

The gunman, who was the subject of the warrant, was later found dead after barricading himself inside the apartment. The incident was one of the deadliest in the FBI's history.\nAt 6:04\u00a0a.m., FBI agents investigating a child exploitation case served a federal warrant at the Water Terrace apartment complex, located in an upscale gated community in Sunrise, 11 miles (18\u00a0km) outside of Fort Lauderdale. They were seeking a computer and other evidence for the case. The agents were being backed up by officers with the Sunrise Police Department. As the agents were about to execute the warrant, the subject of their warrant, who had reportedly seen them coming through a doorbell camera, began firing at them with a rifle. Five agents were struck, two of them fatally, prompting a massive law enforcement response, including the SWAT team from the Broward County Sheriff's Office. One of the fatally wounded agents, Daniel Alfin, managed to return fire, despite being shot multiple times. The other deceased agent, Laura Schwartzenberger, was killed instantly.[3] The gunman, who was wounded in the exchange, then barricaded himself inside the home for several hours and was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.[1][4][5][6][7][8] Witnesses calling 9-1-1 reported hearing multiple gunshots in the apartment complex.[9]\n"

The anthology is curated by writers Renee Bess and Lee Lynch and contains contributions from LGBT writers from all walks of life. The anthology was created to give LGBTQ writers a chance to reflect upon the role of the gay bar in their lives and to express its importance to non-LGBTQ people.[1]\nThe massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida brought LGBT club life into the public view. However, it became apparent that many people outside of the LGBTQ community did not truly understand the role that bars and clubs play in the community and how their importance evolved over the years.[2]\nWhen writer Renee Bess read Lee Lynch's blog, \"Freedom Clothes\", she noticed the historical descriptions of gay bar life mirrored the contemporary descriptions of the gay bar's role in the lives of LGBTQ persons. Despite the commonly accepted belief that the gay bar is a place of refuge and self-affirmation, it is also a place that offers different experiences to different members of the LGBTQ community. Bess felt it was important to have a discussion about the significance of the gay bar/club in LGBTQ culture. The idea of inviting writers to contribute their pieces of short fiction, slices of their bar-related memoirs, and their poetry to an anthology came to mind as a means of sharing the LGBTQ club experience with the world.[2][3]\n"

During that period, he was placed on the Terrorist Screening Database, but was subsequently removed.[4] In a call to 9-1-1 during the shooting, Mateen identified himself as \"Mujahideen\", \"Islamic Soldier\", and \"Soldier of God\";[5][6] and pledged his allegiance multiple times to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who at the time was the leader of the militant jihadist group ISIL.[7] He said the shooting was \"triggered\" by an airstrike in Iraq that killed Abu Wahib, an ISIL commander, six weeks before.[8]\n"

The anthology is curated by writers Renee Bess and Lee Lynch and contains contributions from LGBT writers from all walks of life. The anthology was created to give LGBTQ writers a chance to reflect upon the role of the gay bar in their lives and to express its importance to non-LGBTQ people.[1]\nThe massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida brought LGBT club life into the public view. However, it became apparent that many people outside of the LGBTQ community did not truly understand the role that bars and clubs play in the community and how their importance evolved over the years.[2]\nWhen writer Renee Bess read Lee Lynch's blog, \"Freedom Clothes\", she noticed the historical descriptions of gay bar life mirrored the contemporary descriptions of the gay bar's role in the lives of LGBTQ persons. Despite the commonly accepted belief that the gay bar is a place of refuge and self-affirmation, it is also a place that offers different experiences to different members of the LGBTQ community. Bess felt it was important to have a discussion about the significance of the gay bar/club in LGBTQ culture. The idea of inviting writers to contribute their pieces of short fiction, slices of their bar-related memoirs, and their poetry to an anthology came to mind as a means of sharing the LGBTQ club experience with the world.[2][3]\n"

It was the deadliest shooting by a single shooter in United States history until the Las Vegas Strip shooting on October 1, 2017.\nBorn in New York to Afghan-American parents, he moved to Florida as a child, where he displayed an interest in violence and had behavioral problems in school, including struggling academically and receiving numerous suspensions.[2] As an adult he drifted through various jobs and a failed marriage before eventually becoming a security guard by profession.[3] Before the shooting, he had been investigated for connections to terrorism by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2013 and 2014. During that period, he was placed on the Terrorist Screening Database, but was subsequently removed.[4] In a call to 9-1-1 during the shooting, Mateen identified himself as \"Mujahideen\", \"Islamic Soldier\", and \"Soldier of God\";[5][6] and pledged his allegiance multiple times to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who at the time was the leader of the militant jihadist group ISIL.[7] He said the shooting was \"triggered\" by an airstrike in Iraq that killed Abu Wahib, an ISIL commander, six weeks before.[8]\n"

The video was reminiscent of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting and was criticized by the media and the survivors of the massacre. However, it was praised by some gun control advocates.

The riot was caused by the shooting death of an African American man in the city's Overtown neighborhood by a Latino police officer on December 28, leading to three days of disorder that resulted in one additional death, numerous injuries and arrests, and widespread property damage.\nIn the early 1980s, many black neighborhoods in Miami were experiencing issues such as high unemployment rates, poor living conditions, and widespread illicit drug usage. Additionally, tensions were high between the black community and the Miami Police Department (MPD) over several incidents of police brutality, culminating in the highly destructive 1980 Miami riots following the death of an African American man by several police officers. Also during this time, Miami was undergoing a change in demographics due to increased immigration from Latin America, with some black civic leaders viewing the changes as hurting the established African American community. By 1982, Hispanic American officers outnumbered African Americans in the MPD, and a majority of the Miami City Commission, which included Miami Mayor Maurice Ferr\u00e9. \n"

Lozano was on foot investigating an unrelated incident, heard about the situation on his police radio and later stated the motorcycle \"veered toward him\".

Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24, died the following day from his injuries. Several Black witnesses stated that Lozano walked almost to the center of the street with his handgun and poised ready to shoot for several seconds as the motorcyle approached.[2] Rioting began almost immediately after the shooting in Overtown,[3][2] and on the following day in Liberty City, both predominantly Black neighborhoods of Miami, and continued until January 19 when the Chicago Bulls including star player Michael Jordan played a scheduled game in Overtown against the Miami Heat, who were in their inaugural season.[2][4] Schools were closed and police cordoned off a 130-block area and teargassed rioting crowds.[1]\n"

An estimated 200 Ku Klux Klan members stormed the popular LGBT-serving nightclub, patrons were ordered to leave and the nightclub was shut down for the evening.[1]\nMiami had recently begun to shift to cater to tourists. Local businesses intended to draw tourist money by offering Miami as a more modern alternative to Havana. To cater to tourists, many local businesses expected a relaxed approach from the vice police to gambling, and more acceptance of foreigners. Some grew frustrated with Miami's new tourism-based economy and began an anti-vice crusade. These included  construction workers affected by business failings in the area. This crusade began during Prohibition and led to the revitalization of the Ku Klux Klan in the Miami area.[2]\nLa Paloma nightclub's performance offerings included early drag queens known as \"female impersonators\" singing and telling jokes, women stripping. It was generally understood to cater specifically to LGBT patrons. Many locals called it indecent. Club owner Al Youst had already been arrested six times, but to many residents it seemed that the arrests would not shut the club down.[2]\n"

After desegregation, much of the racial violence in Miami had calmed only to be reignited by the 1980s.[1] The decade of riots were the result of policing controversies and ethnic tensions fueled by the perceived threat of recent immigrants to African Americans on the Miami job market.[2]\nIn the United States through the 1960s, desegregation was empowering once disadvantaged African American communities to reach new political and economic gains. In Miami the Cuban exile seemed to undercut new African American gains as Cubans began to compete for jobs, residence, and political power. The later perceived successes of many Cubans gave a feeling of powerlessness to local African Americans. Many Cuban refugees lacked English language skills and ended up living in lower income neighborhoods and taking up blue collar jobs that many African Americans also held. In 1963, Ebony magazine characterized the Cuban exile as an \"invasion\" bringing in \"grave social and economic problems.\"[3]\nBy 1968, Miami witnessed a riot in its Liberty City neighborhood during the 1968 Republican National Convention, caused by the frustration African Americans faced in the country.[4] By the 1970s, the Hispanic population of Miami outnumbered the African American population and more Hispanic owned businesses had been opened than African American owned businesses.[3]\n"

The petition accumulated over 270,000 signatures.[2][3][4] Murdock and fellow Ridgefield students Paul Kim, Max Cumming, and Grant Yaun partnered with Indivisible to successfully rollout the effort.[5][1]\nThe National School Walkout's Twitter account accumulated more than 100,000 followers in five days.[6] National School Walkout scheduled the nation wide walkout to take place on April 20, as it marked the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High school shooting.[2][5] The official color for The National School Walkout was orange, as a nod to the color hunters wear to distinguish fellow hunters from animals.[6]\n"

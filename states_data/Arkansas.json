After killing a man in a restaurant and fleeing, Rector spent three days on the run before he agreed to turn himself in. However, instead of giving himself up, he shot the police officer who had negotiated his surrender in the back. He then shot himself in the head in a suicide attempt. The attempt effectively resulted in a lobotomy.[1]\nA 1991 request for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court was denied, with Justice Thurgood Marshall dissenting.[2] Despite Rector's mental state, then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton made a point of returning to Arkansas to oversee Rector's January 24, 1992, execution during the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign.\nOn March 21, 1981, Rector and some friends drove to a dance hall at Tommy's Old-Fashioned Home-Style Restaurant in Conway. When one friend who could not pay the $3 cover charge was refused entry, Rector became incensed and pulled a .38 caliber pistol from his waist band. He fired several shots, wounding two and killing a third man named Arthur D. Criswell, who died almost instantly after being struck in the throat and forehead.[3]\n",

Franklin was known in the popular press as the \"Arkansas Ghost\".[1]\nIn January 1929, Connie Franklin moved to the town of St. James in Stone County, Arkansas. At the time, he claimed to be 22 years old, and  worked cutting timber and as a farm hand. Soon after his arrival in the area he began courting a local 16-year-old girl, surname Ruminer, whose given name is reported variously as Tillar,[2] Tillir,[3] Tiller,[4] and Tillie.[5] In March 1929, Franklin disappeared. After an investigation, Sheriff Sam Johnson presented Bertha Burns and Tillar Ruminer as his evidence to a grand jury, but as there were at that time no witnesses willing to testify, the Grand Jury took no action in the case.[6]\nIn the fall of 1929 Bertha Burns, who had found the bloody hat that supposedly belonged to Franklin back in the Spring, contacted Johnson and brought him to a pit of ashes not far from her home, claiming that there might be the evidence of Franklin's murder in the pit. Johnson found some bone fragments and teeth, which he took to the Arkansas state health officer, Dr. C. W. Garrison, who determined that at least one of the shards came from a human skull.[6]\n",

After he had shot her, he also shot himself, as law enforcement closed in on the unit.[4] Kacie's case has been featured on the Investigation Discovery documentary shows Web of Lies[5] and Man with a Van,[6] and the podcast Crime Junkie. It is possibly the first well-documented case of a pedophile using the Internet to groom, abduct, and murder a victim.\nSince Kacie's murder, her friends and family founded the Kacie Woody Foundation, which is designed to educate parents and children about dangers associated with the Internet.\n",

During the late 1880s, the Union Labor Party, which was made up of labor and agricultural activists from groups such as the Agricultural Wheel, formed an alliance with the Republican Party and won several elected positions in the county government in the 1888 elections.

In the aftermath, shots were fired by members of both parties, resulting in several deaths. Neely fled the scene and barricaded himself in the offices of his local newspaper, though he was killed by militia members the following day.\n",

Dalton, once a member of California legislature, and later an outlaw and leader of the Doolin Dalton gang alongside Bill Doolin. Frank Dalton is not to be confused with J. Frank Dalton (1848-1951), who made many claims to be famous people, including his claim of being Frank Dalton, and later Jesse James.\nDalton was commissioned as a Deputy US Marshal, serving under Judge Parker, and quickly developed a reputation as being a brave lawman.[1] Based out of Fort Smith, Arkansas, Dalton was involved in a number of shootouts and high risk arrests over a three-year period. However, on November 27, 1887, he and Deputy J.R. Cole were on the trail of outlaw Dave Smith, wanted for horse theft. As they approached Smith's camp, Smith fired a shot from a rifle, hitting Dalton in the chest. Deputy Cole returned fire, killing Smith, but was then shot and wounded by a Smith cohort. Cole was able to make his escape believing Dalton was dead. Dalton, however, was still alive, and engaged the outlaws in a short gunbattle. One of Smith's cohorts was wounded, and a woman who was in the camp was killed during the crossfire. Frank Dalton was shot and killed near the Arkansas River by the time Deputy Cole returned with a posse, having been killed with two additional rifle shots by outlaw Will Towerly.[2] The outlaw wounded by Dalton never revealed his own name. He died shortly thereafter, but not before naming Towerly as Frank Dalton's murderer. A newspaper of the time indicated Dalton had begged Towerly not to kill him, saying he was already dying. However, that was a rumour, and there were no witnesses to the crime who ever made that statement. Towerly was killed one month later by Deputy William Moody and Deputy US Marshal Ed Stokley.[3] Stokley was also killed during the gunfight. Dalton was buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Coffeyville, Kansas, not far from the graves of his two outlaw brothers, Grat and Bob. (One can see the graves of Bob, and Grat just to the left of Frank's grave about 30 yards (27\u00a0m) back with the original hitching post that they tied their horses to) [4]\nThe actor Robert Lansing played Frank Dalton in the NBC television series Outlaws in a two-part episode \"The Daltons Must Die\", which aired early in 1961.[5]\n",

Snell was sentenced to death for one of the murders, and executed by lethal injection in 1995.[1]\nRichard Snell was a member of the white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord (known as the CSA), which was started in 1971 in the small community of Elijah, Missouri, by polygamist James Ellison. He was also a believer in the Christian Identity religion, and frequented Elohim City, a private community located in Oklahoma. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) had ongoing investigations into the organization. By the end of their operations, the ATF obtained 155 Krugerrands (gold coins), one live light antitank rocket (LAW), 94 long guns, 30 handguns, 35 sawed-off shotguns and machine guns, one light machine gun (a Japanese copy of the World War I Lewis, in .303 caliber), and three and a half bars of C-4 explosives.[2] Much of this arsenal had been stolen.[citation needed]\nSnell was involved in the filming of planes that landed at Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport in Mena, Arkansas, thought of by Snell and many conspiracy theorists to be used in a government-sanctioned operation of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to smuggle drugs into the United States. Snell had claimed that law enforcement agencies, both state and those local to that area of western Arkansas, were involved in the cover-up of the Mena airport drug smuggling. He had also made claims that he had filmed the then-Governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, at Mena Intermountain Municipal Airport, but that claim has never been proven. Snell further claimed that one of the Arkansas state troopers assigned to Clinton's security team at that time had beaten Snell's wife in an attempt to force her to reveal the location of the alleged video footage Snell had taken at the airport.\n",

        "paragraph": "\nThe Arkansas Militia in Reconstruction was deeply involved in the ongoing civil disturbances which plagued the state until the late 1870s.  In the immediate aftermath of the Civil War, the militia was first utilized by the white population to re-establish control over the newly freed black population. Radical Republicans seized control in 1867 and abolished existing state governments and militia organizations, and disenfranchised former Confederates. The new disenfranchised whites turned to the shadow Ku Klux Klan to attempt to maintain social order.  The Reconstructionist government raised a new militia, primarily of black soldiers with white officers and utilized this new \"Black militia\" to put down the rising power of the Ku Klux Klan.  Armed conflicts between rival parties continued in several counties and the militia was called to re-establish control in Pope and Scott Counties.  The most severe conflict of this period occurred during the so-called Brooks\u2013Baxter War with rival parties, with supporting militias, battling for control of the governorship.  With the end of reconstruction one of the first acts of the new resurgent Democratic state legislature was to abolish the office of adjutant general in retaliation for the use of the militia to enforce the rule of the Reconstruction government.\nAfter the fall of Little Rock in September 1863, a pro-Union government was established in Federally occupied Arkansas, under Isaac Murphy.  Governor Murphy appointed Albert W. Bishop, former lieutenant colonel of the Union 1st Arkansas Cavalry, as adjutant general.  Murphy and Bishop established a  pro-Union state militia organization.[1] Immediately following the official end of the Civil War in the summer of 1865, white southerners began to repopulate the local militia and insurgent groups. They worked to re-establish white control over the newly freed African Americans. In some areas, white militia groups tried to disarm returning black Union veterans.\n",

He was also convicted of the murders of two teenagers: Greg Becknell and Dorothy Rhodes, in Columbia, South Carolina, and was charged but never convicted of the murder of Jeffrey McNerney in Florida. Swindler was the first person to be executed by the state of Arkansas since 1961, and is the only person to have been executed in the electric chair in Arkansas since the reinstatement of capital punishment in 1976.[1]\nJohn Edward Swindler shot and killed Patrolman Randy Basnett in the afternoon of September 24, 1976. Officer Basnett had stopped at a service station at the Kelly Highway exit in Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Swindler also stopped there in a stolen car with a South Carolina license plate. Swindler was returning to Leavenworth, Kansas to settle some personal grudges that had arisen when he had been imprisoned there. Passing the I-540 exit on I-40 near Van Buren, Arkansas, the illiterate Swindler became confused and exited, driving across the Arkansas River and into Fort Smith. That morning, Basnett had been briefed to be on the lookout for Swindler, who was the suspect in the double murders of teenagers Gregory L. Becknell and Dorothy Ann Rhodes in South Carolina and other felonies in Georgia and South Carolina. The briefing contained information about Swindler's description, the car he was thought to be driving, and the fact that he was considered to be armed and dangerous. After he noted Swindler and the stolen car, Basnett radioed dispatchers that Swindler was at the service station. Back-up officers were immediately dispatched to his location.\nBefore additional help arrived, officer Basnett approached Swindler's car and asked for identification. Without warning, Swindler pulled a revolver and shot Basnett twice in the chest. Basnett, who was standing beside the car, returned fire before collapsing, slightly wounding Swindler. Swindler attempted to flee, but being unfamiliar with Fort Smith, took a road that trailed off into a dead end in a soybean field on the Arkansas River. He was captured there within minutes by police officers who had answered Basnett's call. When officers arrested Swindler, he had several weapons and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his possession. \n",

Her case garnered considerable international media attention in the US and Europe, and spurred debates about child protection in part due to the prior convictions and lengthy sentences for the perpetrators of aggravated child abuse against her, involving a high-profile trial, and the especially heinous nature of that abuse and circumstances surrounding her subsequent abduction and murder.\nJersey Bridgeman was born and grew up in the city of Bentonville, Arkansas, widely known as the seat of the American Walmart retail chain. Following her parents\u2019 divorce, her father and stepmother, David and Jana Bridgeman, began to chain her to a dresser in an apparent bid to stop her from wandering at night, per their statements, getting into medication. The case generated profound public concern and outrage, leading to their incarceration after both pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, permitting abuse, and endangering the welfare of a minor, with David and Jana Bridgeman sentenced to 18 and 12 years in prison, respectively. [1]\nJersey was then placed in her mother DesaRae's custody and was frequently tended to by a neighbor, Zachary Holly (born October 8, 1984),[2] and his wife, who served as babysitters. They tended to Jersey and her younger sister on the night of November 19, 2012, helping her mother to place the girls in bed after she arrived home late from work. The next morning, DesaRae reported that Jersey was missing, calling on the Hollys for help. Later that day, her daughter was found in a vacant home in the same neighborhood; her body was naked, and she had been raped and suffocated, apparently strangled by her pajama bottoms. Holly was questioned in the wake of Jersey's abduction and noted to be cooperative, providing a DNA sample and his clothes from the day of Jersey's disappearance. However, forensic evidence was found to implicate him in the crime, and he was shortly thereafter arrested and arraigned for involvement in Jersey's abduction.[3][4]\n",

The strike led to open conflict between strikers and plantation owners, racially-motivated violence, and both a sheriff's posse and a lynching party.  One plantation manager, two non-striking workers, and some twelve strikers were killed during the incident.[1]  Nine of those strikers were hung in a mass lynching on the evening of September 29.[2]\nIn 1886 the Colored Farmers' National Alliance and Cooperative Union had been founded by R.M. Humphrey, a white Baptist minister, reformer, and member of the parallel white Farmers' Alliance organization.  Early in September 1891, Humphrey called for a national African-American strike of sharecroppers against planters, in response to the planters setting 50-cent-per-100-pound prices at their summer conventions.[3]\nDespite its extensive claimed membership of millions,[4] and despite Humphrey's announcement of 600,000 members firmly committed to strike for $1 per 100 pounds,[5] the strike promoted for September 12 took hold nowhere. Additionally, many landowners who became aware of the planned strike took steps to suppress or outright prevent the strike through increased police presence and pacification tactics such as smaller raises.[6] Its failure was noted and documented with some satisfaction in newspapers across the cotton-growing south.  The one exception was in Lee County, a location with its own history of conflict, on the Mississippi River and across from Memphis, Tennessee. Ben Patterson, a Black labor organizer from Memphis, traveled to Lee County at the beginning of September 1891 and began to organize a strike among local cotton pickers. Patterson's efforts were significantly more successful than those of Humphrey, garnering the support of at least twenty-five pickers in Lee County.[6]\n",

That relatively few of his claims were officially recognized was due to the complex system of verifying air kills used by FARE and the financial incentive paid to mercenaries: many victories were not verifiable because the downed aircraft crashed in an enemy-held area and/or an incentive would not have to be paid.[2] In addition, Tinker and other pilots from Escuadrilla La Calle (\"La Calle's Squadron\"), also known as 1\u00aa Escuadrilla de Chatos (1st Chato Squadron\"), shared a number of joint kills against Junkers Ju 52 bombers.  He reported narrowly avoiding death at both the hands of enemy aviators and malfunctioning equipment.\nHe left a detailed record of his experiences as a fighter pilot for the Republicans in his memoir Some Still Live, published by Funk & Wagnalls Co in New York, 1938[3] and recently republished by The Clapton Press, London.[4]\n",

Originally sentenced to life imprisonment for two murders committed in 1974, Greenawalt later became notorious for escaping together with fellow murderer Gary Tison and his three sons from prison, embarking on a two-week killing spree through Arizona and Colorado that left six people dead in 1978.[2] He was promptly sentenced to death and thereafter executed in 1997, with his case serving as the basis for the Supreme Court decision Tison v. Arizona.[3]\nIn early January 1974, Greenawalt went on a trip down to Miami, Florida, where he planned to exchange his car with a couple from Denver, Colorado.[4] On January 12, the body of 42-year-old Henry A. Weber, a Global Van Lines truck driver who had been shot in the head, was found at a highway rest area in Mississippi County, Arkansas.[4] Initially, nobody could be connected to the crime until four days later, when police officers in Tempe, Arizona detained brothers Randy and James Greenawalt, 25 and 23, respectively, for the January 15 murder of 33-year-old Stanley Edward Sandage at a rest area near Flagstaff.[5] Like Weber, Sandage was a truck driver working for Whitfield Tank Lines who was found shot to death in his tank truck in an apparent robbery, as $42 had been stolen from his wallet.[6]\nThe Greenawalts were arrested for trying to purchase stereo equipment using Sandage's MasterCharge card, and upon inspecting their vehicle, they found a .32-caliber pistol that was positively identified as the murder weapon, and a .243-caliber rifle that might have been the second murder weapon.[5] A third man, 33-year-old George Sanders, an apparent acquaintance of the brothers, was also arrested for federal firearms violations and credit card fraud in relation to the case.[5] Due to the similarity of the two cases, a sheriff from Arkansas was dispatched to question Randy in the earlier killing, but decided to wait until the case in Arizona went first.[4] In a bid to avoid the death penalty, the elder Greenawalt pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment, in exchange for testifying against his brother, who had pleaded innocent on all charges.[7] During the trial, it was made apparent that in the Sandage murder, Randy had pre-emptively painted an \"X\" on the window of the truck before proceeding to open fire and kill his victim.[8] Thanks to his testimony, James was also convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, which he was to spend at the Florence State Prison.[9] In the meantime, Randy  was extradited to face charges in Arkansas, but despite his willing confession to both this and another murder committed in Colorado, the case fell through and he was returned to serve his sentence in Arizona.[8]\n",

He had previously played for Westark Community College before enrolling at Baylor.\nDuring Lambert's recruitment to Baylor, then-assistant coach Gary Thomas had committed a major recruiting violation to acquire him.[2] Thomas had faxed a term paper to Westark assistant basketball coach Troy Drummond on April 5, 1993, which was a slight re-write of an article that had previously appeared in a women's magazine.[2] Lambert then handed the faxed paper in to an English class to pass it off as his own.[2] He ultimately chose to play at Baylor, with Drummond \"coincidentally\" becoming a new assistant coach at that school, and news of this violation did not come out until after the 1993\u201394 season, the season in which Lambert's 14.8\u00a0rebounds per game led the NCAA.[1][2] He also garnered many accolades that season, including First Team All-Southwest Conference\u00a0(SWC), SWC Newcomer of the Year, SWC All-Newcomer Team, one-time SWC Player of the Week and a three-time SWC Newcomer of the Week.[3]\nDue to the scandal, Lambert transferred to Oklahoma State, but because of NCAA transfer rules he had to sit out one full year before becoming eligible to play his final season.[4] In his lone season with the Cowboys, he averaged 13.0\u00a0points and 6.6\u00a0rebounds per game.[5] He then went on to play professionally in Israel before coming home to work for Danfoss and serve as a firefighter.\n",

Lowry (also spelled \"Lowery\"), a tenant farmer, had been on the run after a deadly shootout at the house of planter O. T. Craig on Christmas Day of 1920. Lowry went into hiding in El Paso, Texas; when he was discovered and extradited by train, a group of armed white men boarded the train in Sardis, Mississippi, and took Lowry to Nodena, near Wilson, Arkansas. He was doused in gasoline and burned alive before a mob of 500. A reporter from the Memphis Press witnessed the event, and word of the lynching soon spread around the country, aided by an article William Pickens wrote for The Nation, in which he described eastern Arkansas as \"the American Congo\".[1]\nA detailed account comes from William Pickens, then a journalist and an assistant field secretary for the executive secretary of the NAACP.[2] Pickens is the only source for some details on Lowry; his age, for example, being otherwise unknown except for Pickens's estimate of \"forty years or more\".[2] He and his wife Callie are not listed in the 14th United States census, despite having moved to Arkansas in 1918 from Mississippi.[2] O. T. Craig was a planter in Mississippi County, Arkansas, first name not given in most contemporary accounts but revealed by the same census records to be Osben T. Craig, aged 68 at the time; with 62-year-old wife Mary, children Elizabeth (28), Richard (24), Margret (21), and two further sons.[2] Craig had a reputation for being ornery: he mistreated his Black tenants and exploited them.[3] Lowry was a proud, tall man; he was over six feet tall and, according to later testimony from another one of Craig's tenants, Mrs. Lucy Oliver, \"he didn't take nothing off of nobody\". He had attained the highest possible level within his Masonic order, a rank given to those of \"outstanding character and leadership qualities\".[3]\nThe shooting and the lynching were consequences of Lowry's indenture with Craig. Weeks before the events, Lowry had come to ask for his settlement, meaning a complete account of all debts and credits, and of how much money, if any, was due to him. Lowry, who had a wife and child and was a hardworking man who did not drink, had come to work for Craig some two years before. Craig was a powerful man and did not want his workers to leave or have freedom of movement; his son Richard was the local postmaster and clerk of the local court. Lowry needed the settlement if he ever wanted to leave, since without it he could not prove that he was not indebted to Craig, but Craig refused to provide the documents. Richard hit Lowry, who left but made a promise he would be back. He did so a few weeks later, while the Craigs were having their Christmas dinner, and was told to leave; Craig hit him with a piece of wood, and then Richard shot Lowry, who pulled his own gun and returned fire, killing O. T. Craig and his wife, and wounding Richard and his brother. Then, he ran.[4]\n",

Clayton and twin-brother to U.S. Attorney W.H.H. Clayton.\nClayton was born on a farm in Bethel Township, Pennsylvania, to John and Ann Glover Clayton.[1] The Clayton family was descended from early Quaker settlers of Pennsylvania. Clayton's ancestor William Clayton emigrated from Chichester, England, was a personal friend of William Penn, one of nine justices who sat at the Upland Court in 1681, and a member of Penn's Council.[2]\n",

Due to the fact he was already dead, Wood was never prosecuted for them and the three murders officially remain unsolved.\nOn November 28, 1912, a black woman named Alice Turner was shot and killed near the Frazier Pike in Little Rock in an apparent robbery. Initially, police arrested preacher W. A. Pearson on suspicion of being the killer, as it was determined that his shotgun had been used in the murder - however, Pearson convinced the authorities that it had been stolen from him and was then released.[1] On December 3, Wood, a laborer who worked at a nearby sawmill, was arrested for the murder after officers concluded that he had sold the murder weapon at a pawn shop. His wife Sarah was briefly detained on suspicion of harboring a fugitive, but was released after she promised to help the officers locate the stolen money.[2]\nAfter extensive questioning, Wood confessed that he had killed Turner because he wanted to steal a $10 bill she had shown to him, and that he had stolen $75 after killing her. He claimed that he alone was responsible, and that his brother James \u2013 who had been arrested as an accomplice \u2013 had nothing to do with the case.[1] As a result of this confession, James Wood was released, while Elijah was charged with first-degree murder and ordered to stand trial on January 9, 1913.[3]\n",

They were overseers of inmates who were swinging hoes. In instances when inmates escaped, long line riders released bloodhounds to track them.[4] Long line riders at the Cummins Prison farm were made up of inmates, called trusties, who were often serving long prison sentences for armed robbery or murder.[3]\n",

        "paragraph": "Devil's Knot: The True Story of the West Memphis Three is a 2002 true crime book by Mara Leveritt, about the 1993 murders of three eight-year-old children and the subsequent trials of three teenagers charged with and convicted of the crimes. The names of the three teens convicted - Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley - would come to be known as the West Memphis Three. Leveritt's book revolves around the central idea that the three teenagers' convictions stemmed from \"Satanic panic\" rather than actual evidence. The book also focuses on one of the victim's stepfathers and his possible connection with the murders. All three teenagers convicted were released on August 19, 2011. A film based on the book, Devil's Knot, was released in 2013.[1]\nOn May 5, 1993, Christopher Byers, Michael Moore, and Steven Branch went missing from their homes in West Memphis, Arkansas.  The next day, their bodies were found in the woods near their homes with evidence showing they had been brutally beaten and savagely murdered. In Byers' case the evidence revealed that he had been castrated, and his genitals skinned before he was killed. News of the boys' deaths and the manner in which it happened soon reached the inhabitants of the small community. The rumor then spread that the nature of Byers' death, in particular  hinted that the deaths may have been related to a Satanic ritual.\nWeeks after the murders, a local woman, Vicki Hutcheson, brought her eight-year-old son Aaron to see the police. Aaron claimed to have witnessed the kidnapping of his three friends. Vicki volunteered to help the investigation by becoming \"involved\" with both Jessie and Damien. Hutcheson was a neighbor of Jessie's and coaxed him into setting up a \"meeting\" with Damien, so Hutcheson and Damien could get to know each other. Vicki would later claim to the police that she had attended an Esbat with both men. Years after the trials, Hutcheson would admit that she had lied about attending the Esbat. Over the months that led up to the arrests and trials, her son Aaron would also change his account of what happened numerous times; each time the story became more outrageous and unbelievable.\n",

During the subsequent investigation, witnesses reported that they had seen the woman riding accompanied by a skinny, long-haired man on a black bike.[4]\nThere were no leads in the case for five months, until a detective from Fort Lauderdale, John Curcio, saw a program airing the case on TV. He had been a member of an investigative unit which had captured Ronald Henry Stewart, a serial rapist who had terrorized women in Broward County and Harrison County, Mississippi during the late 1980s,[5] and took notice that Stewart resembled the suspect sketch, in addition to being in possession of a black bike at the time of his arrest.[4] A witness who said they had seen Regina and her alleged killer on the beach pointed to Ronald as the man she had seen, and he was soon charged with Harrison's murder. In order to avoid the death penalty, Stewart entered a plea of no contest and was given 50 years imprisonment in January 1985, to run concurrently with his other sentences for the sexual offenses.[3] Although several factors pointed towards his innocence in the case, including the fact that his fingerprints did not match those found at the crime scene, Stewart confessed to the crime. He never repudiated the confession nor claimed it was coerced while serving his time.[4] Stewart died behind bars from cancer in 2008.[5]\n",

In addition, Stanford published six shorter books of poetry throughout his twenties, and three posthumous collections of his writings (as well as a book of selected poems) have also been published.\nFrank Stanford was born Francis Gildart Smith on August 1, 1948, to widow Dorothy Margaret Smith at the Emery Memorial Home in Richton, Mississippi.[1][2][3] He was soon adopted by a single divorcee named Dorothy Gilbert Alter (1911\u20132000),[4] who was Firestone's first female manager.[1][5] In 1952, Gilbert married successful Memphis levee engineer[5] Albert Franklin Stanford (1884\u20131963),[6] who subsequently also adopted \"Frankie\" and his younger, adoptive sister, \"Ruthie\" (Bettina Ruth). Stanford attended Sherwood Elementary School and Sherwood Junior High School in Memphis until 1961 when the family moved to Mountain Home, Arkansas, following A. F. Stanford's retirement;[2][7] Stanford finished junior high school in Mountain Home.[7] The elder Stanford died after the poet's freshman year at Mountain Home High School.[2][6][7]\nIn 1964, as a junior,[7] Stanford entered Subiaco Academy near Paris, Arkansas, in the Ouachita Mountains. He entered the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville where he started to write poetry, and soon became known throughout the Fayetteville literary community,[5][8] and published poetry in the student literary magazine, Preview.[9] However, he left the university, never earning a degree.[10]\n",

Brough led a contingent of 583 US soldiers from Camp Pike, with a 12-gun  machine gun battalion.[7]\nAccording to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas, \"the Elaine Massacre was by far the deadliest racial confrontation in Arkansas history and possibly the bloodiest racial conflict in the history of the United States\".[9][10]\nAfter the massacre, state officials concocted an elaborate cover-up, claiming that blacks were planning an insurrection.[8] National newspapers repeated the falsehood that blacks in Arkansas were staging an insurrection.[8] A New York Times headline read, \"Planned Massacre of Whites Today,\" and the Arkansas Gazette (the leading newspaper in Arkansas) wrote that Elaine was \"a zone of negro insurrection\".[8] Subsequent to this reporting, more than 100 African Americans were indicted, with 12 being sentenced to death by electrocution.[8] After a years-long legal battle by the NAACP, the 12 men were acquitted.[8]\n",

It is also a part of the MacArthur Park Historic District, in Little Rock, Arkansas.\nBuilt between 1840 and 1841, it was part of Little Rock's first U.S. military installation. Since decommissioning, the building has housed two local museums. It was home to the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities from 1942 to 1997 and the MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History since 2001. It has also housed the Little Rock \u00c6sthetic Club since 1894. The building receives its name from its distinct octagonal tower.[2][3] Besides being the last remaining structure of the original U.S. military installation and one of the oldest buildings in central Arkansas, it was also the birthplace of General Douglas MacArthur, who became the supreme commander of U.S. forces in the South Pacific during World War II. It was also the starting place of the Camden Expedition during the American Civil War.\n",

Another son, Karl, was born in 1930. Little is known about Lester's upbringing and early life, but after graduating from school, he took on a job as a teacher at a Sunday school in Galesburg.[1] In 1935, he was arrested and convicted for armed robbery in Chicago, for which he served a two-year prison term at the Joliet Penitentiary. Brockelhurst was paroled in 1937 and went to Rockford, where he met 18-year-old Bernice Felton, who was also from Galesburg. The two quickly befriended and fell in love with each other, and on March 31 of that year, the couple embarked on a 18-state wide crime spree.[1]\nOn the same day as their sudden disappearance from the city, a 47-year-old local tailor named John Albin Theander disappeared along with his car. Some time later, his body was found on the outskirts of Rockford, with a single bullet hole in his head.[1] After killing him, Brockelhurst and Felton travelled to Salt Lake City and then onto Dallas, before winding up in Fort Worth on April 28. There, they held up a tavern owned by a man named Jack Griffith, who attempted to defend his property from the two criminals. In response, Lester shot and killed him on the spot, and the couple fled the state.[1] Their next destination was Little Rock, Arkansas, and on May 6, they ditched Theander's car and travelled to Memphis, Tennessee on foot. There, they were picked up by Victor A. Gates, a wealthy landowner who resided in Little Rock, who drove them there. When they reached Arkansas, Brockelhurst shot Gates in the head, robbed him of his money and valuables and then threw the body into a ditch.[1]\n",

The owners attempted to replace them with black strikebreakers. During union protests, there was a scuffle between African-American worker Fred Rouse and some of the strikers. This resulted in Rouse firing his gun, wounding two white strikers who happened to be brothers.[1][2]\nEnraged, the whites seized, beat, and stabbed him. He was presumed to be dead. However, when the police retrieved his body from the mob, they realized that he was still alive. They took him to the City & County Hospital (330 E. 4th St.).[3][4] He spent several days recovering in the segregated ward, which was located in the basement. When members of the striking union heard that Rouse was still alive, a mob of about 30 men snuck into the hospital and were able to identify him by his severe skull injury. Despite the pleas of the night nurse to spare him, the mob dragged him out of the hospital in his nightgown. He was strung up on a tree at the corner of NE 12th Street and Samuels Avenue in Fort Worth, Texas. The white mob took turns riddling his mutilated body with gunshots.[4]\n",

A few months before, guerrillas had attacked a force of 25 Union troops in the area.\nThe event was discussed secretly and nearly lost until a historian wrote about it in a history quarterly in 1974. More research has been published on this topic, and a memorial to the victims was erected in 2006. \nIn 1862, after the Battle of Pea Ridge in Arkansas, Isaac Murphy of Huntsville had received death threats and was forced to flee his home. He had represented Madison County in the state House but was known to have voted against secession at the start of the war. He was with the Army in Missouri. By the fall of 1862, his daughters wished to visit him in Pea Ridge, Missouri. The Union Army escorted them to return to their home of Huntsville, then under Union control.\n",
